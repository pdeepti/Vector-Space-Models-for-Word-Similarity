the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .
bildunterschrift : crucified puppets hang on a cross during a demonstration against church abuse in berlin new broom sweeps clean vatican expert marco politi of the left-wing newspaper il fatto quotidiano told journalists that the disciplinary measures show " benedict xvi 's absolute wish to carry out a ' clean sweep ' , describing the drive as " an essential moral and spiritual battle . "
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack . "
the jury 's out on german bishop meanwhile , germany is grappling with a scandal involving one of the country 's most divisive bishops , walter mixa of augsburg .
he has admitted to hitting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archbishop of augsburg , walter mixa , at first denied allegations of physical abuse the head of the german church , robert zollitsch had asked mixa to " take a break " - an unprecedented move , according to german media . in a letter to the german-born pope benedict , bishop mixa , who is also military chaplain to the german bundeswehr , said : " i am and have been fully aware of my own weaknesses .
i ask forgiveness from everyone i may have acted wrongly towards and from everyone to whom i may have caused harm . "
archbishop zollitsch met with the pope on march 12 to discuss sexual abuse against children at church institutions after german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said a " wall of silence " from the vatican was hampering probes of sexual abuse of children .
damage control on friday , mixa 's pr advisor dirk hermann voss was sacked .
voss , a trained lawyer , had described the public debate about abuse and also a finance scandal involving bishop mixa as a " media campaign against the church . "
meanwhile , the german church reform group " wir sind kirche " called for a swift decision about bishop mixa 's offer to resign. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.04.2010 merkel says greek aid depends on ' credible ' savings plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants strict conditions imposed for any eu aid debt-ridden greece has appealed to the eu and imf for a bail-out .
but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .
bildunterschrift : crucified puppets hang on a cross during a demonstration against church abuse in berlin new broom sweeps clean vatican expert marco politi of the left-wing newspaper il fatto quotidiano told journalists that the disciplinary measures show " benedict xvi 's absolute wish to carry out a ' clean sweep ' , describing the drive as " an essential moral and spiritual battle . "
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack . "
the jury 's out on german bishop meanwhile , germany is grappling with a scandal involving one of the country 's most divisive bishops , walter mixa of augsburg .
he has admitted to hitting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archbishop of augsburg , walter mixa , at first denied allegations of physical abuse the head of the german church , robert zollitsch had asked mixa to " take a break " - an unprecedented move , according to german media . in a letter to the german-born pope benedict , bishop mixa , who is also military chaplain to the german bundeswehr , said : " i am and have been fully aware of my own weaknesses .
i ask forgiveness from everyone i may have acted wrongly towards and from everyone to whom i may have caused harm . "
archbishop zollitsch met with the pope on march 12 to discuss sexual abuse against children at church institutions after german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said a " wall of silence " from the vatican was hampering probes of sexual abuse of children .
damage control on friday , mixa 's pr advisor dirk hermann voss was sacked .
voss , a trained lawyer , had described the public debate about abuse and also a finance scandal involving bishop mixa as a " media campaign against the church . "
meanwhile , the german church reform group " wir sind kirche " called for a swift decision about bishop mixa 's offer to resign. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !
theobald lost confidence and went silent .
this will partly have been the consequence of pope 's attack .
i think , however , that it was also because theobald had started to realize that this was not a single author play , but that john fletcher had had a hand in it . fletcher 's involvement would have been a tremendous embarrassment to theobald .
it 's not until fairly recently that people have recognized collaborative writing to be the standard condition of elizabethan and jacobean authorship .
more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .
what is really exciting about the cardenio play , however , is that it is based on an episode in don quixote .
shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .
at the same time , henriques has also conceived a fancy for a country maid called violante .
so the double falsehood of the title is the betrayal of these two women by henriques and the way in which that betrayal is atoned for in the end .
it 's a tragic-comedy , really . is " double falsehood " any good ? i think the play is very good for what it is .
if judged by the standard of late shakespearean or fletcherean plays , it 's a little simple , a little stripped down .
but people will get an opportunity to judge this i hope , because i believe the royal shakespeare company is going to put it on next year .

more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .
what is really exciting about the cardenio play , however , is that it is based on an episode in don quixote .
shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .
at the same time , henriques has also conceived a fancy for a country maid called violante .
so the double falsehood of the title is the betrayal of these two women by henriques and the way in which that betrayal is atoned for in the end .
it 's a tragic-comedy , really . is " double falsehood " any good ? i think the play is very good for what it is .
if judged by the standard of late shakespearean or fletcherean plays , it 's a little simple , a little stripped down .
but people will get an opportunity to judge this i hope , because i believe the royal shakespeare company is going to put it on next year .
the rsc director is a hard man to pin down , but i announced it on radio 4 , so i hope i 've committed him . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .

this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .
muscular germans hold advantage over patient french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's use of wingers like robben has been inspired bayern have grown into the champions league as the competition has progressed and have developed a winning strategy that teams considered more adept to europe have struggled to deal with .
louis van gaal has bayern playing in a very robust style where combative midfield players like mark von bommel and bastian schweinsteiger draw opponents into battle , leaving the wings free for arjen robben and franck ribery to exploit .
this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !
theobald lost confidence and went silent .
this will partly have been the consequence of pope 's attack .
i think , however , that it was also because theobald had started to realize that this was not a single author play , but that john fletcher had had a hand in it . fletcher 's involvement would have been a tremendous embarrassment to theobald .
it 's not until fairly recently that people have recognized collaborative writing to be the standard condition of elizabethan and jacobean authorship .
more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .
what is really exciting about the cardenio play , however , is that it is based on an episode in don quixote .
shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .
at the same time , henriques has also conceived a fancy for a country maid called violante .
so the double falsehood of the title is the betrayal of these two women by henriques and the way in which that betrayal is atoned for in the end .
it 's a tragic-comedy , really . is " double falsehood " any good ? i think the play is very good for what it is .
if judged by the standard of late shakespearean or fletcherean plays , it 's a little simple , a little stripped down .
but people will get an opportunity to judge this i hope , because i believe the royal shakespeare company is going to put it on next year .

but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incumbent social democrat is favored to win , but a far-right candidate is causing controversy . barbara rosenkranz , a mother of ten who describes herself as a housewife , is only expected to receive around ten percent of the vote in the austrian presidential elections .
but even though she has next to no chance of winning , her candidacy is still causing a stir . " i think there is no doubt she is not following an agenda that is very liberal or european , " said arno behrens , a researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
the 51 year-old rosenkranz was put forward as a candidate by the far-right freedom party , founded by right-wing nationalist joerg haider .
the freedom party is staunchly anti-immigrant and opposes the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians are allowed to vote at age 16 however , analysts say rosenkranz 's success stems less from her personal political views than from an utter lack of competition .
lack of options incumbent austrian president heinz fischer was so popular in the early polls that the other major party , the right-of-center christian democrats , refused to put up a candidate of their own , creating a vacuum for conservative voters , said dr. franz fallend , a political scientist at the university of salzburg . " if the christian democrats had put up another candidate , no voters , or only very few , would consider voting for her .
but now there is no right-wing or right-of-center candidate , so there are more voters who might consider voting for barbara rosenkrantz , " fallend told deutsche welle .
behrens says this has put austrian conservatives in a difficult position .
" it 's between a far-right candidate and a socialist .
so the options for conservatives are to vote for the extreme right candidate or not vote at all , " behrens told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenkranz opposes the eu and a multi-cultural europe right-wing woes like germany , austria has struggled to come to terms with its nazi past .
however , austria has a different post-war history with de-nazification , said behrens , and this contributes to its current political situation . " austria has a problem with the right-wing , and people voting for what would , in germany , be considered an extremist right-wing party , " he said .
however , polling data show it 's almost certain that incumbent heinz fischer will be re-elected on sunday , leaving analysts hopeful that rosenkranz 's candidacy will remain a problem of austria 's past , rather than its future .

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .
bildunterschrift : crucified puppets hang on a cross during a demonstration against church abuse in berlin new broom sweeps clean vatican expert marco politi of the left-wing newspaper il fatto quotidiano told journalists that the disciplinary measures show " benedict xvi 's absolute wish to carry out a ' clean sweep ' , describing the drive as " an essential moral and spiritual battle . "
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack . "
the jury 's out on german bishop meanwhile , germany is grappling with a scandal involving one of the country 's most divisive bishops , walter mixa of augsburg .
he has admitted to hitting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archbishop of augsburg , walter mixa , at first denied allegations of physical abuse the head of the german church , robert zollitsch had asked mixa to " take a break " - an unprecedented move , according to german media . in a letter to the german-born pope benedict , bishop mixa , who is also military chaplain to the german bundeswehr , said : " i am and have been fully aware of my own weaknesses .
i ask forgiveness from everyone i may have acted wrongly towards and from everyone to whom i may have caused harm . "
archbishop zollitsch met with the pope on march 12 to discuss sexual abuse against children at church institutions after german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said a " wall of silence " from the vatican was hampering probes of sexual abuse of children .
damage control on friday , mixa 's pr advisor dirk hermann voss was sacked .
voss , a trained lawyer , had described the public debate about abuse and also a finance scandal involving bishop mixa as a " media campaign against the church . "
meanwhile , the german church reform group " wir sind kirche " called for a swift decision about bishop mixa 's offer to resign. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 24.04.2010 right-wing ' housewife ' wants to be austria 's next president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenkranz represents the party of deceased right-wing leader joerg haider on sunday , austrians will go to the polls to choose a new president .
the incumbent social democrat is favored to win , but a far-right candidate is causing controversy . barbara rosenkranz , a mother of ten who describes herself as a housewife , is only expected to receive around ten percent of the vote in the austrian presidential elections .
but even though she has next to no chance of winning , her candidacy is still causing a stir . " i think there is no doubt she is not following an agenda that is very liberal or european , " said arno behrens , a researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
the 51 year-old rosenkranz was put forward as a candidate by the far-right freedom party , founded by right-wing nationalist joerg haider .
the freedom party is staunchly anti-immigrant and opposes the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians are allowed to vote at age 16 however , analysts say rosenkranz 's success stems less from her personal political views than from an utter lack of competition .
lack of options incumbent austrian president heinz fischer was so popular in the early polls that the other major party , the right-of-center christian democrats , refused to put up a candidate of their own , creating a vacuum for conservative voters , said dr. franz fallend , a political scientist at the university of salzburg . " if the christian democrats had put up another candidate , no voters , or only very few , would consider voting for her .
but now there is no right-wing or right-of-center candidate , so there are more voters who might consider voting for barbara rosenkrantz , " fallend told deutsche welle .
behrens says this has put austrian conservatives in a difficult position .
" it 's between a far-right candidate and a socialist .
so the options for conservatives are to vote for the extreme right candidate or not vote at all , " behrens told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenkranz opposes the eu and a multi-cultural europe right-wing woes like germany , austria has struggled to come to terms with its nazi past .
however , austria has a different post-war history with de-nazification , said behrens , and this contributes to its current political situation . " austria has a problem with the right-wing , and people voting for what would , in germany , be considered an extremist right-wing party , " he said .
however , polling data show it 's almost certain that incumbent heinz fischer will be re-elected on sunday , leaving analysts hopeful that rosenkranz 's candidacy will remain a problem of austria 's past , rather than its future .

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .
bildunterschrift : crucified puppets hang on a cross during a demonstration against church abuse in berlin new broom sweeps clean vatican expert marco politi of the left-wing newspaper il fatto quotidiano told journalists that the disciplinary measures show " benedict xvi 's absolute wish to carry out a ' clean sweep ' , describing the drive as " an essential moral and spiritual battle . "
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack . "
the jury 's out on german bishop meanwhile , germany is grappling with a scandal involving one of the country 's most divisive bishops , walter mixa of augsburg .
he has admitted to hitting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archbishop of augsburg , walter mixa , at first denied allegations of physical abuse the head of the german church , robert zollitsch had asked mixa to " take a break " - an unprecedented move , according to german media . in a letter to the german-born pope benedict , bishop mixa , who is also military chaplain to the german bundeswehr , said : " i am and have been fully aware of my own weaknesses .
i ask forgiveness from everyone i may have acted wrongly towards and from everyone to whom i may have caused harm . "
archbishop zollitsch met with the pope on march 12 to discuss sexual abuse against children at church institutions after german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said a " wall of silence " from the vatican was hampering probes of sexual abuse of children .
damage control on friday , mixa 's pr advisor dirk hermann voss was sacked .
voss , a trained lawyer , had described the public debate about abuse and also a finance scandal involving bishop mixa as a " media campaign against the church . "
meanwhile , the german church reform group " wir sind kirche " called for a swift decision about bishop mixa 's offer to resign. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.04.2010 merkel says greek aid depends on ' credible ' savings plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants strict conditions imposed for any eu aid debt-ridden greece has appealed to the eu and imf for a bail-out .
but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incumbent social democrat is favored to win , but a far-right candidate is causing controversy . barbara rosenkranz , a mother of ten who describes herself as a housewife , is only expected to receive around ten percent of the vote in the austrian presidential elections .
but even though she has next to no chance of winning , her candidacy is still causing a stir . " i think there is no doubt she is not following an agenda that is very liberal or european , " said arno behrens , a researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
the 51 year-old rosenkranz was put forward as a candidate by the far-right freedom party , founded by right-wing nationalist joerg haider .
the freedom party is staunchly anti-immigrant and opposes the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians are allowed to vote at age 16 however , analysts say rosenkranz 's success stems less from her personal political views than from an utter lack of competition .
lack of options incumbent austrian president heinz fischer was so popular in the early polls that the other major party , the right-of-center christian democrats , refused to put up a candidate of their own , creating a vacuum for conservative voters , said dr. franz fallend , a political scientist at the university of salzburg . " if the christian democrats had put up another candidate , no voters , or only very few , would consider voting for her .
but now there is no right-wing or right-of-center candidate , so there are more voters who might consider voting for barbara rosenkrantz , " fallend told deutsche welle .
behrens says this has put austrian conservatives in a difficult position .
" it 's between a far-right candidate and a socialist .
so the options for conservatives are to vote for the extreme right candidate or not vote at all , " behrens told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenkranz opposes the eu and a multi-cultural europe right-wing woes like germany , austria has struggled to come to terms with its nazi past .
however , austria has a different post-war history with de-nazification , said behrens , and this contributes to its current political situation . " austria has a problem with the right-wing , and people voting for what would , in germany , be considered an extremist right-wing party , " he said .
however , polling data show it 's almost certain that incumbent heinz fischer will be re-elected on sunday , leaving analysts hopeful that rosenkranz 's candidacy will remain a problem of austria 's past , rather than its future .

the event was staged by the youth wing of the nationalist dashnak-tsutyun party .
the demonstrators burned a banner with images of turkish leaders .
they carried placards such as " we demand compensation from turkey ! " and " the recognition time is now ! "
a steady stream of people marched to a hilltop to lay flowers at a memorial to the massacres , armenians insist constituted genocide .
the march comes a day after armenia said it was halting ratification of a historic reconciliation accord with turkey that would have normalized ties after decades of hostility over the killings .
despite the ongoing political tensions , the anniversary was marked for the first time in turkey .
human rights activists and artists commemorated the massacres , breaking a long-held taboo .
turkey admits " mistakes " armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were systematically killed between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire , the predecessor of modern turkey , was falling apart .
turkey denies that the deaths constituted genocide , saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of civil war and unrest .
in saturday 's edition of turkish newspaper hurriyet , an opinion piece acknowledged that ankara had made ' mistakes ' in the handling of events that led to the enormous suffering of the armenian people in 1915 .
" i think we turks have made a terrible mistake for decades by totally overlooking the enormous suffering that the armenian people went through in 1915 .

but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .

" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .

meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.04.2010 merkel says greek aid depends on ' credible ' savings plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants strict conditions imposed for any eu aid debt-ridden greece has appealed to the eu and imf for a bail-out .
but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

public support for the afghan mission continues to fall . four german soliders killed in a taliban ambush in afghanistan on april 15 were laid to rest on saturday , with german chancellor angela merkel and several cabinet members attending the services .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg offered his condolences to the families of the four , stressing that their deaths were not in vain .
killed in an ambush were major joern radloff , 38 , colonel doctor thomas broer , 33 , sergeant major marius dubnicki , 32 , and sergeant josef kronawitter , 24 .
their funeral , with full military honors , was held in a cathedral in the city of ingolstadt on saturday .
individual burials in the soldiers ' hometowns were scheduled for later on saturday .
thousands of people came to the service in the bavarian city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 24.04.2010 " lost " shakespeare play shows bard did n't work alone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was common for playwrights in shakespeares time to work together we 'd like to think of shakespeare as a lone genius .
but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !
theobald lost confidence and went silent .
this will partly have been the consequence of pope 's attack .
i think , however , that it was also because theobald had started to realize that this was not a single author play , but that john fletcher had had a hand in it . fletcher 's involvement would have been a tremendous embarrassment to theobald .
it 's not until fairly recently that people have recognized collaborative writing to be the standard condition of elizabethan and jacobean authorship .
more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .
what is really exciting about the cardenio play , however , is that it is based on an episode in don quixote .
shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .
at the same time , henriques has also conceived a fancy for a country maid called violante .
so the double falsehood of the title is the betrayal of these two women by henriques and the way in which that betrayal is atoned for in the end .
it 's a tragic-comedy , really . is " double falsehood " any good ? i think the play is very good for what it is .
if judged by the standard of late shakespearean or fletcherean plays , it 's a little simple , a little stripped down .
but people will get an opportunity to judge this i hope , because i believe the royal shakespeare company is going to put it on next year .
the rsc director is a hard man to pin down , but i announced it on radio 4 , so i hope i 've committed him . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !
theobald lost confidence and went silent .
this will partly have been the consequence of pope 's attack .
i think , however , that it was also because theobald had started to realize that this was not a single author play , but that john fletcher had had a hand in it . fletcher 's involvement would have been a tremendous embarrassment to theobald .
it 's not until fairly recently that people have recognized collaborative writing to be the standard condition of elizabethan and jacobean authorship .
more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .
what is really exciting about the cardenio play , however , is that it is based on an episode in don quixote .
shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .
at the same time , henriques has also conceived a fancy for a country maid called violante .
so the double falsehood of the title is the betrayal of these two women by henriques and the way in which that betrayal is atoned for in the end .
it 's a tragic-comedy , really . is " double falsehood " any good ? i think the play is very good for what it is .
if judged by the standard of late shakespearean or fletcherean plays , it 's a little simple , a little stripped down .
but people will get an opportunity to judge this i hope , because i believe the royal shakespeare company is going to put it on next year .

public support for the afghan mission continues to fall . four german soliders killed in a taliban ambush in afghanistan on april 15 were laid to rest on saturday , with german chancellor angela merkel and several cabinet members attending the services .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg offered his condolences to the families of the four , stressing that their deaths were not in vain .
killed in an ambush were major joern radloff , 38 , colonel doctor thomas broer , 33 , sergeant major marius dubnicki , 32 , and sergeant josef kronawitter , 24 .
their funeral , with full military honors , was held in a cathedral in the city of ingolstadt on saturday .

" there 's still time to avoid the worst , " he said on belgian television on friday , urging all parties to return to the negotiating table .
the issues in brussels have sparked a bitter row among the five flemish and francophone parties that formed the government until the flemish liberal party open vld quit the coalition last thursday , prompting prime minister yves leterme to hand in his resignation on the same day .
crisis could weaken belgium 's eu presidency the latest crisis comes just two months before belgium takes over the rotating presidency of the european union .
king albert ii , who has not yet accepted leterme 's resignation , is keen to solve the crisis without holding snap elections before july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme 's resignation has not yet been accepted by king albert ii the head of open vld , alexander de croo , reiterated on saturday that his party wants a solution to the brussels problem by next thursday .
if no solution is found , the flemish parties , which dominate the governing coalition , have threatened to split bhv without reference to french speakers .
row over rights of francophone belgians at the heart of the feud between belgium 's parties is the ongoing debate about the rights of francophone residents in and around the capital brussels .
french speakers are in the minority in brussels , which lies in the flemish region of flanders .
the governing coalition has so far been unable to find a way to divide the brussels electoral district in a way that satisfies both flemish and francophone residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels is home to around 100,000 french speakers reynders ' appointment is seen as a shrewd move by king albert ii , as reynders is also the head of the liberal francophone party parte mouvement reparateur -lrb- mr -rrb- , which is seen as the most vocal of the french-language parties in the government .
the coalition , which was only formed five months ago , consists of the flemish and francophone christian democrat parties , the flemish and francophone liberal parties and the francophone socialist party .
recent proposals by former prime minister jean-luc dehaene had failed to solve the issue , with francophone parties unhappy with the rights envisaged in dehaene 's plans. ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there 's still time to avoid the worst , " he said on belgian television on friday , urging all parties to return to the negotiating table .
the issues in brussels have sparked a bitter row among the five flemish and francophone parties that formed the government until the flemish liberal party open vld quit the coalition last thursday , prompting prime minister yves leterme to hand in his resignation on the same day .
crisis could weaken belgium 's eu presidency the latest crisis comes just two months before belgium takes over the rotating presidency of the european union .
king albert ii , who has not yet accepted leterme 's resignation , is keen to solve the crisis without holding snap elections before july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme 's resignation has not yet been accepted by king albert ii the head of open vld , alexander de croo , reiterated on saturday that his party wants a solution to the brussels problem by next thursday .
if no solution is found , the flemish parties , which dominate the governing coalition , have threatened to split bhv without reference to french speakers .
row over rights of francophone belgians at the heart of the feud between belgium 's parties is the ongoing debate about the rights of francophone residents in and around the capital brussels .
french speakers are in the minority in brussels , which lies in the flemish region of flanders .
the governing coalition has so far been unable to find a way to divide the brussels electoral district in a way that satisfies both flemish and francophone residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels is home to around 100,000 french speakers reynders ' appointment is seen as a shrewd move by king albert ii , as reynders is also the head of the liberal francophone party parte mouvement reparateur -lrb- mr -rrb- , which is seen as the most vocal of the french-language parties in the government .
the coalition , which was only formed five months ago , consists of the flemish and francophone christian democrat parties , the flemish and francophone liberal parties and the francophone socialist party .
recent proposals by former prime minister jean-luc dehaene had failed to solve the issue , with francophone parties unhappy with the rights envisaged in dehaene 's plans. ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 24.04.2010 " lost " shakespeare play shows bard did n't work alone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was common for playwrights in shakespeares time to work together we 'd like to think of shakespeare as a lone genius .
but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !
theobald lost confidence and went silent .
this will partly have been the consequence of pope 's attack .
i think , however , that it was also because theobald had started to realize that this was not a single author play , but that john fletcher had had a hand in it . fletcher 's involvement would have been a tremendous embarrassment to theobald .
it 's not until fairly recently that people have recognized collaborative writing to be the standard condition of elizabethan and jacobean authorship .
more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .
what is really exciting about the cardenio play , however , is that it is based on an episode in don quixote .
shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .
at the same time , henriques has also conceived a fancy for a country maid called violante .
so the double falsehood of the title is the betrayal of these two women by henriques and the way in which that betrayal is atoned for in the end .
it 's a tragic-comedy , really . is " double falsehood " any good ? i think the play is very good for what it is .
if judged by the standard of late shakespearean or fletcherean plays , it 's a little simple , a little stripped down .
but people will get an opportunity to judge this i hope , because i believe the royal shakespeare company is going to put it on next year .
the rsc director is a hard man to pin down , but i announced it on radio 4 , so i hope i 've committed him . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de greece activates the eu-imf financial rescue package greece 's prime minister george papandreou has asked for the eu-imf bailout deal to be activated immediately .
it is hoped the rescue package will help the recovery of the debt-laden country .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .

this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .
muscular germans hold advantage over patient french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's use of wingers like robben has been inspired bayern have grown into the champions league as the competition has progressed and have developed a winning strategy that teams considered more adept to europe have struggled to deal with .
louis van gaal has bayern playing in a very robust style where combative midfield players like mark von bommel and bastian schweinsteiger draw opponents into battle , leaving the wings free for arjen robben and franck ribery to exploit .
this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .

"
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack . "

he has admitted to hitting children .

i ask forgiveness from everyone i may have acted wrongly towards and from everyone to whom i may have caused harm . "
archbishop zollitsch met with the pope on march 12 to discuss sexual abuse against children at church institutions after german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said a " wall of silence " from the vatican was hampering probes of sexual abuse of children .

the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .
bildunterschrift : crucified puppets hang on a cross during a demonstration against church abuse in berlin new broom sweeps clean vatican expert marco politi of the left-wing newspaper il fatto quotidiano told journalists that the disciplinary measures show " benedict xvi 's absolute wish to carry out a ' clean sweep ' , describing the drive as " an essential moral and spiritual battle . "
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .
bildunterschrift : crucified puppets hang on a cross during a demonstration against church abuse in berlin new broom sweeps clean vatican expert marco politi of the left-wing newspaper il fatto quotidiano told journalists that the disciplinary measures show " benedict xvi 's absolute wish to carry out a ' clean sweep ' , describing the drive as " an essential moral and spiritual battle . "

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .

but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .

but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the event was staged by the youth wing of the nationalist dashnak-tsutyun party .
the demonstrators burned a banner with images of turkish leaders .
they carried placards such as " we demand compensation from turkey ! " and " the recognition time is now ! "
a steady stream of people marched to a hilltop to lay flowers at a memorial to the massacres , armenians insist constituted genocide .
the march comes a day after armenia said it was halting ratification of a historic reconciliation accord with turkey that would have normalized ties after decades of hostility over the killings .
despite the ongoing political tensions , the anniversary was marked for the first time in turkey .
human rights activists and artists commemorated the massacres , breaking a long-held taboo .
turkey admits " mistakes " armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were systematically killed between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire , the predecessor of modern turkey , was falling apart .
turkey denies that the deaths constituted genocide , saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of civil war and unrest .
in saturday 's edition of turkish newspaper hurriyet , an opinion piece acknowledged that ankara had made ' mistakes ' in the handling of events that led to the enormous suffering of the armenian people in 1915 .
" i think we turks have made a terrible mistake for decades by totally overlooking the enormous suffering that the armenian people went through in 1915 .
now is the time to be fairer " , mustafa akyol wrote .
armenia and turkey signed a landmark deal in october to establish diplomatic ties and reopen their border but ratification of the agreement stalled amid mutual accusations that the other side was not committed to reconciliation. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .

athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .

" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .

germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .

the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .

" there 's still time to avoid the worst , " he said on belgian television on friday , urging all parties to return to the negotiating table .
the issues in brussels have sparked a bitter row among the five flemish and francophone parties that formed the government until the flemish liberal party open vld quit the coalition last thursday , prompting prime minister yves leterme to hand in his resignation on the same day .
crisis could weaken belgium 's eu presidency the latest crisis comes just two months before belgium takes over the rotating presidency of the european union .
king albert ii , who has not yet accepted leterme 's resignation , is keen to solve the crisis without holding snap elections before july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme 's resignation has not yet been accepted by king albert ii the head of open vld , alexander de croo , reiterated on saturday that his party wants a solution to the brussels problem by next thursday .
if no solution is found , the flemish parties , which dominate the governing coalition , have threatened to split bhv without reference to french speakers .
row over rights of francophone belgians at the heart of the feud between belgium 's parties is the ongoing debate about the rights of francophone residents in and around the capital brussels .
french speakers are in the minority in brussels , which lies in the flemish region of flanders .
the governing coalition has so far been unable to find a way to divide the brussels electoral district in a way that satisfies both flemish and francophone residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels is home to around 100,000 french speakers reynders ' appointment is seen as a shrewd move by king albert ii , as reynders is also the head of the liberal francophone party parte mouvement reparateur -lrb- mr -rrb- , which is seen as the most vocal of the french-language parties in the government .
the coalition , which was only formed five months ago , consists of the flemish and francophone christian democrat parties , the flemish and francophone liberal parties and the francophone socialist party .
recent proposals by former prime minister jean-luc dehaene had failed to solve the issue , with francophone parties unhappy with the rights envisaged in dehaene 's plans. ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .
bildunterschrift : crucified puppets hang on a cross during a demonstration against church abuse in berlin new broom sweeps clean vatican expert marco politi of the left-wing newspaper il fatto quotidiano told journalists that the disciplinary measures show " benedict xvi 's absolute wish to carry out a ' clean sweep ' , describing the drive as " an essential moral and spiritual battle . "
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack . "
the jury 's out on german bishop meanwhile , germany is grappling with a scandal involving one of the country 's most divisive bishops , walter mixa of augsburg .
he has admitted to hitting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archbishop of augsburg , walter mixa , at first denied allegations of physical abuse the head of the german church , robert zollitsch had asked mixa to " take a break " - an unprecedented move , according to german media . in a letter to the german-born pope benedict , bishop mixa , who is also military chaplain to the german bundeswehr , said : " i am and have been fully aware of my own weaknesses .
i ask forgiveness from everyone i may have acted wrongly towards and from everyone to whom i may have caused harm . "
archbishop zollitsch met with the pope on march 12 to discuss sexual abuse against children at church institutions after german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said a " wall of silence " from the vatican was hampering probes of sexual abuse of children .
damage control on friday , mixa 's pr advisor dirk hermann voss was sacked .
voss , a trained lawyer , had described the public debate about abuse and also a finance scandal involving bishop mixa as a " media campaign against the church . "
meanwhile , the german church reform group " wir sind kirche " called for a swift decision about bishop mixa 's offer to resign. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.04.2010 merkel says greek aid depends on ' credible ' savings plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants strict conditions imposed for any eu aid debt-ridden greece has appealed to the eu and imf for a bail-out .
but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incumbent social democrat is favored to win , but a far-right candidate is causing controversy . barbara rosenkranz , a mother of ten who describes herself as a housewife , is only expected to receive around ten percent of the vote in the austrian presidential elections .
but even though she has next to no chance of winning , her candidacy is still causing a stir . " i think there is no doubt she is not following an agenda that is very liberal or european , " said arno behrens , a researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
the 51 year-old rosenkranz was put forward as a candidate by the far-right freedom party , founded by right-wing nationalist joerg haider .
the freedom party is staunchly anti-immigrant and opposes the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians are allowed to vote at age 16 however , analysts say rosenkranz 's success stems less from her personal political views than from an utter lack of competition .
lack of options incumbent austrian president heinz fischer was so popular in the early polls that the other major party , the right-of-center christian democrats , refused to put up a candidate of their own , creating a vacuum for conservative voters , said dr. franz fallend , a political scientist at the university of salzburg . " if the christian democrats had put up another candidate , no voters , or only very few , would consider voting for her .
but now there is no right-wing or right-of-center candidate , so there are more voters who might consider voting for barbara rosenkrantz , " fallend told deutsche welle .
behrens says this has put austrian conservatives in a difficult position .
" it 's between a far-right candidate and a socialist .
so the options for conservatives are to vote for the extreme right candidate or not vote at all , " behrens told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenkranz opposes the eu and a multi-cultural europe right-wing woes like germany , austria has struggled to come to terms with its nazi past .
however , austria has a different post-war history with de-nazification , said behrens , and this contributes to its current political situation . " austria has a problem with the right-wing , and people voting for what would , in germany , be considered an extremist right-wing party , " he said .
however , polling data show it 's almost certain that incumbent heinz fischer will be re-elected on sunday , leaving analysts hopeful that rosenkranz 's candidacy will remain a problem of austria 's past , rather than its future .

but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the event was staged by the youth wing of the nationalist dashnak-tsutyun party .
the demonstrators burned a banner with images of turkish leaders .
they carried placards such as " we demand compensation from turkey ! " and " the recognition time is now ! "
a steady stream of people marched to a hilltop to lay flowers at a memorial to the massacres , armenians insist constituted genocide .
the march comes a day after armenia said it was halting ratification of a historic reconciliation accord with turkey that would have normalized ties after decades of hostility over the killings .
despite the ongoing political tensions , the anniversary was marked for the first time in turkey .
human rights activists and artists commemorated the massacres , breaking a long-held taboo .
turkey admits " mistakes " armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were systematically killed between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire , the predecessor of modern turkey , was falling apart .
turkey denies that the deaths constituted genocide , saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of civil war and unrest .
in saturday 's edition of turkish newspaper hurriyet , an opinion piece acknowledged that ankara had made ' mistakes ' in the handling of events that led to the enormous suffering of the armenian people in 1915 .
" i think we turks have made a terrible mistake for decades by totally overlooking the enormous suffering that the armenian people went through in 1915 .
now is the time to be fairer " , mustafa akyol wrote .
armenia and turkey signed a landmark deal in october to establish diplomatic ties and reopen their border but ratification of the agreement stalled amid mutual accusations that the other side was not committed to reconciliation. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .
muscular germans hold advantage over patient french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's use of wingers like robben has been inspired bayern have grown into the champions league as the competition has progressed and have developed a winning strategy that teams considered more adept to europe have struggled to deal with .
louis van gaal has bayern playing in a very robust style where combative midfield players like mark von bommel and bastian schweinsteiger draw opponents into battle , leaving the wings free for arjen robben and franck ribery to exploit .
this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .
muscular germans hold advantage over patient french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's use of wingers like robben has been inspired bayern have grown into the champions league as the competition has progressed and have developed a winning strategy that teams considered more adept to europe have struggled to deal with .
louis van gaal has bayern playing in a very robust style where combative midfield players like mark von bommel and bastian schweinsteiger draw opponents into battle , leaving the wings free for arjen robben and franck ribery to exploit .
this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .
bildunterschrift : crucified puppets hang on a cross during a demonstration against church abuse in berlin new broom sweeps clean vatican expert marco politi of the left-wing newspaper il fatto quotidiano told journalists that the disciplinary measures show " benedict xvi 's absolute wish to carry out a ' clean sweep ' , describing the drive as " an essential moral and spiritual battle . "
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .

archbishop zollitsch met with the pope on march 12 to discuss sexual abuse against children at church institutions after german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said a " wall of silence " from the vatican was hampering probes of sexual abuse of children .

" there 's still time to avoid the worst , " he said on belgian television on friday , urging all parties to return to the negotiating table .
the issues in brussels have sparked a bitter row among the five flemish and francophone parties that formed the government until the flemish liberal party open vld quit the coalition last thursday , prompting prime minister yves leterme to hand in his resignation on the same day .
crisis could weaken belgium 's eu presidency the latest crisis comes just two months before belgium takes over the rotating presidency of the european union .
king albert ii , who has not yet accepted leterme 's resignation , is keen to solve the crisis without holding snap elections before july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme 's resignation has not yet been accepted by king albert ii the head of open vld , alexander de croo , reiterated on saturday that his party wants a solution to the brussels problem by next thursday .
if no solution is found , the flemish parties , which dominate the governing coalition , have threatened to split bhv without reference to french speakers .
row over rights of francophone belgians at the heart of the feud between belgium 's parties is the ongoing debate about the rights of francophone residents in and around the capital brussels .

the governing coalition has so far been unable to find a way to divide the brussels electoral district in a way that satisfies both flemish and francophone residents .

the coalition , which was only formed five months ago , consists of the flemish and francophone christian democrat parties , the flemish and francophone liberal parties and the francophone socialist party .
recent proposals by former prime minister jean-luc dehaene had failed to solve the issue , with francophone parties unhappy with the rights envisaged in dehaene 's plans. ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the event was staged by the youth wing of the nationalist dashnak-tsutyun party .
the demonstrators burned a banner with images of turkish leaders .
they carried placards such as " we demand compensation from turkey ! " and " the recognition time is now ! "
a steady stream of people marched to a hilltop to lay flowers at a memorial to the massacres , armenians insist constituted genocide .
the march comes a day after armenia said it was halting ratification of a historic reconciliation accord with turkey that would have normalized ties after decades of hostility over the killings .
despite the ongoing political tensions , the anniversary was marked for the first time in turkey .
human rights activists and artists commemorated the massacres , breaking a long-held taboo .
turkey admits " mistakes " armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were systematically killed between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire , the predecessor of modern turkey , was falling apart .
turkey denies that the deaths constituted genocide , saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of civil war and unrest .
in saturday 's edition of turkish newspaper hurriyet , an opinion piece acknowledged that ankara had made ' mistakes ' in the handling of events that led to the enormous suffering of the armenian people in 1915 .
" i think we turks have made a terrible mistake for decades by totally overlooking the enormous suffering that the armenian people went through in 1915 .
now is the time to be fairer " , mustafa akyol wrote .
armenia and turkey signed a landmark deal in october to establish diplomatic ties and reopen their border but ratification of the agreement stalled amid mutual accusations that the other side was not committed to reconciliation. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .

athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .

however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .

" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .

germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .

“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the event was staged by the youth wing of the nationalist dashnak-tsutyun party .
the demonstrators burned a banner with images of turkish leaders .
they carried placards such as " we demand compensation from turkey ! " and " the recognition time is now ! "
a steady stream of people marched to a hilltop to lay flowers at a memorial to the massacres , armenians insist constituted genocide .
the march comes a day after armenia said it was halting ratification of a historic reconciliation accord with turkey that would have normalized ties after decades of hostility over the killings .
despite the ongoing political tensions , the anniversary was marked for the first time in turkey .
human rights activists and artists commemorated the massacres , breaking a long-held taboo .
turkey admits " mistakes " armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were systematically killed between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire , the predecessor of modern turkey , was falling apart .
turkey denies that the deaths constituted genocide , saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of civil war and unrest .
in saturday 's edition of turkish newspaper hurriyet , an opinion piece acknowledged that ankara had made ' mistakes ' in the handling of events that led to the enormous suffering of the armenian people in 1915 .
" i think we turks have made a terrible mistake for decades by totally overlooking the enormous suffering that the armenian people went through in 1915 .
now is the time to be fairer " , mustafa akyol wrote .
armenia and turkey signed a landmark deal in october to establish diplomatic ties and reopen their border but ratification of the agreement stalled amid mutual accusations that the other side was not committed to reconciliation. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .

after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .
muscular germans hold advantage over patient french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's use of wingers like robben has been inspired bayern have grown into the champions league as the competition has progressed and have developed a winning strategy that teams considered more adept to europe have struggled to deal with .
louis van gaal has bayern playing in a very robust style where combative midfield players like mark von bommel and bastian schweinsteiger draw opponents into battle , leaving the wings free for arjen robben and franck ribery to exploit .
this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !
theobald lost confidence and went silent .
this will partly have been the consequence of pope 's attack .
i think , however , that it was also because theobald had started to realize that this was not a single author play , but that john fletcher had had a hand in it . fletcher 's involvement would have been a tremendous embarrassment to theobald .
it 's not until fairly recently that people have recognized collaborative writing to be the standard condition of elizabethan and jacobean authorship .
more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .
what is really exciting about the cardenio play , however , is that it is based on an episode in don quixote .
shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .
at the same time , henriques has also conceived a fancy for a country maid called violante .
so the double falsehood of the title is the betrayal of these two women by henriques and the way in which that betrayal is atoned for in the end .
it 's a tragic-comedy , really . is " double falsehood " any good ? i think the play is very good for what it is .
if judged by the standard of late shakespearean or fletcherean plays , it 's a little simple , a little stripped down .
but people will get an opportunity to judge this i hope , because i believe the royal shakespeare company is going to put it on next year .

shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .
muscular germans hold advantage over patient french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's use of wingers like robben has been inspired bayern have grown into the champions league as the competition has progressed and have developed a winning strategy that teams considered more adept to europe have struggled to deal with .
louis van gaal has bayern playing in a very robust style where combative midfield players like mark von bommel and bastian schweinsteiger draw opponents into battle , leaving the wings free for arjen robben and franck ribery to exploit .
this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .
bildunterschrift : crucified puppets hang on a cross during a demonstration against church abuse in berlin new broom sweeps clean vatican expert marco politi of the left-wing newspaper il fatto quotidiano told journalists that the disciplinary measures show " benedict xvi 's absolute wish to carry out a ' clean sweep ' , describing the drive as " an essential moral and spiritual battle . "
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack . "
the jury 's out on german bishop meanwhile , germany is grappling with a scandal involving one of the country 's most divisive bishops , walter mixa of augsburg .
he has admitted to hitting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archbishop of augsburg , walter mixa , at first denied allegations of physical abuse the head of the german church , robert zollitsch had asked mixa to " take a break " - an unprecedented move , according to german media . in a letter to the german-born pope benedict , bishop mixa , who is also military chaplain to the german bundeswehr , said : " i am and have been fully aware of my own weaknesses .
i ask forgiveness from everyone i may have acted wrongly towards and from everyone to whom i may have caused harm . "
archbishop zollitsch met with the pope on march 12 to discuss sexual abuse against children at church institutions after german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said a " wall of silence " from the vatican was hampering probes of sexual abuse of children .
damage control on friday , mixa 's pr advisor dirk hermann voss was sacked .
voss , a trained lawyer , had described the public debate about abuse and also a finance scandal involving bishop mixa as a " media campaign against the church . "
meanwhile , the german church reform group " wir sind kirche " called for a swift decision about bishop mixa 's offer to resign. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !
theobald lost confidence and went silent .
this will partly have been the consequence of pope 's attack .
i think , however , that it was also because theobald had started to realize that this was not a single author play , but that john fletcher had had a hand in it . fletcher 's involvement would have been a tremendous embarrassment to theobald .
it 's not until fairly recently that people have recognized collaborative writing to be the standard condition of elizabethan and jacobean authorship .
more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .

but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 24.04.2010 " lost " shakespeare play shows bard did n't work alone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was common for playwrights in shakespeares time to work together we 'd like to think of shakespeare as a lone genius .
but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !
theobald lost confidence and went silent .
this will partly have been the consequence of pope 's attack .
i think , however , that it was also because theobald had started to realize that this was not a single author play , but that john fletcher had had a hand in it . fletcher 's involvement would have been a tremendous embarrassment to theobald .
it 's not until fairly recently that people have recognized collaborative writing to be the standard condition of elizabethan and jacobean authorship .
more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .
what is really exciting about the cardenio play , however , is that it is based on an episode in don quixote .
shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .
at the same time , henriques has also conceived a fancy for a country maid called violante .
so the double falsehood of the title is the betrayal of these two women by henriques and the way in which that betrayal is atoned for in the end .
it 's a tragic-comedy , really . is " double falsehood " any good ? i think the play is very good for what it is .
if judged by the standard of late shakespearean or fletcherean plays , it 's a little simple , a little stripped down .
but people will get an opportunity to judge this i hope , because i believe the royal shakespeare company is going to put it on next year .
the rsc director is a hard man to pin down , but i announced it on radio 4 , so i hope i 've committed him . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .

after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .
muscular germans hold advantage over patient french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's use of wingers like robben has been inspired bayern have grown into the champions league as the competition has progressed and have developed a winning strategy that teams considered more adept to europe have struggled to deal with .
louis van gaal has bayern playing in a very robust style where combative midfield players like mark von bommel and bastian schweinsteiger draw opponents into battle , leaving the wings free for arjen robben and franck ribery to exploit .
this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

the incumbent social democrat is favored to win , but a far-right candidate is causing controversy . barbara rosenkranz , a mother of ten who describes herself as a housewife , is only expected to receive around ten percent of the vote in the austrian presidential elections .
but even though she has next to no chance of winning , her candidacy is still causing a stir . " i think there is no doubt she is not following an agenda that is very liberal or european , " said arno behrens , a researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
the 51 year-old rosenkranz was put forward as a candidate by the far-right freedom party , founded by right-wing nationalist joerg haider .
the freedom party is staunchly anti-immigrant and opposes the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians are allowed to vote at age 16 however , analysts say rosenkranz 's success stems less from her personal political views than from an utter lack of competition .
lack of options incumbent austrian president heinz fischer was so popular in the early polls that the other major party , the right-of-center christian democrats , refused to put up a candidate of their own , creating a vacuum for conservative voters , said dr. franz fallend , a political scientist at the university of salzburg . " if the christian democrats had put up another candidate , no voters , or only very few , would consider voting for her .
but now there is no right-wing or right-of-center candidate , so there are more voters who might consider voting for barbara rosenkrantz , " fallend told deutsche welle .
behrens says this has put austrian conservatives in a difficult position .
" it 's between a far-right candidate and a socialist .
so the options for conservatives are to vote for the extreme right candidate or not vote at all , " behrens told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenkranz opposes the eu and a multi-cultural europe right-wing woes like germany , austria has struggled to come to terms with its nazi past .
however , austria has a different post-war history with de-nazification , said behrens , and this contributes to its current political situation . " austria has a problem with the right-wing , and people voting for what would , in germany , be considered an extremist right-wing party , " he said .
however , polling data show it 's almost certain that incumbent heinz fischer will be re-elected on sunday , leaving analysts hopeful that rosenkranz 's candidacy will remain a problem of austria 's past , rather than its future .

the incumbent social democrat is favored to win , but a far-right candidate is causing controversy . barbara rosenkranz , a mother of ten who describes herself as a housewife , is only expected to receive around ten percent of the vote in the austrian presidential elections .
but even though she has next to no chance of winning , her candidacy is still causing a stir . " i think there is no doubt she is not following an agenda that is very liberal or european , " said arno behrens , a researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
the 51 year-old rosenkranz was put forward as a candidate by the far-right freedom party , founded by right-wing nationalist joerg haider .
the freedom party is staunchly anti-immigrant and opposes the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians are allowed to vote at age 16 however , analysts say rosenkranz 's success stems less from her personal political views than from an utter lack of competition .
lack of options incumbent austrian president heinz fischer was so popular in the early polls that the other major party , the right-of-center christian democrats , refused to put up a candidate of their own , creating a vacuum for conservative voters , said dr. franz fallend , a political scientist at the university of salzburg . " if the christian democrats had put up another candidate , no voters , or only very few , would consider voting for her .
but now there is no right-wing or right-of-center candidate , so there are more voters who might consider voting for barbara rosenkrantz , " fallend told deutsche welle .
behrens says this has put austrian conservatives in a difficult position .
" it 's between a far-right candidate and a socialist .
so the options for conservatives are to vote for the extreme right candidate or not vote at all , " behrens told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenkranz opposes the eu and a multi-cultural europe right-wing woes like germany , austria has struggled to come to terms with its nazi past .
however , austria has a different post-war history with de-nazification , said behrens , and this contributes to its current political situation . " austria has a problem with the right-wing , and people voting for what would , in germany , be considered an extremist right-wing party , " he said .
however , polling data show it 's almost certain that incumbent heinz fischer will be re-elected on sunday , leaving analysts hopeful that rosenkranz 's candidacy will remain a problem of austria 's past , rather than its future .

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .

" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack . "

i ask forgiveness from everyone i may have acted wrongly towards and from everyone to whom i may have caused harm . "

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .

"
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack . "

i ask forgiveness from everyone i may have acted wrongly towards and from everyone to whom i may have caused harm . "
archbishop zollitsch met with the pope on march 12 to discuss sexual abuse against children at church institutions after german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said a " wall of silence " from the vatican was hampering probes of sexual abuse of children .

voss , a trained lawyer , had described the public debate about abuse and also a finance scandal involving bishop mixa as a " media campaign against the church . "

" there 's still time to avoid the worst , " he said on belgian television on friday , urging all parties to return to the negotiating table .
the issues in brussels have sparked a bitter row among the five flemish and francophone parties that formed the government until the flemish liberal party open vld quit the coalition last thursday , prompting prime minister yves leterme to hand in his resignation on the same day .
crisis could weaken belgium 's eu presidency the latest crisis comes just two months before belgium takes over the rotating presidency of the european union .
king albert ii , who has not yet accepted leterme 's resignation , is keen to solve the crisis without holding snap elections before july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme 's resignation has not yet been accepted by king albert ii the head of open vld , alexander de croo , reiterated on saturday that his party wants a solution to the brussels problem by next thursday .
if no solution is found , the flemish parties , which dominate the governing coalition , have threatened to split bhv without reference to french speakers .
row over rights of francophone belgians at the heart of the feud between belgium 's parties is the ongoing debate about the rights of francophone residents in and around the capital brussels .
french speakers are in the minority in brussels , which lies in the flemish region of flanders .
the governing coalition has so far been unable to find a way to divide the brussels electoral district in a way that satisfies both flemish and francophone residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels is home to around 100,000 french speakers reynders ' appointment is seen as a shrewd move by king albert ii , as reynders is also the head of the liberal francophone party parte mouvement reparateur -lrb- mr -rrb- , which is seen as the most vocal of the french-language parties in the government .
the coalition , which was only formed five months ago , consists of the flemish and francophone christian democrat parties , the flemish and francophone liberal parties and the francophone socialist party .
recent proposals by former prime minister jean-luc dehaene had failed to solve the issue , with francophone parties unhappy with the rights envisaged in dehaene 's plans. ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german chancellor merkel says the greek government must satisfy " very stringent conditions " for aid before germany loosens its purse strings . german chancellor angela merkel , whose government has been reluctant to help greece , declared that the eu-imf rescue package would be activated only if the stability of the euro was threatened and athens implemented tough cost-cutting policies .
merkel insisted that greece " must play its part in ensuring that greece 's finances return to a solid path ...
the stability of our currency is the first priority . "
the greek government must negotiate a “ credible savings program ” with the european commission and the international monetary fund , merkel said .
the imf , the commission and the european central bank have to determine “ whether an aid program for greece is needed for the euro ’ s stability . ”
“ only when those two conditions are met can we talk about specific aid , including the kind of aid and the amount , ” merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou announced the decision to request the joint eu-imf rescue plan from the remote island of kastellorizo the chancellor 's comments came after the eu said it did not see any " obstacles " and would react in a " rapid " manner to the request to activate a three-year debt rescue package worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in the first year .
athens is seeking the loan at concessionary interest rates of about five percent .
three-year aid plan under the three-year plan agreed to in brussels on march 25 , the imf will provide about ten billion euros in 2010 , while eurozone nations have pledged 30 billion euros .
athens needs to raise about 11 billion euros to service its debt by may 19 .
the government is believed to have only some two billion euros left in its coffers .
the precise details of the rescue plan are still being negotiated , but it is expected that greece will receive aid from the imf first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the stability of the euro is the first priority amid the aid debate " greece is expecting 12 billion euros from the imf at an interest rate of 2.64 percent .
that is less than half the interest that greece would pay on international markets .
this would probably cover greece 's needs for the upcoming weeks , " said deutsche welle correspondent jannis papadimitriou in athens .
imf to move swiftly international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said the fund would " move expeditiously . "
however , he warned that greece was in for a hard time and that the money was no handout .
" the effort to be made by the greeks is huge , " strauss-kahn added .
" they have to understand that we are not punishing them for any kind of sin , we tried to help them to go back on track .
and it will be very difficult , very long and very painful and it 's in the interest of nobody to try and hide this reality . "
meanwhile , at the imf and world bank meeting in washington , us treasury secretary timothy geithner urged the eu to roll out the bail-out and pressed greece to implement reforms .
germany wants rigorous controls the money pledged by eu nations , however , could take some time to come .
germany , as europe 's largest economy , would be expected to provide about 8.4 billion euros .
chancellor angela merkel faces strong public opposition to aid for greece ahead of a key regional election on may 9 in which the center-right government 's upper house majority is at stake .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble also warned against granting greece financial assistance too hastily . schaeuble stressed that greece must return to sound financial conditions , saying that in the case of renewed violations of the austerity program there would be no more aid .
the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens demanded that the banks be involved in the aid package .
spd leader sigmar gabriel said the chancellor should not be allowed to spend taxpayers ' money without calling for the participation of german banks , which he said had also speculated in a big way in greece .
the greens also insisted that merkel should try to get private creditors on board .
even among merkel 's coalition partners , the free democrats , some doubt whether the bail-out is at all necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks have been taking to the streets to protest the government 's harsh austerity measures the association of german taxpayers meanwhile said the financial assistance was " a bitter pill for german taxpayers to swallow . "
but the manager of the association , reiner holznagel , added that the choice was between " plague and cholera . "
if greece went bankrupt , there would be far worse consequences , he said .
unprecedented crisis the greek debt drama has grown into the biggest crisis since the euro was adopted , sparking concerns that it could spread to other weak members of the single currency area .
athens ' credibility was severely undermined by a series of statements showing that it has misreported key data for the eurozone since it joined in 2001 .
the country has an overall public debt of about 300 billion euros and its public deficit is more than four times eu norms .
the imf 's involvement would also be a first for the eurozone .
it has already helped out other european union members like hungary but the eurozone 's rules are supposed to be enforced by the european central bank and member states .
critics have suggested that such an imf role now undermines the credibility of the eurozone. rb / ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vatican said pope benedict xvi had accepted the resignation .
the 73-year-old is the first bishop to resign in belgium since the wave of scandals involving priests first hit the headlines in november 2009 .
with congregations leaving the church in their droves and a decreasing number of belgians wanting to join the clergy , the pope is facing growing pressure over his handling of alleged crimes involving pedophile priests .
heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .

"
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .
however , the vatican dismissed a lawsuit accusing it and pope benedict xvi of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the united states .
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " vatican lawyer jeffrey lena said friday .
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack . "
the jury 's out on german bishop meanwhile , germany is grappling with a scandal involving one of the country 's most divisive bishops , walter mixa of augsburg .
he has admitted to hitting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archbishop of augsburg , walter mixa , at first denied allegations of physical abuse the head of the german church , robert zollitsch had asked mixa to " take a break " - an unprecedented move , according to german media . in a letter to the german-born pope benedict , bishop mixa , who is also military chaplain to the german bundeswehr , said : " i am and have been fully aware of my own weaknesses .
i ask forgiveness from everyone i may have acted wrongly towards and from everyone to whom i may have caused harm . "
archbishop zollitsch met with the pope on march 12 to discuss sexual abuse against children at church institutions after german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said a " wall of silence " from the vatican was hampering probes of sexual abuse of children .
damage control on friday , mixa 's pr advisor dirk hermann voss was sacked .
voss , a trained lawyer , had described the public debate about abuse and also a finance scandal involving bishop mixa as a " media campaign against the church . "
meanwhile , the german church reform group " wir sind kirche " called for a swift decision about bishop mixa 's offer to resign. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

heads roll as irish scandal widens friday 's announcement followed the resignation of another bishop in ireland , 73-year-old james moriarty , a day earlier .
moriarty was named in a damning report that found catholic authorities in the dublin archdiocese concealed abuse of children by priests for decades .
moriarty was the fourth bishop to be allowed to resign over the scandals in ireland .
there are also mounting calls for the country 's top prelate , cardinal sean brady , to leave because of his handling of the case .

"
the head of the belgian catholic church , andre-joseph leonard , in comments relayed by the vatican press office , noted that the pope had " immediately accepted " vangheluwe 's resignation .
" in this way the church is underscoring that in these affairs there is no beating around the bush , " said andre-joseph leonard , archbishop of mechelen-brussels .

but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !
theobald lost confidence and went silent .
this will partly have been the consequence of pope 's attack .
i think , however , that it was also because theobald had started to realize that this was not a single author play , but that john fletcher had had a hand in it . fletcher 's involvement would have been a tremendous embarrassment to theobald .
it 's not until fairly recently that people have recognized collaborative writing to be the standard condition of elizabethan and jacobean authorship .
more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .
what is really exciting about the cardenio play , however , is that it is based on an episode in don quixote .
shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .
at the same time , henriques has also conceived a fancy for a country maid called violante .
so the double falsehood of the title is the betrayal of these two women by henriques and the way in which that betrayal is atoned for in the end .
it 's a tragic-comedy , really . is " double falsehood " any good ? i think the play is very good for what it is .
if judged by the standard of late shakespearean or fletcherean plays , it 's a little simple , a little stripped down .
but people will get an opportunity to judge this i hope , because i believe the royal shakespeare company is going to put it on next year .
the rsc director is a hard man to pin down , but i announced it on radio 4 , so i hope i 've committed him . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !
theobald lost confidence and went silent .
this will partly have been the consequence of pope 's attack .
i think , however , that it was also because theobald had started to realize that this was not a single author play , but that john fletcher had had a hand in it . fletcher 's involvement would have been a tremendous embarrassment to theobald .
it 's not until fairly recently that people have recognized collaborative writing to be the standard condition of elizabethan and jacobean authorship .
more than half of the plays written in the period were written collaboratively . this is not the story we have wanted to tell about shakespeare .
we have wanted to think of shakespeare as a lone universal genius .
but in actual fact , shakespeare was a jobbing playwright , he wrote for the market place and he collaborated with other writers when it was sensible for him to do that . so we 're talking about a play which shakespeare wrote in collaboration with fletcher , and which was then edited by theobald in the eighteenth century .
how much shakespeare is there in there ? i like to think of it as a layer cake .
there 's a layer of shakespeare at the bottom of this , but there 's a layer of 18th-century adaptation on top .
the meter is very smooth - perhaps too smooth .
then there 's the fact that there is no sub-plot .
there is no diversification of the action .
shakespeare 's later plays are typically complicated .
there will be a sub-plot .
we do n't have that here .
one 's suspicion has to be that it was there once , and that it was then taken out in conformity with 18th-century tastes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern reconstruction of shakespeare 's globe theatre opened in 1997 what does the addition of " double falsehood " to the canon add to our knowledge of shakespeare ? it adds to our understanding of this notion of collaboration , of shakespeare working with other writers .
what is really exciting about the cardenio play , however , is that it is based on an episode in don quixote .
shakespeare meets cervantes !
you think of the huge genius of the english renaissance meeting the huge genius of the spanish renaissance under the covers of one play .
of course , there 's also the fact that cervantes died on the same day as shakespeare , which i 've always rather liked ! can you outline the basic plot of the play for us ? there is a character called julio who is betrothed to leonora , but julio 's friend henriques decides that he wants to steal leonora .
at the same time , henriques has also conceived a fancy for a country maid called violante .
so the double falsehood of the title is the betrayal of these two women by henriques and the way in which that betrayal is atoned for in the end .
it 's a tragic-comedy , really . is " double falsehood " any good ? i think the play is very good for what it is .
if judged by the standard of late shakespearean or fletcherean plays , it 's a little simple , a little stripped down .
but people will get an opportunity to judge this i hope , because i believe the royal shakespeare company is going to put it on next year .
the rsc director is a hard man to pin down , but i announced it on radio 4 , so i hope i 've committed him . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .

this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

with four nations involved in the semi-finals , the competition celebrates a range of differences . do you remember the days when the champions league used to feature the champions of europe and no one else ?
if it seems a long time ago , that 's because it is .
before uefa got the money-spinning bug in 1992 when it opened up the old european cup to all and sundry , the competition was truly the domain of champions .
the winners of the european leagues would be drawn out of a tatty top hat and forced to meet in two-legged knock-out ties all over the continent which would ultimately end in a single , final game .
there were no qualifying rounds – because winning your league was qualification enough , there were no group stages , and while there was plenty of prestige , there was little glitz and glamour .
to be honest , it was a bit dull .
the slowly turning wheel of soccer destiny often brings certain clubs to the fore in their domestic leagues and keeps them at the top for periods known as ' halcyon days . '
in the old days , a club which had the measure of its domestic opponents could win a decade of championship titles without worrying too much about getting unseated by their nearest rival .
before soccer became drowned in cash , opposing teams would have to wait until the best team in the league lost their players through age before they could take their turn at the top .
this meant the european cup almost always featured the same teams – for what seemed like centuries .
a combination of prestige and unpredictability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern helped to end england 's grip on the champions league the champions league was brought in to do away with all that .
giving qualification places to any team which could limp their way to fourth made it possible – in theory at least – for all manner of ambitious clubs to become european champions .
in return for this new exciting paradigm , the top teams were given even more money – which , until this season , meant that the champions league just became a flashier version of the competition it had been brought in to replace .
thankfully , the 2009/10 champions league campaign has begun to restore faith in the original concept of a competition which was designed to find and honor the best team in europe .
instead of being an extension of the english premiership , as the latter stages have appeared to be over the last five years , the champions league semi-finals this season feature a struggle for dominance between clubs from four different countries , playing four very different styles of soccer .
this season has been the first really successful example of combining the prestige of the past format with the unpredictability of the present .
some may argue that this unpredictability is tempered slightly , due to barcelona 's continued involvement .
the reigning european champions , who are attempting to become the first team to retain the trophy since ac milan in 1990 , are hardly strangers to the business end of the competition as befits a team which , if not the best , is arguably the most attractive to watch in europe at the moment .
artistic barca undone by pragmatic inter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art and graft : inter doubled up to negate the threat of messi however , for all their attacking flair , their destructive passing and the irrepressible genius of leo messi , barcelona trail inter milan 3-1 in their semi-final .
after majestically blowing arsenal away in the quarter-finals with an offensive display which was breath-taking even by their standards , barca was not expected to lose so heavily to jose mourinho 's milanese pragmatists .
if barcelona could dismantle the most creative team in england , they could surely play their way through one of the most obstinate .
inter milan have been accused of playing a type of anti-football under mourinho which , considering the tradition of catenaccio in italian soccer , is quite an insult .
it 's true that inter 's portuguese coach values victory over style but it is also true that mourinho has a talent for working out how to beat teams .
against barcelona this week , inter milan were supremely organized – as one would expect from an italian side – but even after going a goal behind , inter continued to smother barca , negate messi 's threat and hit three valuable goals once the catalans had been frustrated out of their rhythm .
one has to wonder how bayern munich or olympique lyon will fare against either team in the final .
muscular germans hold advantage over patient french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's use of wingers like robben has been inspired bayern have grown into the champions league as the competition has progressed and have developed a winning strategy that teams considered more adept to europe have struggled to deal with .
louis van gaal has bayern playing in a very robust style where combative midfield players like mark von bommel and bastian schweinsteiger draw opponents into battle , leaving the wings free for arjen robben and franck ribery to exploit .
this powerful approach has snuffed out more creative threats and has exposed defensive frailties to bayern 's advantage .
lyon have finally made it to the semis in europe after three previous quarter-final appearances , perversely at the same time that their era of dominance in the french league has come to an end .
under claude puel , lyon have become an effective counter-attacking team in europe , as the likes of liverpool , real madrid and bordeaux can attest to .
lyon 's competent defence , backed by the outstanding hugo lloris in goal , have negated flair teams , leaving the front line of lisandro lopez , miralem pjanic and cesar delgado free to hit teams on the break .
with barcelona 's artistry , inter milan 's pressure game , bayern 's muscularity and lyon 's patience , this year 's champions league is exactly what it should be : a clash of differing styles , diverse tactics and pan-european attitudes .
whoever wins the title this year will be able to say that they beat the best in europe – and not just a bunch of teams from their own league .

" there 's still time to avoid the worst , " he said on belgian television on friday , urging all parties to return to the negotiating table .
the issues in brussels have sparked a bitter row among the five flemish and francophone parties that formed the government until the flemish liberal party open vld quit the coalition last thursday , prompting prime minister yves leterme to hand in his resignation on the same day .
crisis could weaken belgium 's eu presidency the latest crisis comes just two months before belgium takes over the rotating presidency of the european union .
king albert ii , who has not yet accepted leterme 's resignation , is keen to solve the crisis without holding snap elections before july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme 's resignation has not yet been accepted by king albert ii the head of open vld , alexander de croo , reiterated on saturday that his party wants a solution to the brussels problem by next thursday .
if no solution is found , the flemish parties , which dominate the governing coalition , have threatened to split bhv without reference to french speakers .
row over rights of francophone belgians at the heart of the feud between belgium 's parties is the ongoing debate about the rights of francophone residents in and around the capital brussels .
french speakers are in the minority in brussels , which lies in the flemish region of flanders .
the governing coalition has so far been unable to find a way to divide the brussels electoral district in a way that satisfies both flemish and francophone residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels is home to around 100,000 french speakers reynders ' appointment is seen as a shrewd move by king albert ii , as reynders is also the head of the liberal francophone party parte mouvement reparateur -lrb- mr -rrb- , which is seen as the most vocal of the french-language parties in the government .
the coalition , which was only formed five months ago , consists of the flemish and francophone christian democrat parties , the flemish and francophone liberal parties and the francophone socialist party .
recent proposals by former prime minister jean-luc dehaene had failed to solve the issue , with francophone parties unhappy with the rights envisaged in dehaene 's plans. ng / afp / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incumbent social democrat is favored to win , but a far-right candidate is causing controversy . barbara rosenkranz , a mother of ten who describes herself as a housewife , is only expected to receive around ten percent of the vote in the austrian presidential elections .
but even though she has next to no chance of winning , her candidacy is still causing a stir . " i think there is no doubt she is not following an agenda that is very liberal or european , " said arno behrens , a researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
the 51 year-old rosenkranz was put forward as a candidate by the far-right freedom party , founded by right-wing nationalist joerg haider .
the freedom party is staunchly anti-immigrant and opposes the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians are allowed to vote at age 16 however , analysts say rosenkranz 's success stems less from her personal political views than from an utter lack of competition .
lack of options incumbent austrian president heinz fischer was so popular in the early polls that the other major party , the right-of-center christian democrats , refused to put up a candidate of their own , creating a vacuum for conservative voters , said dr. franz fallend , a political scientist at the university of salzburg . " if the christian democrats had put up another candidate , no voters , or only very few , would consider voting for her .
but now there is no right-wing or right-of-center candidate , so there are more voters who might consider voting for barbara rosenkrantz , " fallend told deutsche welle .
behrens says this has put austrian conservatives in a difficult position .
" it 's between a far-right candidate and a socialist .
so the options for conservatives are to vote for the extreme right candidate or not vote at all , " behrens told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenkranz opposes the eu and a multi-cultural europe right-wing woes like germany , austria has struggled to come to terms with its nazi past .
however , austria has a different post-war history with de-nazification , said behrens , and this contributes to its current political situation . " austria has a problem with the right-wing , and people voting for what would , in germany , be considered an extremist right-wing party , " he said .
however , polling data show it 's almost certain that incumbent heinz fischer will be re-elected on sunday , leaving analysts hopeful that rosenkranz 's candidacy will remain a problem of austria 's past , rather than its future .

the incumbent social democrat is favored to win , but a far-right candidate is causing controversy . barbara rosenkranz , a mother of ten who describes herself as a housewife , is only expected to receive around ten percent of the vote in the austrian presidential elections .
but even though she has next to no chance of winning , her candidacy is still causing a stir . " i think there is no doubt she is not following an agenda that is very liberal or european , " said arno behrens , a researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
the 51 year-old rosenkranz was put forward as a candidate by the far-right freedom party , founded by right-wing nationalist joerg haider .
the freedom party is staunchly anti-immigrant and opposes the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 24.04.2010 " lost " shakespeare play shows bard did n't work alone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was common for playwrights in shakespeares time to work together we 'd like to think of shakespeare as a lone genius .
but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .

but new research indicates he co-authored a play that had long been attributed to someone else .
dw-world.de spoke with the editor of the newly published work . for almost 300 years , the play " double falsehood " was regarded as a hoax .
in the 18th century , the editor lewis theobald had presented the work as an adaptation of cardenio , a lost play by william shakespeare , but it was dismissed as a fraud .
new research , however , indicates that " double falsehood " was indeed co-authored by the bard , together with contemporary playright john fletcher . brean hammond has edited " double falsehood " for inclusion in the renowned arden shakespeare collection .
through his research , hammond has established a direct lineage between " double falsehood " and the lost shakespeare play , " cardenio . "
deutsche welle : professor hammond .
can you tell us how you came to encounter " double falsehood ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet alexander pope led hammond to evidence behind shakespeare 's " double falsehood " brean hammond : i initially discovered “ double falsehood ” in the 1980s , when i was working on -lsb- 18th-century english poet -rsb- alexander pope .
pope was the big cultural magnate of the period .
he got himself into a feud with lewis theobald , an up-and-coming scholar who had demolished pope 's edition of hamlet .
so pope - not a man to take such things lying down - wrote a massive mock epic poem called " the dunciad , " making theobald the king of the dunces . another part of this process of pouring cold water on theobald was to rubbish a play that theobald had advanced as a lost play by shakespeare .
that play was " double falsehood . "
pope writes long and abrasive footnotes suggesting that this play is claptrap or forgery . but what is fascinating about these footnotes - and what really got me going - is that as pope was rubbishing theobald 's lines , he started to find iambic pentameters buried in there that theobald had n't spotted .
theobald had actually presented lines as prose that pope could see were poetry .
pope found himself inadvertently editing the play ! whatever he may privately have come to believe about the origins of the play , pope 's public verdict was that theobald 's claim was an elaborate hoax .
this has been the generally accepted opinion ever since . well , that never seemed to me to be at all convincing .
it was n't convincing as a description of the play we had , and it was n't convincing as an account of what theobald might do .
far too risky .
theobald would never have forged a play and passed it off as shakespeare if he wanted a successful career as a shakespeare editor .
that would have been suicidal . taking on pope proved rather suicidal … yes , it was never easy to take on pope .
pope may have been only four-feet-seven-inches tall , but he packed a terrible wallop !

the march comes a day after armenia said it was halting ratification of a historic reconciliation accord with turkey that would have normalized ties after decades of hostility over the killings .

in saturday 's edition of turkish newspaper hurriyet , an opinion piece acknowledged that ankara had made ' mistakes ' in the handling of events that led to the enormous suffering of the armenian people in 1915 .
