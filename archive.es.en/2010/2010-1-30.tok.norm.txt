scientists say this could cause an earthquake even more destructive than the one which shocked haiti three weeks ago . around 14 million people live in istanbul , the city that literally bridges two continents over the bosphorus , a strait between the european and asian part of turkey . according to ahmet ercan , head of the turkish geophysical society , the next massive earthquake to occur in the region will have an epicenter in the sea of marmara - around 25 kilometers -lrb- 15 miles -rrb- south of istanbul - at a depth between 7 and 10 kilometers -lrb- 11-16 miles -rrb- . the tremor could result in a tsunami as well . though ercan said the potential was not likely exceed 6.7 on the richter scale , he warned that istanbul 's " particular geological makeup could enhance the power of the quake to somewhere between 7.0 and 8.0 , " with a radius of up to 90 kilometers . the january 12 quake in haiti has made it clear what an earthquake can mean for a large city like istanbul .
but this is a danger many turkish citizens already know too well . in 1999 , a 7.4-magnitude quake hit the city of izmit , which straddles essentially the same fault as istanbul .
according to official figures , the disaster killed over 18,000 people - over 10 percent of the population . bildunterschrift : over 10 percent of the population perished in an earthquake in izmit on the sea of marmara there have been 15 massive earthquakes recorded in istanbul since the fourth century , evidence enough that the city can not afford to neglect the risks of a future earthquake . construction issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : precious architecture or potential danger ?
the united nations recently published a study looking into earthquake mortality risks among the world 's largest cities .
scientists found that more people would be at risk of losing their life if a massive earthquake were to strike istanbul than any other city in the world . city officials say the deteriorating quality of istanbul 's buildings is partly to blame for the high risk citizens face . the city is looking to rip down dilapidated structures and construct new buildings , but this has proved more difficult than expected . " there are so many rules and laws here ; it makes it almost impossible to accomplish anything , " said hasan atas , a city official .
" the entire city is full of dilapidated buildings that ca n't be torn down because they are protected by law . " pure chaos according to segal sengor , a leading geophysicist at istanbul 's technical university , a massive earthquake would essentially destroy istanbul : buildings would implode and most people would get buried under the rubble . " underneath the majority of the streets , there are pipelines that will most likely burst , and there will be fires , " sengor said .
" the people will all attempt to flee : it will be a scenario of utter catastrophe and pure chaos . " bildunterschrift : leading geophysicists are aware of the dangers istanbul 's 14 million people face the city says it is taking measures to protect the metropolis and its inhabitants from the dangers of an earthquake .

the school 's director has strongly criticised the church for turning a blind eye and warns of new cases . police are investigating allegations that teachers at an elite private school in berlin sexually abused pupils during the late 1970s and early 1980s .
one suspect has admitted to his guilt in an open letter to the news magazine spiegel . five former students , all male , at the jesuit canisius college had initially notified the institution 's director , klaus mertes , of the abuse .
two teachers - both jesuit priests who no longer work at the school - had been identified by their accusers , who would have been aged 13-17 at the time , mertes said . one of the men accused , a former sports teacher has already admitted to the abuse according to news magazine spiegel .
according to the magazine , he had written an open letter to be published apologizing to his victims , which stated that he had abused children and teenagers for many years . " i am sorry for what i have done to you .
if you are able to forgive me for this , i ask you to do so , " he wrote the second suspect - a former religious studies teacher - reportedly denied the charges .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child abuse is not just an issue for the churches in the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag , mertes said the catholic church had to take measures to make sure such abuse did not happen again . " although the now well-known abuse happened a long time ago , the danger of new instances of abuse could not be ruled out , ” he said . mertes added that the church 's attitude to homosexuality was not helpful .
" the church suffers from homophobia , " he said . " homosexuality is hidden .
clerics with this inclination are not sure that they will be accepted if they are honest about their sexuality . ” it was unsurprising that the revelations came so late , mertes had said on friday .

the school 's director has strongly criticised the church for turning a blind eye and warns of new cases . police are investigating allegations that teachers at an elite private school in berlin sexually abused pupils during the late 1970s and early 1980s .
one suspect has admitted to his guilt in an open letter to the news magazine spiegel . five former students , all male , at the jesuit canisius college had initially notified the institution 's director , klaus mertes , of the abuse .
two teachers - both jesuit priests who no longer work at the school - had been identified by their accusers , who would have been aged 13-17 at the time , mertes said . one of the men accused , a former sports teacher has already admitted to the abuse according to news magazine spiegel .
according to the magazine , he had written an open letter to be published apologizing to his victims , which stated that he had abused children and teenagers for many years . " i am sorry for what i have done to you .
if you are able to forgive me for this , i ask you to do so , " he wrote the second suspect - a former religious studies teacher - reportedly denied the charges . ' danger of new instances ' the original accusations prompted mertes to send a letter to 500 alumni , encouraging them to write in about their own experiences at the time .
replies from ex-students continued to arrive , he said , with the number of people claiming to have been abused reaching 20 by friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child abuse is not just an issue for the churches in the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag , mertes said the catholic church had to take measures to make sure such abuse did not happen again . " although the now well-known abuse happened a long time ago , the danger of new instances of abuse could not be ruled out , ” he said . mertes added that the church 's attitude to homosexuality was not helpful .
" the church suffers from homophobia , " he said . " homosexuality is hidden .
clerics with this inclination are not sure that they will be accepted if they are honest about their sexuality . ” it was unsurprising that the revelations came so late , mertes had said on friday .
" everyone who has dealt with sexual abuse cases knows very well that there 's a lot of shame and pain involved on the part of the victims , " mertes told reporters . " and it often takes many decades until those affected are able to get their trauma under control and are willing to speak about it openly . " he said that the scandal could not have remained undetected at the time , had a number of people in responsible positions not looked the other way . most of the cases would likely be difficult to prosecute because german law limits the statute of limitations on sexual abuse to 10 years after the victim has turned 18 , mertes said. rc / dpa / afp / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so far , efforts to generate clean nuclear power using a process that would leave no toxic radioactive waste have proved elusive . german chancellor angela merkel called for nuclear fusion to be explored as a solution to the world 's energy needs .
merkel said ploughing money into developing the energy form , which it is believed would produce no toxic radioactive waste , would be a good investment .
" nuclear fusion would be a form of energy that could provide an infinite amount of energy for us , " said merkel in her weekly video message on saturday .
joining , not splitting current nuclear energy production uses a process known as fission , which exploits the energy released when heavy atoms are split into smaller ones .
nuclear fusion , the energy source of the sun and other stars , involves joining together smaller atoms that release energy when they are fused .
" we want to bring the type of energy that the sun produces to earth , " said merkel , a former physicist .

she said the search for viable fusion was " worth investing in " and would need international cooperation .
the chancellor added that scientific and technological research should be an economic priority as germany recovers from recession .

the school 's director has strongly criticised the church for turning a blind eye and warns of new cases . police are investigating allegations that teachers at an elite private school in berlin sexually abused pupils during the late 1970s and early 1980s .
one suspect has admitted to his guilt in an open letter to the news magazine spiegel . five former students , all male , at the jesuit canisius college had initially notified the institution 's director , klaus mertes , of the abuse .
two teachers - both jesuit priests who no longer work at the school - had been identified by their accusers , who would have been aged 13-17 at the time , mertes said . one of the men accused , a former sports teacher has already admitted to the abuse according to news magazine spiegel .
according to the magazine , he had written an open letter to be published apologizing to his victims , which stated that he had abused children and teenagers for many years . " i am sorry for what i have done to you .
if you are able to forgive me for this , i ask you to do so , " he wrote the second suspect - a former religious studies teacher - reportedly denied the charges . ' danger of new instances ' the original accusations prompted mertes to send a letter to 500 alumni , encouraging them to write in about their own experiences at the time .
replies from ex-students continued to arrive , he said , with the number of people claiming to have been abused reaching 20 by friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child abuse is not just an issue for the churches in the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag , mertes said the catholic church had to take measures to make sure such abuse did not happen again . " although the now well-known abuse happened a long time ago , the danger of new instances of abuse could not be ruled out , ” he said . mertes added that the church 's attitude to homosexuality was not helpful .
" the church suffers from homophobia , " he said . " homosexuality is hidden .
clerics with this inclination are not sure that they will be accepted if they are honest about their sexuality . ” it was unsurprising that the revelations came so late , mertes had said on friday .
" everyone who has dealt with sexual abuse cases knows very well that there 's a lot of shame and pain involved on the part of the victims , " mertes told reporters . " and it often takes many decades until those affected are able to get their trauma under control and are willing to speak about it openly . " he said that the scandal could not have remained undetected at the time , had a number of people in responsible positions not looked the other way . most of the cases would likely be difficult to prosecute because german law limits the statute of limitations on sexual abuse to 10 years after the victim has turned 18 , mertes said. rc / dpa / afp / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the school 's director has strongly criticised the church for turning a blind eye and warns of new cases . police are investigating allegations that teachers at an elite private school in berlin sexually abused pupils during the late 1970s and early 1980s .
one suspect has admitted to his guilt in an open letter to the news magazine spiegel . five former students , all male , at the jesuit canisius college had initially notified the institution 's director , klaus mertes , of the abuse .
two teachers - both jesuit priests who no longer work at the school - had been identified by their accusers , who would have been aged 13-17 at the time , mertes said . one of the men accused , a former sports teacher has already admitted to the abuse according to news magazine spiegel .
according to the magazine , he had written an open letter to be published apologizing to his victims , which stated that he had abused children and teenagers for many years . " i am sorry for what i have done to you .
if you are able to forgive me for this , i ask you to do so , " he wrote the second suspect - a former religious studies teacher - reportedly denied the charges .

" he said that the scandal could not have remained undetected at the time , had a number of people in responsible positions not looked the other way . most of the cases would likely be difficult to prosecute because german law limits the statute of limitations on sexual abuse to 10 years after the victim has turned 18 , mertes said. rc / dpa / afp / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scientists say this could cause an earthquake even more destructive than the one which shocked haiti three weeks ago . around 14 million people live in istanbul , the city that literally bridges two continents over the bosphorus , a strait between the european and asian part of turkey . according to ahmet ercan , head of the turkish geophysical society , the next massive earthquake to occur in the region will have an epicenter in the sea of marmara - around 25 kilometers -lrb- 15 miles -rrb- south of istanbul - at a depth between 7 and 10 kilometers -lrb- 11-16 miles -rrb- . the tremor could result in a tsunami as well . though ercan said the potential was not likely exceed 6.7 on the richter scale , he warned that istanbul 's " particular geological makeup could enhance the power of the quake to somewhere between 7.0 and 8.0 , " with a radius of up to 90 kilometers . the january 12 quake in haiti has made it clear what an earthquake can mean for a large city like istanbul .
but this is a danger many turkish citizens already know too well . in 1999 , a 7.4-magnitude quake hit the city of izmit , which straddles essentially the same fault as istanbul .
according to official figures , the disaster killed over 18,000 people - over 10 percent of the population . bildunterschrift : over 10 percent of the population perished in an earthquake in izmit on the sea of marmara there have been 15 massive earthquakes recorded in istanbul since the fourth century , evidence enough that the city can not afford to neglect the risks of a future earthquake . construction issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : precious architecture or potential danger ?
the united nations recently published a study looking into earthquake mortality risks among the world 's largest cities .
scientists found that more people would be at risk of losing their life if a massive earthquake were to strike istanbul than any other city in the world . city officials say the deteriorating quality of istanbul 's buildings is partly to blame for the high risk citizens face . the city is looking to rip down dilapidated structures and construct new buildings , but this has proved more difficult than expected . " there are so many rules and laws here ; it makes it almost impossible to accomplish anything , " said hasan atas , a city official .
" the entire city is full of dilapidated buildings that ca n't be torn down because they are protected by law . " pure chaos according to segal sengor , a leading geophysicist at istanbul 's technical university , a massive earthquake would essentially destroy istanbul : buildings would implode and most people would get buried under the rubble . " underneath the majority of the streets , there are pipelines that will most likely burst , and there will be fires , " sengor said .
" the people will all attempt to flee : it will be a scenario of utter catastrophe and pure chaos . " bildunterschrift : leading geophysicists are aware of the dangers istanbul 's 14 million people face the city says it is taking measures to protect the metropolis and its inhabitants from the dangers of an earthquake .

so far , efforts to generate clean nuclear power using a process that would leave no toxic radioactive waste have proved elusive . german chancellor angela merkel called for nuclear fusion to be explored as a solution to the world 's energy needs .
merkel said ploughing money into developing the energy form , which it is believed would produce no toxic radioactive waste , would be a good investment .
" nuclear fusion would be a form of energy that could provide an infinite amount of energy for us , " said merkel in her weekly video message on saturday .
joining , not splitting current nuclear energy production uses a process known as fission , which exploits the energy released when heavy atoms are split into smaller ones .
nuclear fusion , the energy source of the sun and other stars , involves joining together smaller atoms that release energy when they are fused .
" we want to bring the type of energy that the sun produces to earth , " said merkel , a former physicist .
on monday , the chancellor will visit the max planck institute for plasma physics in greifswald where fusion research is being conducted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor will visit german researchers investigating the energy source she said that nuclear fusion , along with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power , was a " future technology " worth investing in .
research into fusion has not been successful so far , requiring more power to be used than can be extracted .
a good opportunity despite this , merkel said a replacement for diminishing fossil fuel supplies was needed .
she said the search for viable fusion was " worth investing in " and would need international cooperation .
the chancellor added that scientific and technological research should be an economic priority as germany recovers from recession .
" without research , without investment in the future , we will not be able to maintain our prosperity , " she said. rc / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
