the plan was proposed at a un meeting in new york . israel denounced the planned meeting which is backed by nearly 200 nations , signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
" this resolution is deeply flawed and hypocritical , " netanyahu said during a visit to toronto , canada , on saturday .
" it ignores the realities of the middle east and the real threats facing the region and the entire world , " he insisted .
israel singled out his comments came after an agreement reached on friday at the 2010 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- ntp -rrb- review conference in new york , which calls for the conference on a nuclear-free middle east .
some 189 nations agreed to the 28-page document following a month-long conference on strengthening the npt .

" it singles out israel , the middle east 's only true democracy and the only country threatened with annihilation , " netanyahu said .
the npt treaty did not mention other nuclear powers that have not signed up to the non-proliferation treaty , such as india and pakistan . netanyahu has the backing of us president barack obama , who said on friday that " we -lsb- the us -rsb- strongly oppose actions that jeopardize israel 's national security .

it was the first agreement in 10 years on the npt , which has set the global agenda for fighting the spread of nuclear weapons since 1970 .

the goal tally could have been higher , and a number of players showed themselves well . germany won a comfortable 3-0 victory against hungary as brazilian-born cacau scored his third goal in two games for his adopted country .
lukas podolski and mario gomez were also goalscorers in the penultimate friendly match for germany before the world cup .
with germany captain michael ballack ruled out of next month 's world cup through injury and substitute philipp lahm rested by coach joachim loew , bayern munich striker miroslav klose took the captaincy in budapest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski placed his shot into the top right corner sami khedira took over ballack ' slot in the german midfield and put in an impressive performance before being taken off with a minor muscle strain in the second half .
had it not been for a string of saves during the first half by hungary and 1860 munich keeper gabor kiraly , germany 's goal tally would have been much higher .
penalty breakthrough after just five minutes , germany won a penalty as per mertesacker was judged to have been fouled in the area during a bout of pre-free kick jostling .
podolski fired his shot into the top right hand corner to make it 1-0 .
the score stayed that way going into the break , and early in the second half loew brought on stuttgart striker cacau for midfielder mesut oezil , who had put several shots on frame in the first half and had been unlucky not to score .
mario gomez , also a substitute , added another goal from close range on 69 minutes , after being set up by marko marin .
in a solo effort on 72 minutes , cacau ran onto a headed mertesacker clearance that had taken a fortunate bounce through midfield and freed the striker for a run toward the hungarian goal .
he beat kiraly and tapped home to seal a convincing display from germany .

but the publishing world faces new challenges now that e-books and electronic reading devices have been thrown into the mix . germany likes to think of itself as ' the land of poets and thinkers . ' considering the nation has around 20,000 publishers , about 5,000 book-sellers and more than 90,000 new books hitting the market each year it may seem hard to disagree with that assessment . however , the country 's publishing industry has had a little extra help : germany operates a fixed book price system that allows publishers to set the cost of new releases . the time-honored pricing scheme has been is even protected under european union regulations .
ruth klinkenberg of marga schoeller bookstore in berlin believes that fixed prices keep her business alive . " for book stores like ours , it 's imperative . fixed prices take away the pressure of having to compete on price , ” she said , adding : “ i think if the fixed book price system went away , our bookstore and others like it , that , thank god still exist in berlin , they would all very quickly disappear .

gatekeepers to literature ?
traditional german booksellers are set to face unprecedented competition as the digitization of books becomes more commonplace . e-book devices like the sony reader and amazon kindle worry german publishers and booksellers , because they have the potential to eliminate , or at least weaken , the bookstore , just as mp3 players hurt the record business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth klinkenberg says fixed prices keep stores like hers in business ronald schild , an expert on the book market , says they threaten more than just commerce .

it allows shops to download latest releases to a sd card or mini-drive , and sell it to a customer . in the future , the files could simply be moved electronically from a virtual shelf to a wi-fi-capable e-reader with the push of a bookseller 's button . schild says this system ensures german booksellers get a fair share of e-book revenues , and will help keep traditional bookstores in business .

still , the same fixed-price laws that protect booksellers have a glitch when it comes to the virtual world .
legally , e-books are seen as a replacement for printed books , and as a result , must have set prices .
but when it comes to taxation , e-books are considered software or electronics - not books .
" we have a reduced vat sales tax on printed books of 7 percent but for e-books its 19 percent .
it 's very difficult to understand that .
it 's more a question for the tax authorities to distinguish between e-books and software and other electronic .
for the consumer it does n't make any sense , " schild said .
the higher tax and fixed prices mean that e-books are much more expensive in germany than in markets like the us , where the dominance of amazon and apple has led to price wars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de publishing -pipe- 29.05.2010 digital wave threatens germany 's fixed-price book world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of e-books in germany is growing the german book price fixing scheme has been in place for more than 120 years .
but the publishing world faces new challenges now that e-books and electronic reading devices have been thrown into the mix . germany likes to think of itself as ' the land of poets and thinkers . ' considering the nation has around 20,000 publishers , about 5,000 book-sellers and more than 90,000 new books hitting the market each year it may seem hard to disagree with that assessment . however , the country 's publishing industry has had a little extra help : germany operates a fixed book price system that allows publishers to set the cost of new releases . the time-honored pricing scheme has been is even protected under european union regulations .
ruth klinkenberg of marga schoeller bookstore in berlin believes that fixed prices keep her business alive . " for book stores like ours , it 's imperative . fixed prices take away the pressure of having to compete on price , ” she said , adding : “ i think if the fixed book price system went away , our bookstore and others like it , that , thank god still exist in berlin , they would all very quickly disappear . " the marga schoeller bookstore in berlin 's western neighborhood of savignyplatz is something of an institution in the german capital .
for over three-quarters of a century , the book shop has been hosting authors and revolutionarie .
it 's also home to ida , the cute shop dog .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ida the shop dog adds to the cosy atmosphere at marga schoeller bookstore booksellers ' dilemma the bookshop is known for its large selection of english language books .
while that is great for customers , klinkenberg points out that it presents problems for the booksellers . " because in germany there 's no fixed price for these books , we set our own . so in this area , we 're seeing just how hard it is to survive a price war , " klinkenberg said .
" sellers like amazon have other possibilities to offer certain titles at discounts as promotional items , and to attract customers .
that 's something we just ca n't do , it 's beyond us .
so unfortunately , over the last few years , we have noticed a sales slump for english-language literature , " she explained .
american online bookseller amazon has a popular german web shop , but it too must abide by the fixed price ruling . still , it does draw customers away from stores like marga schoeller by offering lower-priced english books and cheap second-hand books .
but that 's just the beginning of the huge challenge looming on the horizon .
gatekeepers to literature ?
traditional german booksellers are set to face unprecedented competition as the digitization of books becomes more commonplace . e-book devices like the sony reader and amazon kindle worry german publishers and booksellers , because they have the potential to eliminate , or at least weaken , the bookstore , just as mp3 players hurt the record business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth klinkenberg says fixed prices keep stores like hers in business ronald schild , an expert on the book market , says they threaten more than just commerce . " we fear that if there are single gatekeepers to the e-content market - if the e-book market is dominated by amazon or google or apple - that will not benefit cultural diversity , the number of books published , " he said .
" it is somewhat foreign to our understanding of freedom of speech and freedom of culture if there 's a gatekeeper to literature . " online platform schild is managing director of libreka , the german book trade 's secret weapon in the digital duel .
overseen by the german publishers and book sellers association , libreka is an online platform that keeps brick and mortar stores in the e-book loop .
it allows shops to download latest releases to a sd card or mini-drive , and sell it to a customer . in the future , the files could simply be moved electronically from a virtual shelf to a wi-fi-capable e-reader with the push of a bookseller 's button . schild says this system ensures german booksellers get a fair share of e-book revenues , and will help keep traditional bookstores in business .
bildunterschrift : book shop owners hope traditional hard-copy books will survive the digital onslaught software or book ?
still , the same fixed-price laws that protect booksellers have a glitch when it comes to the virtual world .
legally , e-books are seen as a replacement for printed books , and as a result , must have set prices .
but when it comes to taxation , e-books are considered software or electronics - not books .
" we have a reduced vat sales tax on printed books of 7 percent but for e-books its 19 percent .
it 's very difficult to understand that .
it 's more a question for the tax authorities to distinguish between e-books and software and other electronic .
for the consumer it does n't make any sense , " schild said .
the higher tax and fixed prices mean that e-books are much more expensive in germany than in markets like the us , where the dominance of amazon and apple has led to price wars .

the goal tally could have been higher , and a number of players showed themselves well . germany won a comfortable 3-0 victory against hungary as brazilian-born cacau scored his third goal in two games for his adopted country .
lukas podolski and mario gomez were also goalscorers in the penultimate friendly match for germany before the world cup .
with germany captain michael ballack ruled out of next month 's world cup through injury and substitute philipp lahm rested by coach joachim loew , bayern munich striker miroslav klose took the captaincy in budapest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski placed his shot into the top right corner sami khedira took over ballack ' slot in the german midfield and put in an impressive performance before being taken off with a minor muscle strain in the second half .
had it not been for a string of saves during the first half by hungary and 1860 munich keeper gabor kiraly , germany 's goal tally would have been much higher .
penalty breakthrough after just five minutes , germany won a penalty as per mertesacker was judged to have been fouled in the area during a bout of pre-free kick jostling .
podolski fired his shot into the top right hand corner to make it 1-0 .
the score stayed that way going into the break , and early in the second half loew brought on stuttgart striker cacau for midfielder mesut oezil , who had put several shots on frame in the first half and had been unlucky not to score .
mario gomez , also a substitute , added another goal from close range on 69 minutes , after being set up by marko marin .
in a solo effort on 72 minutes , cacau ran onto a headed mertesacker clearance that had taken a fortunate bounce through midfield and freed the striker for a run toward the hungarian goal .
he beat kiraly and tapped home to seal a convincing display from germany .

the plan was proposed at a un meeting in new york . israel denounced the planned meeting which is backed by nearly 200 nations , signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
" this resolution is deeply flawed and hypocritical , " netanyahu said during a visit to toronto , canada , on saturday .
" it ignores the realities of the middle east and the real threats facing the region and the entire world , " he insisted .
israel singled out his comments came after an agreement reached on friday at the 2010 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- ntp -rrb- review conference in new york , which calls for the conference on a nuclear-free middle east .
some 189 nations agreed to the 28-page document following a month-long conference on strengthening the npt .
the agreement makes special mention of israel , stressing " the importance of israel 's accession to the treaty and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive iaea safeguards . "
" it singles out israel , the middle east 's only true democracy and the only country threatened with annihilation , " netanyahu said .
the npt treaty did not mention other nuclear powers that have not signed up to the non-proliferation treaty , such as india and pakistan . netanyahu has the backing of us president barack obama , who said on friday that " we -lsb- the us -rsb- strongly oppose actions that jeopardize israel 's national security . "
israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons , but it refuses to deny or acknowledge their existence .
eu approval earlier on saturday , europe 's top diplomat praised the npt conference .
" i warmly welcome the consensus reached by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference , " said eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton in a statement .
" this shows that the multilateral non-proliferation and disarmament regime is alive and supported by all . "
it was the first agreement in 10 years on the npt , which has set the global agenda for fighting the spread of nuclear weapons since 1970 .
diplomats at the conference approved on friday a final document that laid out action plans on the three pillars of the treaty - disarmament , non-proliferation and the promotion of peaceful atomic energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton thinks halting the spread of nuclear weapons is an important goal currently there are 189 npt member countries , five of which are recognized as nuclear weapon states : the united states , russia , the united kingdom , france and china .

but the publishing world faces new challenges now that e-books and electronic reading devices have been thrown into the mix . germany likes to think of itself as ' the land of poets and thinkers . ' considering the nation has around 20,000 publishers , about 5,000 book-sellers and more than 90,000 new books hitting the market each year it may seem hard to disagree with that assessment . however , the country 's publishing industry has had a little extra help : germany operates a fixed book price system that allows publishers to set the cost of new releases . the time-honored pricing scheme has been is even protected under european union regulations .
ruth klinkenberg of marga schoeller bookstore in berlin believes that fixed prices keep her business alive . " for book stores like ours , it 's imperative . fixed prices take away the pressure of having to compete on price , ” she said , adding : “ i think if the fixed book price system went away , our bookstore and others like it , that , thank god still exist in berlin , they would all very quickly disappear . " the marga schoeller bookstore in berlin 's western neighborhood of savignyplatz is something of an institution in the german capital .
for over three-quarters of a century , the book shop has been hosting authors and revolutionarie .
it 's also home to ida , the cute shop dog .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ida the shop dog adds to the cosy atmosphere at marga schoeller bookstore booksellers ' dilemma the bookshop is known for its large selection of english language books .
while that is great for customers , klinkenberg points out that it presents problems for the booksellers . " because in germany there 's no fixed price for these books , we set our own . so in this area , we 're seeing just how hard it is to survive a price war , " klinkenberg said .
" sellers like amazon have other possibilities to offer certain titles at discounts as promotional items , and to attract customers .
that 's something we just ca n't do , it 's beyond us .
so unfortunately , over the last few years , we have noticed a sales slump for english-language literature , " she explained .
american online bookseller amazon has a popular german web shop , but it too must abide by the fixed price ruling . still , it does draw customers away from stores like marga schoeller by offering lower-priced english books and cheap second-hand books .
but that 's just the beginning of the huge challenge looming on the horizon .
gatekeepers to literature ?
traditional german booksellers are set to face unprecedented competition as the digitization of books becomes more commonplace . e-book devices like the sony reader and amazon kindle worry german publishers and booksellers , because they have the potential to eliminate , or at least weaken , the bookstore , just as mp3 players hurt the record business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth klinkenberg says fixed prices keep stores like hers in business ronald schild , an expert on the book market , says they threaten more than just commerce . " we fear that if there are single gatekeepers to the e-content market - if the e-book market is dominated by amazon or google or apple - that will not benefit cultural diversity , the number of books published , " he said .
" it is somewhat foreign to our understanding of freedom of speech and freedom of culture if there 's a gatekeeper to literature . " online platform schild is managing director of libreka , the german book trade 's secret weapon in the digital duel .
overseen by the german publishers and book sellers association , libreka is an online platform that keeps brick and mortar stores in the e-book loop .
it allows shops to download latest releases to a sd card or mini-drive , and sell it to a customer . in the future , the files could simply be moved electronically from a virtual shelf to a wi-fi-capable e-reader with the push of a bookseller 's button . schild says this system ensures german booksellers get a fair share of e-book revenues , and will help keep traditional bookstores in business .
bildunterschrift : book shop owners hope traditional hard-copy books will survive the digital onslaught software or book ?
still , the same fixed-price laws that protect booksellers have a glitch when it comes to the virtual world .
legally , e-books are seen as a replacement for printed books , and as a result , must have set prices .
but when it comes to taxation , e-books are considered software or electronics - not books .
" we have a reduced vat sales tax on printed books of 7 percent but for e-books its 19 percent .
it 's very difficult to understand that .
it 's more a question for the tax authorities to distinguish between e-books and software and other electronic .
for the consumer it does n't make any sense , " schild said .
the higher tax and fixed prices mean that e-books are much more expensive in germany than in markets like the us , where the dominance of amazon and apple has led to price wars .
the electronic format is also tempting to digital pirates .
schild points out that the latest harry potter novel went online as an illegal scan the same day it hit bookstores in hardback even though none of jk rowling 's books have been officially released for digital publication .

ruth klinkenberg of marga schoeller bookstore in berlin believes that fixed prices keep her business alive .

ruth klinkenberg of marga schoeller bookstore in berlin believes that fixed prices keep her business alive . " for book stores like ours , it 's imperative . fixed prices take away the pressure of having to compete on price , ” she said , adding : “ i think if the fixed book price system went away , our bookstore and others like it , that , thank god still exist in berlin , they would all very quickly disappear . " the marga schoeller bookstore in berlin 's western neighborhood of savignyplatz is something of an institution in the german capital .
for over three-quarters of a century , the book shop has been hosting authors and revolutionarie .
it 's also home to ida , the cute shop dog .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ida the shop dog adds to the cosy atmosphere at marga schoeller bookstore booksellers ' dilemma the bookshop is known for its large selection of english language books .
while that is great for customers , klinkenberg points out that it presents problems for the booksellers . " because in germany there 's no fixed price for these books , we set our own . so in this area , we 're seeing just how hard it is to survive a price war , " klinkenberg said .
" sellers like amazon have other possibilities to offer certain titles at discounts as promotional items , and to attract customers .
that 's something we just ca n't do , it 's beyond us .
so unfortunately , over the last few years , we have noticed a sales slump for english-language literature , " she explained .
american online bookseller amazon has a popular german web shop , but it too must abide by the fixed price ruling . still , it does draw customers away from stores like marga schoeller by offering lower-priced english books and cheap second-hand books .
but that 's just the beginning of the huge challenge looming on the horizon .
gatekeepers to literature ?
traditional german booksellers are set to face unprecedented competition as the digitization of books becomes more commonplace . e-book devices like the sony reader and amazon kindle worry german publishers and booksellers , because they have the potential to eliminate , or at least weaken , the bookstore , just as mp3 players hurt the record business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth klinkenberg says fixed prices keep stores like hers in business ronald schild , an expert on the book market , says they threaten more than just commerce . " we fear that if there are single gatekeepers to the e-content market - if the e-book market is dominated by amazon or google or apple - that will not benefit cultural diversity , the number of books published , " he said .
" it is somewhat foreign to our understanding of freedom of speech and freedom of culture if there 's a gatekeeper to literature . " online platform schild is managing director of libreka , the german book trade 's secret weapon in the digital duel .
overseen by the german publishers and book sellers association , libreka is an online platform that keeps brick and mortar stores in the e-book loop .
it allows shops to download latest releases to a sd card or mini-drive , and sell it to a customer . in the future , the files could simply be moved electronically from a virtual shelf to a wi-fi-capable e-reader with the push of a bookseller 's button . schild says this system ensures german booksellers get a fair share of e-book revenues , and will help keep traditional bookstores in business .

still , the same fixed-price laws that protect booksellers have a glitch when it comes to the virtual world .
legally , e-books are seen as a replacement for printed books , and as a result , must have set prices .
but when it comes to taxation , e-books are considered software or electronics - not books .
" we have a reduced vat sales tax on printed books of 7 percent but for e-books its 19 percent .
it 's very difficult to understand that .
it 's more a question for the tax authorities to distinguish between e-books and software and other electronic .
for the consumer it does n't make any sense , " schild said .
the higher tax and fixed prices mean that e-books are much more expensive in germany than in markets like the us , where the dominance of amazon and apple has led to price wars .
the electronic format is also tempting to digital pirates .
schild points out that the latest harry potter novel went online as an illegal scan the same day it hit bookstores in hardback even though none of jk rowling 's books have been officially released for digital publication .

the plan was proposed at a un meeting in new york . israel denounced the planned meeting which is backed by nearly 200 nations , signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
" this resolution is deeply flawed and hypocritical , " netanyahu said during a visit to toronto , canada , on saturday .
" it ignores the realities of the middle east and the real threats facing the region and the entire world , " he insisted .
israel singled out his comments came after an agreement reached on friday at the 2010 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- ntp -rrb- review conference in new york , which calls for the conference on a nuclear-free middle east .
some 189 nations agreed to the 28-page document following a month-long conference on strengthening the npt .
the agreement makes special mention of israel , stressing " the importance of israel 's accession to the treaty and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive iaea safeguards . "
" it singles out israel , the middle east 's only true democracy and the only country threatened with annihilation , " netanyahu said .
the npt treaty did not mention other nuclear powers that have not signed up to the non-proliferation treaty , such as india and pakistan . netanyahu has the backing of us president barack obama , who said on friday that " we -lsb- the us -rsb- strongly oppose actions that jeopardize israel 's national security . "
israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons , but it refuses to deny or acknowledge their existence .
eu approval earlier on saturday , europe 's top diplomat praised the npt conference .
" i warmly welcome the consensus reached by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference , " said eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton in a statement .
" this shows that the multilateral non-proliferation and disarmament regime is alive and supported by all . "
it was the first agreement in 10 years on the npt , which has set the global agenda for fighting the spread of nuclear weapons since 1970 .
diplomats at the conference approved on friday a final document that laid out action plans on the three pillars of the treaty - disarmament , non-proliferation and the promotion of peaceful atomic energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton thinks halting the spread of nuclear weapons is an important goal currently there are 189 npt member countries , five of which are recognized as nuclear weapon states : the united states , russia , the united kingdom , france and china .

the plan was proposed at a un meeting in new york . israel denounced the planned meeting which is backed by nearly 200 nations , signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
" this resolution is deeply flawed and hypocritical , " netanyahu said during a visit to toronto , canada , on saturday .
" it ignores the realities of the middle east and the real threats facing the region and the entire world , " he insisted .
israel singled out his comments came after an agreement reached on friday at the 2010 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- ntp -rrb- review conference in new york , which calls for the conference on a nuclear-free middle east .
some 189 nations agreed to the 28-page document following a month-long conference on strengthening the npt .
the agreement makes special mention of israel , stressing " the importance of israel 's accession to the treaty and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive iaea safeguards . "
" it singles out israel , the middle east 's only true democracy and the only country threatened with annihilation , " netanyahu said .
the npt treaty did not mention other nuclear powers that have not signed up to the non-proliferation treaty , such as india and pakistan . netanyahu has the backing of us president barack obama , who said on friday that " we -lsb- the us -rsb- strongly oppose actions that jeopardize israel 's national security .

" i warmly welcome the consensus reached by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference , " said eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton in a statement .
" this shows that the multilateral non-proliferation and disarmament regime is alive and supported by all . "
it was the first agreement in 10 years on the npt , which has set the global agenda for fighting the spread of nuclear weapons since 1970 .
diplomats at the conference approved on friday a final document that laid out action plans on the three pillars of the treaty - disarmament , non-proliferation and the promotion of peaceful atomic energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton thinks halting the spread of nuclear weapons is an important goal currently there are 189 npt member countries , five of which are recognized as nuclear weapon states : the united states , russia , the united kingdom , france and china .

the plan was proposed at a un meeting in new york . israel denounced the planned meeting which is backed by nearly 200 nations , signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
" this resolution is deeply flawed and hypocritical , " netanyahu said during a visit to toronto , canada , on saturday .
" it ignores the realities of the middle east and the real threats facing the region and the entire world , " he insisted .
israel singled out his comments came after an agreement reached on friday at the 2010 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- ntp -rrb- review conference in new york , which calls for the conference on a nuclear-free middle east .
some 189 nations agreed to the 28-page document following a month-long conference on strengthening the npt .

it was the first agreement in 10 years on the npt , which has set the global agenda for fighting the spread of nuclear weapons since 1970 .

the plan was proposed at a un meeting in new york . israel denounced the planned meeting which is backed by nearly 200 nations , signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
" this resolution is deeply flawed and hypocritical , " netanyahu said during a visit to toronto , canada , on saturday .
" it ignores the realities of the middle east and the real threats facing the region and the entire world , " he insisted .
israel singled out his comments came after an agreement reached on friday at the 2010 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- ntp -rrb- review conference in new york , which calls for the conference on a nuclear-free middle east .
some 189 nations agreed to the 28-page document following a month-long conference on strengthening the npt .
the agreement makes special mention of israel , stressing " the importance of israel 's accession to the treaty and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive iaea safeguards . "
" it singles out israel , the middle east 's only true democracy and the only country threatened with annihilation , " netanyahu said .
the npt treaty did not mention other nuclear powers that have not signed up to the non-proliferation treaty , such as india and pakistan . netanyahu has the backing of us president barack obama , who said on friday that " we -lsb- the us -rsb- strongly oppose actions that jeopardize israel 's national security .

" this shows that the multilateral non-proliferation and disarmament regime is alive and supported by all . "
it was the first agreement in 10 years on the npt , which has set the global agenda for fighting the spread of nuclear weapons since 1970 .

the goal tally could have been higher , and a number of players showed themselves well . germany won a comfortable 3-0 victory against hungary as brazilian-born cacau scored his third goal in two games for his adopted country .
lukas podolski and mario gomez were also goalscorers in the penultimate friendly match for germany before the world cup .
with germany captain michael ballack ruled out of next month 's world cup through injury and substitute philipp lahm rested by coach joachim loew , bayern munich striker miroslav klose took the captaincy in budapest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski placed his shot into the top right corner sami khedira took over ballack ' slot in the german midfield and put in an impressive performance before being taken off with a minor muscle strain in the second half .
had it not been for a string of saves during the first half by hungary and 1860 munich keeper gabor kiraly , germany 's goal tally would have been much higher .
penalty breakthrough after just five minutes , germany won a penalty as per mertesacker was judged to have been fouled in the area during a bout of pre-free kick jostling .
podolski fired his shot into the top right hand corner to make it 1-0 .
the score stayed that way going into the break , and early in the second half loew brought on stuttgart striker cacau for midfielder mesut oezil , who had put several shots on frame in the first half and had been unlucky not to score .
mario gomez , also a substitute , added another goal from close range on 69 minutes , after being set up by marko marin .
in a solo effort on 72 minutes , cacau ran onto a headed mertesacker clearance that had taken a fortunate bounce through midfield and freed the striker for a run toward the hungarian goal .
he beat kiraly and tapped home to seal a convincing display from germany .

but the publishing world faces new challenges now that e-books and electronic reading devices have been thrown into the mix . germany likes to think of itself as ' the land of poets and thinkers . ' considering the nation has around 20,000 publishers , about 5,000 book-sellers and more than 90,000 new books hitting the market each year it may seem hard to disagree with that assessment . however , the country 's publishing industry has had a little extra help : germany operates a fixed book price system that allows publishers to set the cost of new releases . the time-honored pricing scheme has been is even protected under european union regulations .
ruth klinkenberg of marga schoeller bookstore in berlin believes that fixed prices keep her business alive . " for book stores like ours , it 's imperative . fixed prices take away the pressure of having to compete on price , ” she said , adding : “ i think if the fixed book price system went away , our bookstore and others like it , that , thank god still exist in berlin , they would all very quickly disappear .

" sellers like amazon have other possibilities to offer certain titles at discounts as promotional items , and to attract customers .

the plan was proposed at a un meeting in new york . israel denounced the planned meeting which is backed by nearly 200 nations , signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
" this resolution is deeply flawed and hypocritical , " netanyahu said during a visit to toronto , canada , on saturday .
" it ignores the realities of the middle east and the real threats facing the region and the entire world , " he insisted .
israel singled out his comments came after an agreement reached on friday at the 2010 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- ntp -rrb- review conference in new york , which calls for the conference on a nuclear-free middle east .
some 189 nations agreed to the 28-page document following a month-long conference on strengthening the npt .

the plan was proposed at a un meeting in new york . israel denounced the planned meeting which is backed by nearly 200 nations , signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
" this resolution is deeply flawed and hypocritical , " netanyahu said during a visit to toronto , canada , on saturday .
" it ignores the realities of the middle east and the real threats facing the region and the entire world , " he insisted .
israel singled out his comments came after an agreement reached on friday at the 2010 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- ntp -rrb- review conference in new york , which calls for the conference on a nuclear-free middle east .
some 189 nations agreed to the 28-page document following a month-long conference on strengthening the npt .
the agreement makes special mention of israel , stressing " the importance of israel 's accession to the treaty and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive iaea safeguards . "
" it singles out israel , the middle east 's only true democracy and the only country threatened with annihilation , " netanyahu said .
the npt treaty did not mention other nuclear powers that have not signed up to the non-proliferation treaty , such as india and pakistan . netanyahu has the backing of us president barack obama , who said on friday that " we -lsb- the us -rsb- strongly oppose actions that jeopardize israel 's national security . "
israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons , but it refuses to deny or acknowledge their existence .
eu approval earlier on saturday , europe 's top diplomat praised the npt conference .
" i warmly welcome the consensus reached by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference , " said eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton in a statement .
" this shows that the multilateral non-proliferation and disarmament regime is alive and supported by all . "
it was the first agreement in 10 years on the npt , which has set the global agenda for fighting the spread of nuclear weapons since 1970 .

the goal tally could have been higher , and a number of players showed themselves well . germany won a comfortable 3-0 victory against hungary as brazilian-born cacau scored his third goal in two games for his adopted country .
lukas podolski and mario gomez were also goalscorers in the penultimate friendly match for germany before the world cup .
with germany captain michael ballack ruled out of next month 's world cup through injury and substitute philipp lahm rested by coach joachim loew , bayern munich striker miroslav klose took the captaincy in budapest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski placed his shot into the top right corner sami khedira took over ballack ' slot in the german midfield and put in an impressive performance before being taken off with a minor muscle strain in the second half .
had it not been for a string of saves during the first half by hungary and 1860 munich keeper gabor kiraly , germany 's goal tally would have been much higher .
penalty breakthrough after just five minutes , germany won a penalty as per mertesacker was judged to have been fouled in the area during a bout of pre-free kick jostling .
podolski fired his shot into the top right hand corner to make it 1-0 .
the score stayed that way going into the break , and early in the second half loew brought on stuttgart striker cacau for midfielder mesut oezil , who had put several shots on frame in the first half and had been unlucky not to score .
mario gomez , also a substitute , added another goal from close range on 69 minutes , after being set up by marko marin .

but the publishing world faces new challenges now that e-books and electronic reading devices have been thrown into the mix . germany likes to think of itself as ' the land of poets and thinkers . ' considering the nation has around 20,000 publishers , about 5,000 book-sellers and more than 90,000 new books hitting the market each year it may seem hard to disagree with that assessment . however , the country 's publishing industry has had a little extra help : germany operates a fixed book price system that allows publishers to set the cost of new releases . the time-honored pricing scheme has been is even protected under european union regulations .
ruth klinkenberg of marga schoeller bookstore in berlin believes that fixed prices keep her business alive . " for book stores like ours , it 's imperative . fixed prices take away the pressure of having to compete on price , ” she said , adding : “ i think if the fixed book price system went away , our bookstore and others like it , that , thank god still exist in berlin , they would all very quickly disappear .

so unfortunately , over the last few years , we have noticed a sales slump for english-language literature , " she explained .
american online bookseller amazon has a popular german web shop , but it too must abide by the fixed price ruling . still , it does draw customers away from stores like marga schoeller by offering lower-priced english books and cheap second-hand books .

gatekeepers to literature ?
traditional german booksellers are set to face unprecedented competition as the digitization of books becomes more commonplace . e-book devices like the sony reader and amazon kindle worry german publishers and booksellers , because they have the potential to eliminate , or at least weaken , the bookstore , just as mp3 players hurt the record business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth klinkenberg says fixed prices keep stores like hers in business ronald schild , an expert on the book market , says they threaten more than just commerce . " we fear that if there are single gatekeepers to the e-content market - if the e-book market is dominated by amazon or google or apple - that will not benefit cultural diversity , the number of books published , " he said .
" it is somewhat foreign to our understanding of freedom of speech and freedom of culture if there 's a gatekeeper to literature . " online platform schild is managing director of libreka , the german book trade 's secret weapon in the digital duel .
overseen by the german publishers and book sellers association , libreka is an online platform that keeps brick and mortar stores in the e-book loop .
it allows shops to download latest releases to a sd card or mini-drive , and sell it to a customer . in the future , the files could simply be moved electronically from a virtual shelf to a wi-fi-capable e-reader with the push of a bookseller 's button . schild says this system ensures german booksellers get a fair share of e-book revenues , and will help keep traditional bookstores in business .
bildunterschrift : book shop owners hope traditional hard-copy books will survive the digital onslaught software or book ?
still , the same fixed-price laws that protect booksellers have a glitch when it comes to the virtual world .
legally , e-books are seen as a replacement for printed books , and as a result , must have set prices .
but when it comes to taxation , e-books are considered software or electronics - not books .
" we have a reduced vat sales tax on printed books of 7 percent but for e-books its 19 percent .
it 's very difficult to understand that .
it 's more a question for the tax authorities to distinguish between e-books and software and other electronic .
for the consumer it does n't make any sense , " schild said .
the higher tax and fixed prices mean that e-books are much more expensive in germany than in markets like the us , where the dominance of amazon and apple has led to price wars .
the electronic format is also tempting to digital pirates .
schild points out that the latest harry potter novel went online as an illegal scan the same day it hit bookstores in hardback even though none of jk rowling 's books have been officially released for digital publication .

but the publishing world faces new challenges now that e-books and electronic reading devices have been thrown into the mix . germany likes to think of itself as ' the land of poets and thinkers . ' considering the nation has around 20,000 publishers , about 5,000 book-sellers and more than 90,000 new books hitting the market each year it may seem hard to disagree with that assessment . however , the country 's publishing industry has had a little extra help : germany operates a fixed book price system that allows publishers to set the cost of new releases . the time-honored pricing scheme has been is even protected under european union regulations .
ruth klinkenberg of marga schoeller bookstore in berlin believes that fixed prices keep her business alive . " for book stores like ours , it 's imperative . fixed prices take away the pressure of having to compete on price , ” she said , adding : “ i think if the fixed book price system went away , our bookstore and others like it , that , thank god still exist in berlin , they would all very quickly disappear .

american online bookseller amazon has a popular german web shop , but it too must abide by the fixed price ruling . still , it does draw customers away from stores like marga schoeller by offering lower-priced english books and cheap second-hand books .

but the publishing world faces new challenges now that e-books and electronic reading devices have been thrown into the mix . germany likes to think of itself as ' the land of poets and thinkers . ' considering the nation has around 20,000 publishers , about 5,000 book-sellers and more than 90,000 new books hitting the market each year it may seem hard to disagree with that assessment . however , the country 's publishing industry has had a little extra help : germany operates a fixed book price system that allows publishers to set the cost of new releases . the time-honored pricing scheme has been is even protected under european union regulations .
ruth klinkenberg of marga schoeller bookstore in berlin believes that fixed prices keep her business alive . " for book stores like ours , it 's imperative . fixed prices take away the pressure of having to compete on price , ” she said , adding : “ i think if the fixed book price system went away , our bookstore and others like it , that , thank god still exist in berlin , they would all very quickly disappear .

traditional german booksellers are set to face unprecedented competition as the digitization of books becomes more commonplace . e-book devices like the sony reader and amazon kindle worry german publishers and booksellers , because they have the potential to eliminate , or at least weaken , the bookstore , just as mp3 players hurt the record business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth klinkenberg says fixed prices keep stores like hers in business ronald schild , an expert on the book market , says they threaten more than just commerce . " we fear that if there are single gatekeepers to the e-content market - if the e-book market is dominated by amazon or google or apple - that will not benefit cultural diversity , the number of books published , " he said .
" it is somewhat foreign to our understanding of freedom of speech and freedom of culture if there 's a gatekeeper to literature . " online platform schild is managing director of libreka , the german book trade 's secret weapon in the digital duel .
overseen by the german publishers and book sellers association , libreka is an online platform that keeps brick and mortar stores in the e-book loop .
it allows shops to download latest releases to a sd card or mini-drive , and sell it to a customer . in the future , the files could simply be moved electronically from a virtual shelf to a wi-fi-capable e-reader with the push of a bookseller 's button . schild says this system ensures german booksellers get a fair share of e-book revenues , and will help keep traditional bookstores in business .
