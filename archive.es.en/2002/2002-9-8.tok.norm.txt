11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin germany -pipe- 08.09.2002 german police foil terrorist attack on september 11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police have been on high alert in the lead-up to the september 11 anniversary german police have arrested an american woman and her turkish boyfriend near the city of heidelberg on suspicion of planning an attack on the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks on september 11 in america . german officials are saying that a couple arrested on thursday near heidelberg believed to be planning a terrorist attack on the city 's historic center and nearby american military installations were likely acting on their own , without any connections to al qaeda or any other international terrorist network .
" based on what we know so far , we are dealing with an individual who has shown no indication of participation in a terrorist network , " federal interior minister otto schily told reporters on saturday .
" it seems that we are dealing with a dangerous individual with an islamic background . "
police arrested a 24-year-old man of turkish descent and his american girlfriend on thursday evening .
investigators are reported to have unearthed a large amount of explosives in the couple ’ s apartment .
thomas schäuble , interior minister for the state of baden-württemberg said in stuttgart , " we have evidence that an attack was planned for 11 september " .
he said that targets included american military bases in heidelberg as well as the historic heart of the city .
strict muslim and hatred of jews the minister also said that the turkish suspect , who was born in germany appeared to a follower of osama bin laden .
" he is a deeply religious muslim and harbours a hatred for americans and jews . "
schäuble said that the man ’ s 23-year-old american girlfriend , who worked in a supermarket in one of the many us military installations in the area , had also shown a hatred for jews .
huge cache of explosives discovered investigators who stormed the couple ’ s apartment on thursday found a large amount of raw explosives and about 130 kilograms of chemicals and electronic equipment in the couple ’ s apartment .
the interior ministry in baden-württemberg said that the material was suitable for making bombs .
investigators also discovered a picture of al qaeda leader osama bin laden , islamic literature and five pipe-bombs that had already been assembled .
germany ’ s bild newspaper reported that the man was caught red-handed handling chemicals on his balcony .
the man worked at a chemical warehouse in nearby karlsruhe .
schäuble said it still remained unclear whether the arrested was acting in isolation or belonged to a larger group .
the man was being interrogated , but was not being co-operative , he said .

in an interview to israeli radio , mr sharon said palestinian security under yasser arafat had become " terrorist organisations " and that the palestinians have failed to keep their part of a tentative truce agreement .
he also demanded a total cessation of violence and an overhaul of the palestinian authority before the peace process could be revived .
mr sharon 's comments come after he explicitly rejected the oslo peace process and amid renewed violence in the gaza strip .
security overhaul israel and the us have long demanded radical changes to the palestinian authority and its security apparatus .
both countries have said the various - often competing - security services should be restructured into one unified organisation .
" training and preparation of a new security apparatus will , i estimate , begin during the course of this month .
that 's a beginning , " mr sharon said .
he stressed that , for the peace process to resume , " there must be genuine reform , not what arafat is talking about at the moment " .
" those are games .
there 's nothing real there . "
mr sharon 's comments follow heavy criticism from both palestinians and the israeli opposition after his newspaper interview on friday in which he rejected the 1993 oslo peace accords .
" oslo does n't exist any more , camp david does n't exist any more , neither does taba , " mr sharon told the maariv newspaper .
" we will not return to these places . "
mr sharon 's statements came hours after fresh israeli incursion in the gaza strip and a spate of attacks by palestinian militants in which two israeli soldiers were killed .

by william gallagher bbc news online come back in a month or two .
having been a surprise hit in its first series , popstars is back for a second run with the smart idea of extending the premise to manufacture two bands that will compete for the uk 's next christmas number one .
it is a clever idea - and before we have heard the songs , before we have any idea about the singers , you can guarantee that this show will produce a hit .
any record company that has been planning its own christmas release had better ponder a new year one instead .
yet that battle is three months away and just for the moment the show is indistinguishable from its previous run , bar a new line-up of judges .
it is a parade of chiefly appalling would-be stars and , like last time , it reveals that hardly anyone wants to be a singer , they just want to be stars .
skin deep but then music is apparently not a priority for the judges either .
one contestant , jacob , was rejected over his singing but then had another chance because geri halliwell decided he looked good .
it was a revealing decision and harder still to justify when the show made a big deal out of limiting the numbers of contestants being picked to get to the next round .
three young women , for instance , were told that they were all good enough to go through but that only one would be picked .
that decision took place either side of an ad break , a specious way to bring some tension into a show that is really devoid of it so far .
the show will be a hit again and its new format will pay off at the end , but right now at the start of the run , the show is unsatisfying .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- test for einstein 's gravity speed theory news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : science / nature news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk sunday , 8 september , 2002 , 04:57 gmt 05:57 uk test for einstein 's gravity speed theory einstein : his ideas are being checked experimentally by helen briggs bbc news online science reporter a ground-breaking experiment is being carried out to measure the speed of gravity .
thanks to a useful planetary alignment , physicists hope to test the general theory of relativity .
if we find that the speed of gravity is faster than the speed of light then einstein 's theory of general relativity breaks down ed fomalont , astronomer on sunday , jupiter will pass close to the light coming from a quasar - an object that appears star-like but which is in reality billions of light-years away .
scientists hope this will enable them to test one of einstein 's assumptions , that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light -lrb- 300,000 km / s or 186,000 mps -rrb- .
jupiter 's gravity should nudge the light coming from the quasar , causing it to appear to shift a little in the sky .
astronomers hope to be able to measure this displacement , which depends on the speed of gravity .
einstein 's assumption appears to be true , based on indirect evidence , but has never before been proven .
virgin islands to hawaii scientists hope to measure the deplacement by comparing the quasar 's position with that of other quasars that are far away from jupiter as seen on the sky .
observations will be carried out using telescopes located in the virgin islands , hawaii and germany .
they include 10 very long baseline array -lrb- vlba -rrb- radio telescopes run by the us national radio astronomy observatory -lrb- nrao -rrb- and the max planck institute 's radio telescope in effelsberg .
quasars are very bright objects if all goes well , the technique will be accurate enough to give a useful estimate for the speed of gravity .
the team , led by sergei kopeikin of the university of missouri-columbia , us , will not get another chance for a decade .
" we believe the general theory of relativity is correct and that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light , " says dr kopeikin .
" japanese and nasa scientists also will be looking as well using other telescopes around the world , so we 'll be able to compare our findings . "
curved space researcher ed fomalont , an astronomer at the nrao , says there could be some surprises in store .
" if we find that the speed of gravity is faster than the speed of light then einstein 's theory of general relativity breaks down , " he told bbc news online .
the idea of testing whether gravity acts at the speed of light is an intriguing one , says michael rowan-robinson , an astrophysicist at imperial college , london , uk .
" einstein 's general theory of relativity is so dominant that we all assume gravity acts at the speed of light , " he says .
" but this does need to be tested . "
quasar an enormously bright object at the edge of the universe emits massive amounts of energy in an optical telescope , they appear point-like , similar to stars derive their name from stars -lrb- quasi-stellar -rrb- tom shanks , professor of physics at the university of durham , uk , thinks the experiment is a modern version of sir arthur eddington 's historic eclipse expedition .
" from einstein 's theory of gravity , that is his general relativity theory , we believe mass curves space and this can cause light to follow a curved path , " he told bbc news online .
" the first test of general relativity was to observe the bending effect of the sun 's mass on distant stars during an eclipse - sir arthur eddington in 1919 showed that the position of stars in the sky moved depending on whether the sun was near their line of sight .
" the amount they moved was close to the general relativity prediction , confirming that einstein 's theory was on the right track . "
he says the new experiment will do much the same thing using jupiter instead of the sun and quasars instead of stars .
many quasars emit strongly at radio wavelengths , so can be tracked very accurately by radio telescopes .
" this means that by watching what happens to the positions of the quasars on the sky as the gravitational field of jupiter moves past their line-of-sight , the scientists can test other aspects of the general relativity theory , " says professor shanks .
relativity questions one aspect is to check how soon the gravitational , space-curving , effect of jupiter is " felt " by the space around it , through which the quasar light is passing .
this will be done by seeing if the movement of the quasar positions caused by jupiter 's space curving effect follows the predictions of general relativity .
" if they do , then this will be a proof that gravity 's space-curving effect is transmitted at the speed of light , " he adds .
" if the quasar positions do not move according to the prediction of general relativity then it will suggest that gravity 's space-curving effect transmits at some other speed and place a question mark against the whole of einstein 's theory of general relativity .

according to research from the english tourism council , 88 % of uk residents said they did not change their travel plans , as a result of the terror attacks .
how did your plans change following september 11 made no difference to my plans at all : 88 % changed from taking a trip abroad to taking a trip in the uk : 5 % took fewer trips : 4 % changed to a different destination abroad : 4 % changed from taking a trip in the uk to taking a trip abroad : 2 % changed from visiting a city in the uk to going elsewhere in the uk : 2 % do n't know : 1 % source : english tourism council spending by uk residents on domestic tourism increased in the first half of this year , which was good news for the beleaguered industry which has suffered since the foot-and-mouth crisis and the us terror attacks .
but the industry is " still fragile " , the council warned , with an increasing number of businesses becoming less optimistic about its prospects during the second quarter of 2002 .
the council 's figures show that between january and may 2002 , more uk residents took tourism trips in england - up by 15 % to 52.4 million - compared with the same time last year .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- war with iraq could spark recession news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : business news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business e-commerce economy market data entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk sunday , 8 september , 2002 , 08:14 gmt 09:14 uk war with iraq could spark recession by emma clark bbc news online business staff as the us and the uk discuss strikes on iraq , bbc news online looks at how the conflict could hit consumers in the pocket .
imagine the nightmare scenario .
enormous casualties in iraq lead to major demonstrations in arab capitals .
middle east governments react with heavy-handed oppression - and one state , perhaps , descends into anarchy .
protests could lead to civil strife meanwhile , saddam hussein attacks israel with a scud missile .
israel retaliates and the palestinian conflict spills out into a regional confrontation .
" that would be middle east conflagration , " says ian bremmer , president of the research firm , eurasia group , in new york .
" that 'll push oil prices up !
" conflagration could have a long-term effect on the oil markets and push us into economic recession . "
analyse this we are , however , only speaking in scenarios - something analysts do a lot .
although most see war with iraq as an almost-certainty , the various , possible consequences of such a conflict are still being mapped out .
a spike in the oil price could be worrying " the day we start attacking opens up so many risks , " says mr bremmer .
one of the biggest risks for all of us watching the war on television would be the impact on our wallets .
the chain reaction starts with a spike in the cost of oil , which in turn raises business costs , leads to possible unemployment , or simply makes it more expensive to heat our homes and run our cars .
but for all the political tub-thumping , economists are remarkably sanguine about our economic prospects .
" there is considerable uncertainty about the amount of damage a conflict would do , " says nigel pain of london 's national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- .
" but for a recession there would have to be a sustained spike in the oil price . "
the cost of war at the moment , the cost of brent crude oil is hovering just below $ 30 a barrel .
during the gulf war of 1991 , it shot up above $ 40 .
if iraq 's facilities were upgraded , they could produce more oil analysts estimate that the current price includes a war premium of between $ 1 and $ 5 , which means that anxiety about an attack on iraq is already being priced in .
in the event of war , with iraqi oil off-tap , the oil price would probably jump , but the question is how high and for how long .
" if it persists at high levels , perhaps for six to nine months , then that could lead to a recession , " says mr pain .
however , most analysts are expecting a brief military campaign and - in the optimal scenario from their point of view - a change of regime in iraq .
industry is also much less dependent on oil than it was in the 1970s manouchehr takin centre for global energy studies with a " hamid karzai " installed in baghdad , the oil infrastructure could be upgraded and online within a couple of months , says manouchehr takin from the centre for global energy studies in london .

imagine the nightmare scenario .
enormous casualties in iraq lead to major demonstrations in arab capitals .
middle east governments react with heavy-handed oppression - and one state , perhaps , descends into anarchy .
meanwhile , saddam hussein attacks israel with a scud missile .
israel retaliates and the palestinian conflict spills out into a regional confrontation .
" that would be middle east conflagration , " says ian bremmer , president of the research firm , eurasia group , in new york .
" that 'll push oil prices up !
" conflagration could have a long-term effect on the oil markets and push us into economic recession . "
analyse this we are , however , only speaking in scenarios - something analysts do a lot .
although most see war with iraq as an almost-certainty , the various , possible consequences of such a conflict are still being mapped out .
" the day we start attacking opens up so many risks , " says mr bremmer .
one of the biggest risks for all of us watching the war on television would be the impact on our wallets .
the chain reaction starts with a spike in the cost of oil , which in turn raises business costs , leads to possible unemployment , or simply makes it more expensive to heat our homes and run our cars .
but for all the political tub-thumping , economists are remarkably sanguine about our economic prospects .
" there is considerable uncertainty about the amount of damage a conflict would do , " says nigel pain of london 's national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- .
" but for a recession there would have to be a sustained spike in the oil price . "
the cost of war at the moment , the cost of brent crude oil is hovering just below $ 30 a barrel .
during the gulf war of 1991 , it shot up above $ 40 .
analysts estimate that the current price includes a war premium of between $ 1 and $ 5 , which means that anxiety about an attack on iraq is already being priced in .
in the event of war , with iraqi oil off-tap , the oil price would probably jump , but the question is how high and for how long .
" if it persists at high levels , perhaps for six to nine months , then that could lead to a recession , " says mr pain .
however , most analysts are expecting a brief military campaign and - in the optimal scenario from their point of view - a change of regime in iraq . "
industry is also much less dependent on oil than it was in the 1970s " manouchehr takin centre for global energy studies with a " hamid karzai " installed in baghdad , the oil infrastructure could be upgraded and online within a couple of months , says manouchehr takin from the centre for global energy studies in london .
he believes that would up iraq 's current production capacity and , with the excess supply , even bring oil prices down .

but when we met earlier in the summer he tried to play down the prospect of a great clash between the unions and government over the private public partnership -lrb- ppp -rrb- on london underground . "
at times , to be quite honest , they 're very immature , and they 're very selfish and all they 're interested in is themselves " mick rix on the cbi he said it would be just one of many issues on the horizon - though he did later go on to brand those he said were set to make money out of ppp as the " scum of the earth " .
in person rix comes across as affable .
he has a ready laugh and is not beyond poking fun at himself and others in the union movement .
we met at aslef 's headquarters in the leafy , well heeled , north london suburb of hampstead .
it 's not often one gets to meet an interviewee 's pet dog - especially one that 's named che -lrb- guevara -rrb- keir -lrb- hardy -rrb- - a rather handsome golden retriever who appeared intermittently throughout the time we talked .
greed rix is clearly enjoying himself .
he talks of a renewed confidence in the union movement since labour came to power .
but he is also conscious that people will perceive union demands as too greedy .
at one point , responding to the suggestion that since 1997 there is a greater sense of expectation in trade unions , he jokes : " we 're like oliver are n't we ?
always asking for more . "
he is quick to add that he does n't think there is anything wrong with getting the best possible deal for his members - although the memory of having " no influence whatsoever " when the conservative party held power for 18 years seems never far from the front of his mind .
credit for cash he welcomes the investment now being put into transport and says the government deserves credit for putting in cash .
" we are talking about quite a few million jobs here that are protected for the long-term and that 's not only good for those who are seeking work and its good for the regeneration of the economy which will keep this country as a major economic powerhouse for the next 10 or 15 years .
" all praise to the government at the end of the day for actually trying to do those things but there are certain things that as we 've said they could do better . "
by that he means the way in which the railways are owned and funded as well as the need for some pretty fundamental infrastructure changes , he says .
rix says that though he recognises the government has delivered a lot it could deliver " a hell of a lot more " , which means in part reform of the uk 's employment laws .
selfish business ?
it clearly angers him that such calls , which he says are motivated by his desire for a successful economy , are resisted by the likes of employers ' organisations , such as the cbi , and big business .
" at times , to be quite honest , they 're very immature , and they 're very selfish and all they 're interested in is themselves . "
whenever -lsb- tony blair -rsb- does feel the chance to say perhaps it 's time to have a conversation apparently my members are on strike " mick rix " they 're not interested in the economy and they 're not interested in the fabric of the nation and the government has got some big hurdles to get over at the end of the day and we as trade unions if we show a collective , united approach on these issues i believe the government will give way over the next few years and introduce those rights , " he says .
he seems to believe that when it came to issues like ppp , the likes of the cbi were consulted more than the unions .
that prompts the question as to whether he has access to the prime minister .
it turns out that there has n't been any beer and sandwiches for rix at number 10 .
hallo tony " i 've had conversations very , very briefly - we say hello if we see each other but i would n't say that we know each other well .
" from what i understand that whenever he does feel the chance to say ' perhaps it 's time to have a conversation ' apparently my members are on strike which i think is a bit unfortunate , " he adds with a wry smile .
" you ask me what i would say to tony -lsb- about the ppp -rsb- .
well i would say ' you are going to make as big a bloody mess as the tories did over privatisation of the railways and do you want to be responsible for that ? ' because i believe it is a major issue in london which can detract on labour at the end of the day . "
the dilemma for rix and for other union leaders involved in representing workers in public services like transport is that when they strike it is hugely unpopular among the public .
rix says such opposition to strike action is a " by-product of the selfishness encouraged by the thatcherite right-wing " and he insists that most people would be genuinely supportive once they understood the reasons behind a dispute - " even if they are going to be inconvenienced " .
paramount to that explanation is concern over safety , he says - especially in the wake of a series of tragic train crashes on the national network .
rix says the last thing he wants to do is find himself saying " i told you so " in the wake of a n accident on the tube .
and he bitterly resents the cash he says will be made by accountants and management consultants as part of the ppp - money he believes should be going towards improvements .
" the silly , stupid situation is that the government has got itself hitched to delivering something which has cost £ 100m just for the consultants costs alone and that is before a penny is spent on actually modernising the tube , " he said .
" so if anybody thinks the tube is going to be modified to an acceptable standard and all the money that is going to be pumped into there is going to go into modernising the tube then think again .
" it 's going to line companies ' pockets , it 's going to line directors ' pockets , it 's going to line shareholders ' pockets , lawyers and consultants - all the scum of the earth that 's involved in all these preparations .
" they are going to make a mass of money out of what i believe will be londoners ' misery at the end of the day and i do n't think that 's good government . "

"
through the rally , we will reach out to the people in every part of gujarat and help them regain pride in their state " chief minister narendra modi at least 2,000 policemen have been deployed in the temple town of phagvel in the central district of kheba from where the gujarat gaurav yatra , or pride of gujarat , procession started .
the march - which will criss-cross through the state for 45 days - is being led by the chief minister , narendra modi , and the local bjp leader , rajendrasing rana .
the procession follows serious religious violence in gujarat earlier this year in which at least 1,000 people died .
march route billed as a celebration of gujarat 's achievements , the chariot procession is due to cover a 153 km route on sunday .
it will culminate in a public rally at himmatnagar in the northern district of sabarkantha .
the district collector of kheda said there was no tension in the district .
" we have made security arrangements considering that about 100,000 people will be there to listen to modi 's public address , " a local administrator told the associated press news agency .
on monday , the procession is due to cover a longer route of 187km .
the march has been planned to project a positive image of gujarat and the ruling bjp , said the organisers .
religious riots the march follows the worst religious violence in the state in a decade in which at least 1,000 people - mostly muslims were killed .
the violence started on 27 february after a mob - believed to be predominantly muslim - torched a train with hindu pilgrims .
nearly 60 people were killed in the attack , which sparked mass communal riots around the state .
many muslims condemned the decision to hold the march after the tragic events .
but mr modi on friday tried to allay fears that the procession had ideological motives .
" a lot of people feel that gujarat was born only after february 27 but they forget the gujarat that existed before that , " he said .
" this has damaged the image of gujarat and affected the pride and self-confidence of the people here .
" through the rally , we will reach out to the people in every part of gujarat and help them regain pride in their state . "
the procession was originally planned for 4 july but was put off amid fears that it might trigger a resurgence of the religious violence .
the bjp then said the march would be held on 3 september , but was forced to postpone it two more times , after the opposition congress party announced a parallel march .

but when we met ahead of this year 's blackpool conference , beyond admitting he was looking forward to having the opportunity to do other things , there was no suggestion he is slowing down in his role as general secretary of the transport and general workers union -lrb- tgwu -rrb- . "
good job i 'm not running for election given you saying how reasonable and comradely i am or i would probably lost all my votes " bill morris typically he is focused on a huge range of issues , both national and international .
the possibility of another war with iraq has morris worried and he was quick to issue a warning to prime minister tony blair .
he said : " i have to tell you that my union does not support any discussion whatsoever in the absence of any hard evidence that we as a nation should now be prepared to bomb iraq .
" i want to see , my union wants to see , clear , demonstrable evidence that he is preparing weapons of mass destruction .
" i want our prime minister to concentrate on what 's important here and not to sort of drift us off to a position where we are following on the coat-tails of another power . "
unions owed ?
the labour government should also get on with paying back the unions for their support , particularly in the lean , early years of blair 's first administration .
" my message to the prime minister as he addresses the conference is to recognise that every balance sheet has two sides - there 's a credit and a debit , " mr morris told bbc news online .
" we -lsb- the union movement -rsb- have over the last five years of the labour government significantly addressed the debit side : we 've delivered on every single count in terms of days lost through industrial disputes , in terms of the quality of what we do , in terms of the relationship supporting government .
" now we want the government to address the credit side . "
by that he means issues like low pay , the current crisis over pensions , the plight of british manufacturing and working conditions .
the 11 september attack last year postponed the widely-predicted clash between the prime minister and the unions particularly over his determination to use ever greater amounts of private cash in the public sector .
morris predicts that of the " unfinished business " from last year , reform of public services , will dominate the debate .
albatross " it seems to me that the issue of the private finance initiative -lrb- pfi -rrb- is or can be a political albatross which will come back to haunt the government if the government does n't guarantee delivery of transparent and measurable improvement in public services . "
he adds : " we 're not saying to them that we 're going to take to the streets and that workers are going to shut up shop to get them to stop this particular policy .
" what we are saying to them is the cost of these ppps -lrb- public private partnerships -rrb- and the pfis is so horrendous for the next generation because some of the people who are funding the capital up front are taking 30 year profit up front . "
whatever happens with this debate - and the prime minister like many union leaders has shown he is no mood to back off - morris says that improvements in public services will be hard to achieve unless public sector workers get a better deal .
british workers , he says , have fewer rights than their european counterparts : for example it is " too cheap and too easy to sack british workers " .
he also argues that public services make a moral statement about society .
key debate " you tell me or show me how you treat your pensioners , the quality of your transport , or how you treat your children and i will tell whether you are a caring society , whether you 've got compassion , whether you are concerned and whether you bridge the generation in terms of prosperity of the nation and therefore public services are important . "
public services are also the issue which morris believes will win or lose labour the next election and he fears that issues such as uk entry into the single currency will detract from that - although he acknowledges the euro remains a key debate for britain .
" it 's a debate that must be informed by reality and not informed by mad rush and that 's why i continue to argue that we should fix our public services - it 's on that experience that the next election will be decided . "
morris is at heart a campaigner so when he does eventually retire he wants to travel , spend time with family and read , but he also intends to throw himself into supporting various educational institutions in the uk and jamaica .
with left-wingers taking control of many of the uk 's unions , morris ' days at the head of the tgwu may soon be looked back to with a great deal of nostalgia in downing street .
reasonable comrade ?
asked if he thinks he is now seen as a comparatively moderate trade union leader morris retorts with a smile : " good job i 'm not running for election given you saying how reasonable and comradely i am or i would probably lose all my votes .
" we all have our approach we all have our style , we all set ourselves our own objectives and approach it in a different way i 've made my mistakes using my comradely approach and i have no doubt that tomorrows generation will also make mistakes .
" what is important is that we all learn from them , never to be repeated and use that experience to build something that is more tangible , something more long-lasting , more enduring .
" but at all times what we must do has to be for the common good of our members and for the common good of our society of which we are a part . "

add your comments too .
thursday 5 september passports at the ready ! posted by nick -pipe- 1110 bst -pipe- add comment camp david this weekend looks set to be just the first stop on the latest mystery tour of bush 's ally-in-chief and principal coalition builder .
tony blair is set to visit moscow in mid-october .
the prime minister believes that president putin is a vital ally in any confrontation with iraq , and think that it 's moscow 's economic links with baghdad that pose a problem and not any attachment to saddam hussein or opposition to military action .
iraq owes russia squillions of dollars - putin puts the figure at 11 billion ! - and blair feels that if that problem can be addressed , moscow will not be the obstacle many are saying it will .
the politically astute among you -lrb- and the cynical -rrb- may note that the pm will don furry hat at putin 's dacha on the same day that iain duncan smith makes his party conference speech .
a stunt last pulled by margaret thatcher when she took to " the man i can do business with " - mikhail gorbachev . - wednesday 4 september as if saddam was n't enough ... posted by nick -pipe- 1610 bst -pipe- add comment after yesterday 's sedgefield spectacular , there 's much talk about whether tony blair can persuade his party and the public to back a war with iraq .
few seem to have noticed that before then , he 's got an even tougher task - to persuade his party and the public to trust in " my friend " george w bush .
on friday he will travel to camp david to meet mr bush and talk about the " iraqi threat " .
not since the days of ronald reagan do i recall such hostility and indeed contempt for the occupant of the white house - those of you old enough to recall the tv satire spitting image remember with a grin the " president 's brain is missing " sketch .
even that would , i suspect , be regarded as too kind to george w. yet tony blair - political ally and personal friend of bill clinton - insists in public and in private that george bush is cleverer than anyone gives him credit for , that he is really in charge of his administration and that he " is disarmingly open " .
whether the prime minister can persuade even a fraction of his critics of that analysis may hold the key to whether he can persuade them on the bigger debate - whether to risk british lives to confront saddam hussein .
more details - tuesday 3 september welcome back after the break ! posted by nick -pipe- 1110 bst -pipe- add comment so it 's back to school .
i have just stepped off a flight from devon to newcastle - i 've gone from building sandcastles to questioning the prime minister in just 24 hours .
a chance on the flight up to muse about a fascinating few months in politics to come .
one minister i saw over the summer who is n't prone to hyperbole told me that the decisions tony blair is about to take could define politics for a generation .
he meant , of course , the decision whether to join an american attack on iraq .
there is of course the minor matter of whether to scrap our national currency as well .
do n't expect any new announcements in tony blair 's news conference this afternoon .
what we will see , i think , is him making the argument that saddam hussein is a real threat not just to the world but to britain specifically , and that therefore doing nothing is not an option .
but he 's already gone much further than many people remember .
at his talks with george bush in crawford in april , he backed the case for a " regime change " -lrb- though he did n't use those words -rrb- , and pre-emptive military action if necessary .
what will be interesting to see is how he deals with the tide of hostile opinion while he was away - not just in the arab world , not just in opinion polls , not just from bishops , but in his own party and from his own cabinet .
-lrb- who says grassroots politics is dead ? -rrb-
i suspect he will try to get president bush back on course rhetorically , stressing that iraq is already in breach of un resolutions .
his view in a nutshell is , i believe : " everyone knows saddam 's developing weapons of mass destruction .
everyone knows he 'd use or threaten to use them if he could , so what else would you do to stop him ? "
however this debate shapes up , i ca n't help feeling that tony blair will find that , like harold wilson before him , his stance towards an american war will make him a figure of hatred among a significant proportion of the labour movement who will never forget and may never forgive .
incidentally , it 's a theory i once put to him on a flight to god knows where .
his answer was a trademark withering look and the phrase " thanks nick " .
