young people largely ignorant coinciding with the unaids report , a landmark study compiled by the unicef , unaids and the world health organisation which takes a comprehensive look at the behaviour and knowledge relating to hiv / aids of young people aged 15-24 years has thrown up an alarming find .
it says that over 50 percent of young people aged between 15-24 surveyed in 60 countries have no idea how hiv / aids is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
at the same time the study shows that adolescence is the time when the majority of people become sexually active .

today , 40 million people world-wide are infected by the hiv virus ; an estimated 68 million people will die from aids in the developing world over the next 18 years .
questions , problems – where are the answers ?
the 14th international aids conference that kicks off in barcelona on sunday will see 15,000 delegates from all walks of life – scientists , politicians , community workers , aids activists , doctors , donors and counsellors participating in the week-long brainstorming session .
as public awareness of the aids crisis increases and the political momentum to tackle aids grows , delegates will be under pressure to provide answers to what is increasingly being perceived as a global threat .
what can stop the virus ?
what can help people , who are infected with the hiv virus ?
how can the vicious cycle of unsafe sex , poverty , ignorance and lack of political will be broken ?
how can anti-retroviral drugs be made more easily available and affordable for the hiv-infected in developing countries ?
grim reading the latest unaids report published just a week before the conference in spain takes off , underscores the urgency in coming up with a cohesive global action plan .
the report warns that the aids epidemic is still in its early stages and is spreading rapidly throughout africa , asia , the caribbean and eastern europe .
it especially threatens to wipe out a generation in africa and destabilise the whole continent .
of a record 3 million people killed by aids last year , 2.2 million alone were from africa .
dr. peter piot , unaids ' executive director , told reuters the disease was eating away africa ’ s work force , inhibiting economic development and aggravating famines .
aids killer in africa , russia and eastern europe it unaids report reveals that botswana has the highest hiv infection rates in the world , with 39 percent of the adult population now affected .
the epidemic is chiefly spread through heterosexual sex without condoms , life expectancy in botswana has dropped below 40 for the first time since 1950 .
away from africa , the unaids report also warns of epidemics in highly-populated countries like china , indonesia and those in the former soviet-union .
the disease is spreading fastest in russia and eastern europe and is moving from injecting drug users to the wider population .
young people largely ignorant coinciding with the unaids report , a landmark study compiled by the unicef , unaids and the world health organisation which takes a comprehensive look at the behaviour and knowledge relating to hiv / aids of young people aged 15-24 years has thrown up an alarming find .
it says that over 50 percent of young people aged between 15-24 surveyed in 60 countries have no idea how hiv / aids is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
at the same time the study shows that adolescence is the time when the majority of people become sexually active .
un organisations are now calling for aids-related efforts to centre on working with young people to provide them with knowledge about hiv and how to avoid infection .
aids in germany in germany , some 60,000 people have been infected with hiv since the mid-80s .
the berlin-based robert koch institute reports that 19,000 people have died from aids in germany .
while public concern about aids has been waning in recent years , the federal center for health education said recently that this appears to be changing .
since the early 1990s , the agency has backed a series of billboards under the headline " mach ’ s mit " or " do it with " .
the " with " referrring to condoms .
the public is invited to send in suggestions for billboards , which always feature a colored condom as part of the design .
the latest campaign , aimed at reminding people to use condoms while on vacation , is a place-setting with fork , knife and condom-plate under the headline " bed & breakfast " .
the condom manufacturer durex says that about 75 percent of young adults in germany use a condom when having sex for the first time with a new partner .
elisabeth pott , director of the center for health education , attributed increased awareness to this ad campaign .
facts remain murky however , while germans are more aware about aids than in recent years , their knowledge about it remains murky .
a recent survey of german youth showed that 25 percent did not know that an hiv infection is contagious before aids develops and 20 percent of young singles believe that hiv leaves physical marks that are visible on people who are infected .
meanwhile , about 2,000 people are infected with hiv each year in germany , about 1,500 of them men .
in germany , about 50 percent of all new infections come from homosexual contact between men ; 21 percent from immigrants coming from countries with high infection rates ; 18 percent from heterosexual sex ; 10 percent from the use of contaminated needles during drug use and 1 percent from the transfer of the infection from mother to child during pregnancy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links 14th international aids conference barcelona unaids 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2002 schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder says the economy will grow as much as 3 percent next year the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .
but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .

german politicians are calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers to avoid the accounting problems plaguing american corporations . germany 's government and opposition parties are responding to the accounting scandals at u.s. companies enron and worldcom , and the large-scale jitters that these caused on the stock markets , by calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers .
if the governing social democratic party forms the next government , it will introduce " ; tighter controls over the controllers , " ; said jörg-otto spiller , one of the party 's experts on finance policy , who is also designated president of bafin , the federal body responsible for supervision of the financial-services industry .
in spiller 's view , bafin must be given more powers to examine the work of the auditors .
he said increasing numbers of people are investing in equities and equity-based funds to finance their retirement .
an increased incidence of balance-sheet falsification would put such investments at risk .
opposition parties also called for changes to protect investors from more enron / worldcom-style scandals .
rainer brüderle , vice-president of the liberal fdp , joined the spd in calling for more powers to be invested in bafin .

the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the 89th tour de france will kick off in luxembourg on saturday .
three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .
" everybody else will have to fight it out for second place . "
next to the clear-cut favorite , the spaniards igor gonzalez de galdeano , oscar sevilla and joseba beloki are expected to reach top positions next to mountain-expert santiago botero from columbia and richard virenque from france .
german modesty following the tour cancellation by 1997 tour winner jan ullrich , the german telekom team places high hopes on captain erik zabel , who was awarded the green jersey for the largest overall amount of points obtained in stage victories in the six previous years .
the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "
lightening the workload racing officials have shortened the course by 170 km as a reaction to the scandals , making it the shortest tour since 1905 .
" one can not claim to fight against doping and -lrb- at the same time -rrb- impose increasingly heavier workloads on the riders , " leblanc told the trade magazine cycling world .
" this year , by moving some starting locations , we were able to save on distance to some extent . "

with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2002 schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder says the economy will grow as much as 3 percent next year the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .
but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .

the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2002 schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder says the economy will grow as much as 3 percent next year the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .
but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the 89th tour de france will kick off in luxembourg on saturday .
three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .
" everybody else will have to fight it out for second place . "
next to the clear-cut favorite , the spaniards igor gonzalez de galdeano , oscar sevilla and joseba beloki are expected to reach top positions next to mountain-expert santiago botero from columbia and richard virenque from france .
german modesty following the tour cancellation by 1997 tour winner jan ullrich , the german telekom team places high hopes on captain erik zabel , who was awarded the green jersey for the largest overall amount of points obtained in stage victories in the six previous years .
the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "
lightening the workload racing officials have shortened the course by 170 km as a reaction to the scandals , making it the shortest tour since 1905 .
" one can not claim to fight against doping and -lrb- at the same time -rrb- impose increasingly heavier workloads on the riders , " leblanc told the trade magazine cycling world .
" this year , by moving some starting locations , we were able to save on distance to some extent . "
with a decrease in distance comes an increase in drug testing .
ten riders will be randomly screened after each of stage of the race . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .

the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .

a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .

since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .

the 89th tour de france will kick off in luxembourg on saturday .
three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .
" everybody else will have to fight it out for second place . "
next to the clear-cut favorite , the spaniards igor gonzalez de galdeano , oscar sevilla and joseba beloki are expected to reach top positions next to mountain-expert santiago botero from columbia and richard virenque from france .
german modesty following the tour cancellation by 1997 tour winner jan ullrich , the german telekom team places high hopes on captain erik zabel , who was awarded the green jersey for the largest overall amount of points obtained in stage victories in the six previous years .
the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.07.2002 who ’ s an expert on family values ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " everyone is their own expert in matters concerning the family , " said katherina reiche as she was appointed by opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber to a key advisory post .
with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .
at least the conservatives ’ election team gained a young face , said claudia roth , chief of the greens .
but stoiber , roth said , " has looked very old in the last few days . "
chancellor gerhard schröder seems to gain the most points in the whole debate , which is an interesting turn of events for a man who is on his fourth marriage . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links katherina reiche 's web site overview of her work .

german politicians are calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers to avoid the accounting problems plaguing american corporations . germany 's government and opposition parties are responding to the accounting scandals at u.s. companies enron and worldcom , and the large-scale jitters that these caused on the stock markets , by calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers .
if the governing social democratic party forms the next government , it will introduce " ; tighter controls over the controllers , " ; said jörg-otto spiller , one of the party 's experts on finance policy , who is also designated president of bafin , the federal body responsible for supervision of the financial-services industry .
in spiller 's view , bafin must be given more powers to examine the work of the auditors .
he said increasing numbers of people are investing in equities and equity-based funds to finance their retirement .
an increased incidence of balance-sheet falsification would put such investments at risk .
opposition parties also called for changes to protect investors from more enron / worldcom-style scandals .
rainer brüderle , vice-president of the liberal fdp , joined the spd in calling for more powers to be invested in bafin .
meanwhile , matthias wissmann , economic-policy expert of the conservative cdu called for new rules to stop a single company from being able to serve another both in an advisory capacity and as auditor . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.07.2002 who ’ s an expert on family values ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " everyone is their own expert in matters concerning the family , " said katherina reiche as she was appointed by opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber to a key advisory post .
with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .
at least the conservatives ’ election team gained a young face , said claudia roth , chief of the greens .
but stoiber , roth said , " has looked very old in the last few days . "
chancellor gerhard schröder seems to gain the most points in the whole debate , which is an interesting turn of events for a man who is on his fourth marriage . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links katherina reiche 's web site overview of her work .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.07.2002 who ’ s an expert on family values ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " everyone is their own expert in matters concerning the family , " said katherina reiche as she was appointed by opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber to a key advisory post .
with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .
at least the conservatives ’ election team gained a young face , said claudia roth , chief of the greens .
but stoiber , roth said , " has looked very old in the last few days . "
chancellor gerhard schröder seems to gain the most points in the whole debate , which is an interesting turn of events for a man who is on his fourth marriage . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links katherina reiche 's web site overview of her work .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .

how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .

the 89th tour de france will kick off in luxembourg on saturday .
three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .
" everybody else will have to fight it out for second place . "
next to the clear-cut favorite , the spaniards igor gonzalez de galdeano , oscar sevilla and joseba beloki are expected to reach top positions next to mountain-expert santiago botero from columbia and richard virenque from france .
german modesty following the tour cancellation by 1997 tour winner jan ullrich , the german telekom team places high hopes on captain erik zabel , who was awarded the green jersey for the largest overall amount of points obtained in stage victories in the six previous years .
the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "
lightening the workload racing officials have shortened the course by 170 km as a reaction to the scandals , making it the shortest tour since 1905 .
" one can not claim to fight against doping and -lrb- at the same time -rrb- impose increasingly heavier workloads on the riders , " leblanc told the trade magazine cycling world .
" this year , by moving some starting locations , we were able to save on distance to some extent . "
with a decrease in distance comes an increase in drug testing .

the 89th tour de france will kick off in luxembourg on saturday .
three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .
" everybody else will have to fight it out for second place . "
next to the clear-cut favorite , the spaniards igor gonzalez de galdeano , oscar sevilla and joseba beloki are expected to reach top positions next to mountain-expert santiago botero from columbia and richard virenque from france .
german modesty following the tour cancellation by 1997 tour winner jan ullrich , the german telekom team places high hopes on captain erik zabel , who was awarded the green jersey for the largest overall amount of points obtained in stage victories in the six previous years .
the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "
lightening the workload racing officials have shortened the course by 170 km as a reaction to the scandals , making it the shortest tour since 1905 .
" one can not claim to fight against doping and -lrb- at the same time -rrb- impose increasingly heavier workloads on the riders , " leblanc told the trade magazine cycling world .

it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "
lightening the workload racing officials have shortened the course by 170 km as a reaction to the scandals , making it the shortest tour since 1905 .
" one can not claim to fight against doping and -lrb- at the same time -rrb- impose increasingly heavier workloads on the riders , " leblanc told the trade magazine cycling world .
" this year , by moving some starting locations , we were able to save on distance to some extent . "
with a decrease in distance comes an increase in drug testing .
ten riders will be randomly screened after each of stage of the race . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .
at least the conservatives ’ election team gained a young face , said claudia roth , chief of the greens .

in germany , meanwhile , public awareness is growing but many young people remain uninformed about risks . when five homosexual men were first detected as having aids in san francisco in 1981 , most put it down to an infection afflicting homosexuals and drug-addicts .
20 years later , hardly anyone would dream of suggesting that .
rapid rise of a killer disease aids has killed more than 20 million since its discovery in 1981 and created 14 million orphans according to the unaids , the agency that co-ordinates the united nations ' aids programs .
today , 40 million people world-wide are infected by the hiv virus ; an estimated 68 million people will die from aids in the developing world over the next 18 years .
questions , problems – where are the answers ?
the 14th international aids conference that kicks off in barcelona on sunday will see 15,000 delegates from all walks of life – scientists , politicians , community workers , aids activists , doctors , donors and counsellors participating in the week-long brainstorming session .
as public awareness of the aids crisis increases and the political momentum to tackle aids grows , delegates will be under pressure to provide answers to what is increasingly being perceived as a global threat .
what can stop the virus ?
what can help people , who are infected with the hiv virus ?
how can the vicious cycle of unsafe sex , poverty , ignorance and lack of political will be broken ?
how can anti-retroviral drugs be made more easily available and affordable for the hiv-infected in developing countries ?
grim reading the latest unaids report published just a week before the conference in spain takes off , underscores the urgency in coming up with a cohesive global action plan .
the report warns that the aids epidemic is still in its early stages and is spreading rapidly throughout africa , asia , the caribbean and eastern europe .
it especially threatens to wipe out a generation in africa and destabilise the whole continent .
of a record 3 million people killed by aids last year , 2.2 million alone were from africa .
dr. peter piot , unaids ' executive director , told reuters the disease was eating away africa ’ s work force , inhibiting economic development and aggravating famines .
aids killer in africa , russia and eastern europe it unaids report reveals that botswana has the highest hiv infection rates in the world , with 39 percent of the adult population now affected .
the epidemic is chiefly spread through heterosexual sex without condoms , life expectancy in botswana has dropped below 40 for the first time since 1950 .
away from africa , the unaids report also warns of epidemics in highly-populated countries like china , indonesia and those in the former soviet-union .
the disease is spreading fastest in russia and eastern europe and is moving from injecting drug users to the wider population .
young people largely ignorant coinciding with the unaids report , a landmark study compiled by the unicef , unaids and the world health organisation which takes a comprehensive look at the behaviour and knowledge relating to hiv / aids of young people aged 15-24 years has thrown up an alarming find .
it says that over 50 percent of young people aged between 15-24 surveyed in 60 countries have no idea how hiv / aids is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
at the same time the study shows that adolescence is the time when the majority of people become sexually active .
un organisations are now calling for aids-related efforts to centre on working with young people to provide them with knowledge about hiv and how to avoid infection .
aids in germany in germany , some 60,000 people have been infected with hiv since the mid-80s .
the berlin-based robert koch institute reports that 19,000 people have died from aids in germany .
while public concern about aids has been waning in recent years , the federal center for health education said recently that this appears to be changing .
since the early 1990s , the agency has backed a series of billboards under the headline " mach ’ s mit " or " do it with " .
the " with " referrring to condoms .
the public is invited to send in suggestions for billboards , which always feature a colored condom as part of the design .
the latest campaign , aimed at reminding people to use condoms while on vacation , is a place-setting with fork , knife and condom-plate under the headline " bed & breakfast " .
the condom manufacturer durex says that about 75 percent of young adults in germany use a condom when having sex for the first time with a new partner .
elisabeth pott , director of the center for health education , attributed increased awareness to this ad campaign .
facts remain murky however , while germans are more aware about aids than in recent years , their knowledge about it remains murky .
a recent survey of german youth showed that 25 percent did not know that an hiv infection is contagious before aids develops and 20 percent of young singles believe that hiv leaves physical marks that are visible on people who are infected .
meanwhile , about 2,000 people are infected with hiv each year in germany , about 1,500 of them men .
in germany , about 50 percent of all new infections come from homosexual contact between men ; 21 percent from immigrants coming from countries with high infection rates ; 18 percent from heterosexual sex ; 10 percent from the use of contaminated needles during drug use and 1 percent from the transfer of the infection from mother to child during pregnancy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links 14th international aids conference barcelona unaids 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in germany , meanwhile , public awareness is growing but many young people remain uninformed about risks . when five homosexual men were first detected as having aids in san francisco in 1981 , most put it down to an infection afflicting homosexuals and drug-addicts .
20 years later , hardly anyone would dream of suggesting that .
rapid rise of a killer disease aids has killed more than 20 million since its discovery in 1981 and created 14 million orphans according to the unaids , the agency that co-ordinates the united nations ' aids programs .
today , 40 million people world-wide are infected by the hiv virus ; an estimated 68 million people will die from aids in the developing world over the next 18 years .
questions , problems – where are the answers ?
the 14th international aids conference that kicks off in barcelona on sunday will see 15,000 delegates from all walks of life – scientists , politicians , community workers , aids activists , doctors , donors and counsellors participating in the week-long brainstorming session .
as public awareness of the aids crisis increases and the political momentum to tackle aids grows , delegates will be under pressure to provide answers to what is increasingly being perceived as a global threat .
what can stop the virus ?
what can help people , who are infected with the hiv virus ?
how can the vicious cycle of unsafe sex , poverty , ignorance and lack of political will be broken ?
how can anti-retroviral drugs be made more easily available and affordable for the hiv-infected in developing countries ?
grim reading the latest unaids report published just a week before the conference in spain takes off , underscores the urgency in coming up with a cohesive global action plan .
the report warns that the aids epidemic is still in its early stages and is spreading rapidly throughout africa , asia , the caribbean and eastern europe .
it especially threatens to wipe out a generation in africa and destabilise the whole continent .
of a record 3 million people killed by aids last year , 2.2 million alone were from africa .
dr. peter piot , unaids ' executive director , told reuters the disease was eating away africa ’ s work force , inhibiting economic development and aggravating famines .
aids killer in africa , russia and eastern europe it unaids report reveals that botswana has the highest hiv infection rates in the world , with 39 percent of the adult population now affected .
the epidemic is chiefly spread through heterosexual sex without condoms , life expectancy in botswana has dropped below 40 for the first time since 1950 .
away from africa , the unaids report also warns of epidemics in highly-populated countries like china , indonesia and those in the former soviet-union .
the disease is spreading fastest in russia and eastern europe and is moving from injecting drug users to the wider population .
young people largely ignorant coinciding with the unaids report , a landmark study compiled by the unicef , unaids and the world health organisation which takes a comprehensive look at the behaviour and knowledge relating to hiv / aids of young people aged 15-24 years has thrown up an alarming find .
it says that over 50 percent of young people aged between 15-24 surveyed in 60 countries have no idea how hiv / aids is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
at the same time the study shows that adolescence is the time when the majority of people become sexually active .

with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .
at least the conservatives ’ election team gained a young face , said claudia roth , chief of the greens .
but stoiber , roth said , " has looked very old in the last few days . "
chancellor gerhard schröder seems to gain the most points in the whole debate , which is an interesting turn of events for a man who is on his fourth marriage . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links katherina reiche 's web site overview of her work .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .

the 89th tour de france will kick off in luxembourg on saturday .
three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .
" everybody else will have to fight it out for second place . "
next to the clear-cut favorite , the spaniards igor gonzalez de galdeano , oscar sevilla and joseba beloki are expected to reach top positions next to mountain-expert santiago botero from columbia and richard virenque from france .
german modesty following the tour cancellation by 1997 tour winner jan ullrich , the german telekom team places high hopes on captain erik zabel , who was awarded the green jersey for the largest overall amount of points obtained in stage victories in the six previous years .
the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "
lightening the workload racing officials have shortened the course by 170 km as a reaction to the scandals , making it the shortest tour since 1905 .
" one can not claim to fight against doping and -lrb- at the same time -rrb- impose increasingly heavier workloads on the riders , " leblanc told the trade magazine cycling world .
" this year , by moving some starting locations , we were able to save on distance to some extent . "
with a decrease in distance comes an increase in drug testing .

with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .
at least the conservatives ’ election team gained a young face , said claudia roth , chief of the greens .
but stoiber , roth said , " has looked very old in the last few days . "

with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .
at least the conservatives ’ election team gained a young face , said claudia roth , chief of the greens .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.07.2002 grueling tour de france kicks off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will it be a tour de lance once again ?
the 89th tour de france will kick off in luxembourg on saturday .
three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .
" everybody else will have to fight it out for second place . "
next to the clear-cut favorite , the spaniards igor gonzalez de galdeano , oscar sevilla and joseba beloki are expected to reach top positions next to mountain-expert santiago botero from columbia and richard virenque from france .
german modesty following the tour cancellation by 1997 tour winner jan ullrich , the german telekom team places high hopes on captain erik zabel , who was awarded the green jersey for the largest overall amount of points obtained in stage victories in the six previous years .
the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "
lightening the workload racing officials have shortened the course by 170 km as a reaction to the scandals , making it the shortest tour since 1905 .

the 89th tour de france will kick off in luxembourg on saturday .
three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .
" everybody else will have to fight it out for second place . "
next to the clear-cut favorite , the spaniards igor gonzalez de galdeano , oscar sevilla and joseba beloki are expected to reach top positions next to mountain-expert santiago botero from columbia and richard virenque from france .
german modesty following the tour cancellation by 1997 tour winner jan ullrich , the german telekom team places high hopes on captain erik zabel , who was awarded the green jersey for the largest overall amount of points obtained in stage victories in the six previous years .
the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "

in germany , meanwhile , public awareness is growing but many young people remain uninformed about risks . when five homosexual men were first detected as having aids in san francisco in 1981 , most put it down to an infection afflicting homosexuals and drug-addicts .
20 years later , hardly anyone would dream of suggesting that .
rapid rise of a killer disease aids has killed more than 20 million since its discovery in 1981 and created 14 million orphans according to the unaids , the agency that co-ordinates the united nations ' aids programs .
today , 40 million people world-wide are infected by the hiv virus ; an estimated 68 million people will die from aids in the developing world over the next 18 years .
questions , problems – where are the answers ?
the 14th international aids conference that kicks off in barcelona on sunday will see 15,000 delegates from all walks of life – scientists , politicians , community workers , aids activists , doctors , donors and counsellors participating in the week-long brainstorming session .
as public awareness of the aids crisis increases and the political momentum to tackle aids grows , delegates will be under pressure to provide answers to what is increasingly being perceived as a global threat .
what can stop the virus ?
what can help people , who are infected with the hiv virus ?
how can the vicious cycle of unsafe sex , poverty , ignorance and lack of political will be broken ?
how can anti-retroviral drugs be made more easily available and affordable for the hiv-infected in developing countries ?
grim reading the latest unaids report published just a week before the conference in spain takes off , underscores the urgency in coming up with a cohesive global action plan .
the report warns that the aids epidemic is still in its early stages and is spreading rapidly throughout africa , asia , the caribbean and eastern europe .
it especially threatens to wipe out a generation in africa and destabilise the whole continent .
of a record 3 million people killed by aids last year , 2.2 million alone were from africa .
dr. peter piot , unaids ' executive director , told reuters the disease was eating away africa ’ s work force , inhibiting economic development and aggravating famines .
aids killer in africa , russia and eastern europe it unaids report reveals that botswana has the highest hiv infection rates in the world , with 39 percent of the adult population now affected .
the epidemic is chiefly spread through heterosexual sex without condoms , life expectancy in botswana has dropped below 40 for the first time since 1950 .
away from africa , the unaids report also warns of epidemics in highly-populated countries like china , indonesia and those in the former soviet-union .
the disease is spreading fastest in russia and eastern europe and is moving from injecting drug users to the wider population .
young people largely ignorant coinciding with the unaids report , a landmark study compiled by the unicef , unaids and the world health organisation which takes a comprehensive look at the behaviour and knowledge relating to hiv / aids of young people aged 15-24 years has thrown up an alarming find .
it says that over 50 percent of young people aged between 15-24 surveyed in 60 countries have no idea how hiv / aids is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
at the same time the study shows that adolescence is the time when the majority of people become sexually active .
un organisations are now calling for aids-related efforts to centre on working with young people to provide them with knowledge about hiv and how to avoid infection .
aids in germany in germany , some 60,000 people have been infected with hiv since the mid-80s .
the berlin-based robert koch institute reports that 19,000 people have died from aids in germany .
while public concern about aids has been waning in recent years , the federal center for health education said recently that this appears to be changing .
since the early 1990s , the agency has backed a series of billboards under the headline " mach ’ s mit " or " do it with " .
the " with " referrring to condoms .
the public is invited to send in suggestions for billboards , which always feature a colored condom as part of the design .
the latest campaign , aimed at reminding people to use condoms while on vacation , is a place-setting with fork , knife and condom-plate under the headline " bed & breakfast " .
the condom manufacturer durex says that about 75 percent of young adults in germany use a condom when having sex for the first time with a new partner .
elisabeth pott , director of the center for health education , attributed increased awareness to this ad campaign .
facts remain murky however , while germans are more aware about aids than in recent years , their knowledge about it remains murky .
a recent survey of german youth showed that 25 percent did not know that an hiv infection is contagious before aids develops and 20 percent of young singles believe that hiv leaves physical marks that are visible on people who are infected .
meanwhile , about 2,000 people are infected with hiv each year in germany , about 1,500 of them men .
in germany , about 50 percent of all new infections come from homosexual contact between men ; 21 percent from immigrants coming from countries with high infection rates ; 18 percent from heterosexual sex ; 10 percent from the use of contaminated needles during drug use and 1 percent from the transfer of the infection from mother to child during pregnancy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links 14th international aids conference barcelona unaids 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "
lightening the workload racing officials have shortened the course by 170 km as a reaction to the scandals , making it the shortest tour since 1905 .
" one can not claim to fight against doping and -lrb- at the same time -rrb- impose increasingly heavier workloads on the riders , " leblanc told the trade magazine cycling world .
" this year , by moving some starting locations , we were able to save on distance to some extent . "

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .

but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .

schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .

both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .

industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

rapid rise of a killer disease aids has killed more than 20 million since its discovery in 1981 and created 14 million orphans according to the unaids , the agency that co-ordinates the united nations ' aids programs .
today , 40 million people world-wide are infected by the hiv virus ; an estimated 68 million people will die from aids in the developing world over the next 18 years .

the 14th international aids conference that kicks off in barcelona on sunday will see 15,000 delegates from all walks of life – scientists , politicians , community workers , aids activists , doctors , donors and counsellors participating in the week-long brainstorming session .
as public awareness of the aids crisis increases and the political momentum to tackle aids grows , delegates will be under pressure to provide answers to what is increasingly being perceived as a global threat .
what can stop the virus ?
what can help people , who are infected with the hiv virus ?
how can the vicious cycle of unsafe sex , poverty , ignorance and lack of political will be broken ?
how can anti-retroviral drugs be made more easily available and affordable for the hiv-infected in developing countries ?
grim reading the latest unaids report published just a week before the conference in spain takes off , underscores the urgency in coming up with a cohesive global action plan .
the report warns that the aids epidemic is still in its early stages and is spreading rapidly throughout africa , asia , the caribbean and eastern europe .
it especially threatens to wipe out a generation in africa and destabilise the whole continent .
of a record 3 million people killed by aids last year , 2.2 million alone were from africa .
dr. peter piot , unaids ' executive director , told reuters the disease was eating away africa ’ s work force , inhibiting economic development and aggravating famines .
aids killer in africa , russia and eastern europe it unaids report reveals that botswana has the highest hiv infection rates in the world , with 39 percent of the adult population now affected .
the epidemic is chiefly spread through heterosexual sex without condoms , life expectancy in botswana has dropped below 40 for the first time since 1950 .
away from africa , the unaids report also warns of epidemics in highly-populated countries like china , indonesia and those in the former soviet-union .
the disease is spreading fastest in russia and eastern europe and is moving from injecting drug users to the wider population .
young people largely ignorant coinciding with the unaids report , a landmark study compiled by the unicef , unaids and the world health organisation which takes a comprehensive look at the behaviour and knowledge relating to hiv / aids of young people aged 15-24 years has thrown up an alarming find .
it says that over 50 percent of young people aged between 15-24 surveyed in 60 countries have no idea how hiv / aids is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
at the same time the study shows that adolescence is the time when the majority of people become sexually active .
un organisations are now calling for aids-related efforts to centre on working with young people to provide them with knowledge about hiv and how to avoid infection .
aids in germany in germany , some 60,000 people have been infected with hiv since the mid-80s .
the berlin-based robert koch institute reports that 19,000 people have died from aids in germany .
while public concern about aids has been waning in recent years , the federal center for health education said recently that this appears to be changing .
since the early 1990s , the agency has backed a series of billboards under the headline " mach ’ s mit " or " do it with " .
the " with " referrring to condoms .
the public is invited to send in suggestions for billboards , which always feature a colored condom as part of the design .
the latest campaign , aimed at reminding people to use condoms while on vacation , is a place-setting with fork , knife and condom-plate under the headline " bed & breakfast " .
the condom manufacturer durex says that about 75 percent of young adults in germany use a condom when having sex for the first time with a new partner .
elisabeth pott , director of the center for health education , attributed increased awareness to this ad campaign .
facts remain murky however , while germans are more aware about aids than in recent years , their knowledge about it remains murky .
a recent survey of german youth showed that 25 percent did not know that an hiv infection is contagious before aids develops and 20 percent of young singles believe that hiv leaves physical marks that are visible on people who are infected .
meanwhile , about 2,000 people are infected with hiv each year in germany , about 1,500 of them men .
in germany , about 50 percent of all new infections come from homosexual contact between men ; 21 percent from immigrants coming from countries with high infection rates ; 18 percent from heterosexual sex ; 10 percent from the use of contaminated needles during drug use and 1 percent from the transfer of the infection from mother to child during pregnancy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links 14th international aids conference barcelona unaids 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the 89th tour de france will kick off in luxembourg on saturday .
three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .
" everybody else will have to fight it out for second place . "
next to the clear-cut favorite , the spaniards igor gonzalez de galdeano , oscar sevilla and joseba beloki are expected to reach top positions next to mountain-expert santiago botero from columbia and richard virenque from france .
german modesty following the tour cancellation by 1997 tour winner jan ullrich , the german telekom team places high hopes on captain erik zabel , who was awarded the green jersey for the largest overall amount of points obtained in stage victories in the six previous years .
the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "
lightening the workload racing officials have shortened the course by 170 km as a reaction to the scandals , making it the shortest tour since 1905 .
" one can not claim to fight against doping and -lrb- at the same time -rrb- impose increasingly heavier workloads on the riders , " leblanc told the trade magazine cycling world .
" this year , by moving some starting locations , we were able to save on distance to some extent . "
with a decrease in distance comes an increase in drug testing .
ten riders will be randomly screened after each of stage of the race . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

how can anti-retroviral drugs be made more easily available and affordable for the hiv-infected in developing countries ?
grim reading the latest unaids report published just a week before the conference in spain takes off , underscores the urgency in coming up with a cohesive global action plan .
the report warns that the aids epidemic is still in its early stages and is spreading rapidly throughout africa , asia , the caribbean and eastern europe .
it especially threatens to wipe out a generation in africa and destabilise the whole continent .
of a record 3 million people killed by aids last year , 2.2 million alone were from africa .
dr. peter piot , unaids ' executive director , told reuters the disease was eating away africa ’ s work force , inhibiting economic development and aggravating famines .
aids killer in africa , russia and eastern europe it unaids report reveals that botswana has the highest hiv infection rates in the world , with 39 percent of the adult population now affected .
the epidemic is chiefly spread through heterosexual sex without condoms , life expectancy in botswana has dropped below 40 for the first time since 1950 .
away from africa , the unaids report also warns of epidemics in highly-populated countries like china , indonesia and those in the former soviet-union .
the disease is spreading fastest in russia and eastern europe and is moving from injecting drug users to the wider population .
young people largely ignorant coinciding with the unaids report , a landmark study compiled by the unicef , unaids and the world health organisation which takes a comprehensive look at the behaviour and knowledge relating to hiv / aids of young people aged 15-24 years has thrown up an alarming find .
it says that over 50 percent of young people aged between 15-24 surveyed in 60 countries have no idea how hiv / aids is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
at the same time the study shows that adolescence is the time when the majority of people become sexually active .
un organisations are now calling for aids-related efforts to centre on working with young people to provide them with knowledge about hiv and how to avoid infection .
aids in germany in germany , some 60,000 people have been infected with hiv since the mid-80s .
the berlin-based robert koch institute reports that 19,000 people have died from aids in germany .
while public concern about aids has been waning in recent years , the federal center for health education said recently that this appears to be changing .
since the early 1990s , the agency has backed a series of billboards under the headline " mach ’ s mit " or " do it with " .
the " with " referrring to condoms .
the public is invited to send in suggestions for billboards , which always feature a colored condom as part of the design .
the latest campaign , aimed at reminding people to use condoms while on vacation , is a place-setting with fork , knife and condom-plate under the headline " bed & breakfast " .
the condom manufacturer durex says that about 75 percent of young adults in germany use a condom when having sex for the first time with a new partner .
elisabeth pott , director of the center for health education , attributed increased awareness to this ad campaign .
facts remain murky however , while germans are more aware about aids than in recent years , their knowledge about it remains murky .
a recent survey of german youth showed that 25 percent did not know that an hiv infection is contagious before aids develops and 20 percent of young singles believe that hiv leaves physical marks that are visible on people who are infected .
meanwhile , about 2,000 people are infected with hiv each year in germany , about 1,500 of them men .
in germany , about 50 percent of all new infections come from homosexual contact between men ; 21 percent from immigrants coming from countries with high infection rates ; 18 percent from heterosexual sex ; 10 percent from the use of contaminated needles during drug use and 1 percent from the transfer of the infection from mother to child during pregnancy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links 14th international aids conference barcelona unaids 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .
at least the conservatives ’ election team gained a young face , said claudia roth , chief of the greens .
but stoiber , roth said , " has looked very old in the last few days . "

with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2002 schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder says the economy will grow as much as 3 percent next year the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .
but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in germany , meanwhile , public awareness is growing but many young people remain uninformed about risks . when five homosexual men were first detected as having aids in san francisco in 1981 , most put it down to an infection afflicting homosexuals and drug-addicts .
20 years later , hardly anyone would dream of suggesting that .
rapid rise of a killer disease aids has killed more than 20 million since its discovery in 1981 and created 14 million orphans according to the unaids , the agency that co-ordinates the united nations ' aids programs .
today , 40 million people world-wide are infected by the hiv virus ; an estimated 68 million people will die from aids in the developing world over the next 18 years .
questions , problems – where are the answers ?
the 14th international aids conference that kicks off in barcelona on sunday will see 15,000 delegates from all walks of life – scientists , politicians , community workers , aids activists , doctors , donors and counsellors participating in the week-long brainstorming session .
as public awareness of the aids crisis increases and the political momentum to tackle aids grows , delegates will be under pressure to provide answers to what is increasingly being perceived as a global threat .
what can stop the virus ?
what can help people , who are infected with the hiv virus ?
how can the vicious cycle of unsafe sex , poverty , ignorance and lack of political will be broken ?
how can anti-retroviral drugs be made more easily available and affordable for the hiv-infected in developing countries ?
grim reading the latest unaids report published just a week before the conference in spain takes off , underscores the urgency in coming up with a cohesive global action plan .
the report warns that the aids epidemic is still in its early stages and is spreading rapidly throughout africa , asia , the caribbean and eastern europe .
it especially threatens to wipe out a generation in africa and destabilise the whole continent .
of a record 3 million people killed by aids last year , 2.2 million alone were from africa .
dr. peter piot , unaids ' executive director , told reuters the disease was eating away africa ’ s work force , inhibiting economic development and aggravating famines .
aids killer in africa , russia and eastern europe it unaids report reveals that botswana has the highest hiv infection rates in the world , with 39 percent of the adult population now affected .
the epidemic is chiefly spread through heterosexual sex without condoms , life expectancy in botswana has dropped below 40 for the first time since 1950 .
away from africa , the unaids report also warns of epidemics in highly-populated countries like china , indonesia and those in the former soviet-union .
the disease is spreading fastest in russia and eastern europe and is moving from injecting drug users to the wider population .
young people largely ignorant coinciding with the unaids report , a landmark study compiled by the unicef , unaids and the world health organisation which takes a comprehensive look at the behaviour and knowledge relating to hiv / aids of young people aged 15-24 years has thrown up an alarming find .
it says that over 50 percent of young people aged between 15-24 surveyed in 60 countries have no idea how hiv / aids is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
at the same time the study shows that adolescence is the time when the majority of people become sexually active .
un organisations are now calling for aids-related efforts to centre on working with young people to provide them with knowledge about hiv and how to avoid infection .
aids in germany in germany , some 60,000 people have been infected with hiv since the mid-80s .
the berlin-based robert koch institute reports that 19,000 people have died from aids in germany .
while public concern about aids has been waning in recent years , the federal center for health education said recently that this appears to be changing .
since the early 1990s , the agency has backed a series of billboards under the headline " mach ’ s mit " or " do it with " .
the " with " referrring to condoms .
the public is invited to send in suggestions for billboards , which always feature a colored condom as part of the design .
the latest campaign , aimed at reminding people to use condoms while on vacation , is a place-setting with fork , knife and condom-plate under the headline " bed & breakfast " .
the condom manufacturer durex says that about 75 percent of young adults in germany use a condom when having sex for the first time with a new partner .
elisabeth pott , director of the center for health education , attributed increased awareness to this ad campaign .
facts remain murky however , while germans are more aware about aids than in recent years , their knowledge about it remains murky .
a recent survey of german youth showed that 25 percent did not know that an hiv infection is contagious before aids develops and 20 percent of young singles believe that hiv leaves physical marks that are visible on people who are infected .
meanwhile , about 2,000 people are infected with hiv each year in germany , about 1,500 of them men .
in germany , about 50 percent of all new infections come from homosexual contact between men ; 21 percent from immigrants coming from countries with high infection rates ; 18 percent from heterosexual sex ; 10 percent from the use of contaminated needles during drug use and 1 percent from the transfer of the infection from mother to child during pregnancy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links 14th international aids conference barcelona unaids 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .
at least the conservatives ’ election team gained a young face , said claudia roth , chief of the greens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2002 schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder says the economy will grow as much as 3 percent next year the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .
but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the epidemic is chiefly spread through heterosexual sex without condoms , life expectancy in botswana has dropped below 40 for the first time since 1950 .
away from africa , the unaids report also warns of epidemics in highly-populated countries like china , indonesia and those in the former soviet-union .
the disease is spreading fastest in russia and eastern europe and is moving from injecting drug users to the wider population .
young people largely ignorant coinciding with the unaids report , a landmark study compiled by the unicef , unaids and the world health organisation which takes a comprehensive look at the behaviour and knowledge relating to hiv / aids of young people aged 15-24 years has thrown up an alarming find .
it says that over 50 percent of young people aged between 15-24 surveyed in 60 countries have no idea how hiv / aids is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
at the same time the study shows that adolescence is the time when the majority of people become sexually active .
un organisations are now calling for aids-related efforts to centre on working with young people to provide them with knowledge about hiv and how to avoid infection .
aids in germany in germany , some 60,000 people have been infected with hiv since the mid-80s .
the berlin-based robert koch institute reports that 19,000 people have died from aids in germany .
while public concern about aids has been waning in recent years , the federal center for health education said recently that this appears to be changing .
since the early 1990s , the agency has backed a series of billboards under the headline " mach ’ s mit " or " do it with " .
the " with " referrring to condoms .
the public is invited to send in suggestions for billboards , which always feature a colored condom as part of the design .
the latest campaign , aimed at reminding people to use condoms while on vacation , is a place-setting with fork , knife and condom-plate under the headline " bed & breakfast " .
the condom manufacturer durex says that about 75 percent of young adults in germany use a condom when having sex for the first time with a new partner .
elisabeth pott , director of the center for health education , attributed increased awareness to this ad campaign .
facts remain murky however , while germans are more aware about aids than in recent years , their knowledge about it remains murky .
a recent survey of german youth showed that 25 percent did not know that an hiv infection is contagious before aids develops and 20 percent of young singles believe that hiv leaves physical marks that are visible on people who are infected .
meanwhile , about 2,000 people are infected with hiv each year in germany , about 1,500 of them men .
in germany , about 50 percent of all new infections come from homosexual contact between men ; 21 percent from immigrants coming from countries with high infection rates ; 18 percent from heterosexual sex ; 10 percent from the use of contaminated needles during drug use and 1 percent from the transfer of the infection from mother to child during pregnancy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links 14th international aids conference barcelona unaids 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.07.2002 who ’ s an expert on family values ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " everyone is their own expert in matters concerning the family , " said katherina reiche as she was appointed by opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber to a key advisory post .
with the german elections drawing near , conservatives are going to battle over chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s choice of an unwed mother as adviser on issues of youth , women and family in his shadow cabinet . at first glance , katherina reiche looks like the quintessential spokeswoman for family values : the 28-year-old member of the german parliament has a toddler , and her second child is due in august .
but this rising star of conservative politics , a chemist who grew up in the former east germany and who joined the christian democrats at age 21 , has provoked an intense debate about just who is qualified to govern family matters .
at the heart of the discussion is the fact that reiche , named on wednesday as opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber 's adviser on youth , women and family matters , is not married .
she lives with her partner , a politician in the state of brandenburg .
" it ’ s clear to us that we will marry , " she said .
" but under no circumstances will i allow others to determine the date . "
traditional german values this came in response to weeks of controversy over the pending appointment , which drew strong criticism from the catholic church and other proponents of traditional german values known as " kinder , küche , kirche , " or " children , cooking , church . "
the opposition within stoiber ’ s own christian social union -lrb- the cdu 's bavarian sister party -rrb- was so strong that stoiber toyed with the idea of removing the responsibility for family politics from the post and asking csu vice chairman horst seehofer , married with three children , to oversee family matters .
that would have left reiche responsible for youth and women .
in deciding to name reiche to the full post after all , stoiber said he is confident that she can represent family interests .
stoiber , who has been married since 1968 and has three children , added that while the majority of german familes are married couples with children , other models must be respected .
families are changing for her part , reiche said that " traditional -lrb- family -rrb- concepts have changed . "
this appointment signifies a new direction for reiche , who has been the cdu ’ s point-person for issues of human genetics and has worked on german-polish relations .
stoiber had originally turned to reiche in an attempt to reach out to women and eastern voters – all weak areas for the bavarian premier .
besides facing criticism from the conservative wing of his own party , stoiber was also blasted by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and alliance 90 / the greens for the debate itself .
spd general secretary franz müntefering referred to the discussion as an " embarrassing brouhaha " about reiche ’ s personal life .
at least the conservatives ’ election team gained a young face , said claudia roth , chief of the greens .
but stoiber , roth said , " has looked very old in the last few days . "
chancellor gerhard schröder seems to gain the most points in the whole debate , which is an interesting turn of events for a man who is on his fourth marriage . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links katherina reiche 's web site overview of her work .

the 89th tour de france will kick off in luxembourg on saturday .
three-time winner lance armstrong is favored a fourth time as the tour tries to shed a troubling recent history of doping scandals . while enthusiasm over the soccer world cup has barely ebbed off , the next international sporting event is just around the corner .
starting this saturday , the 89th tour de france will bring cycling enthusiasts throughout the world to a fever pitch .
for three weeks , fans will cheer their favourites through high speed chases , mountain climbs and time trials all over france .
twenty-one teams with a total of 189 riders will fight it out on 3,276 kilometres of pavement .
next to the tour ’ s renowned alpine and mediterranean scenery , the route this year presents a wide range of challenges to the participants .
dexterity and stamina distinguish favorites riders will need to prove their versatility by ascending the seven mountain stages and staying ahead on the three time trials all the while saving up enough energy for spectacular head-to-head duels before the finishing lines of each of the twenty stages .
as the start draws near , a select handful of favourites are being tipped as possible winners of the coveted maillot jaune , or yellow jersey , for best overall finishing time .
american cycling superstar lance armstrong , who has won the tour de france each of the last three years , is the leader of the pack .
" he ’ s clearly the top favorite , he ranks in a league of his own above all others , " jens voigt of french team credit agricole told dw-tv .
" everybody else will have to fight it out for second place . "
next to the clear-cut favorite , the spaniards igor gonzalez de galdeano , oscar sevilla and joseba beloki are expected to reach top positions next to mountain-expert santiago botero from columbia and richard virenque from france .
german modesty following the tour cancellation by 1997 tour winner jan ullrich , the german telekom team places high hopes on captain erik zabel , who was awarded the green jersey for the largest overall amount of points obtained in stage victories in the six previous years .
the expert sprinter , who is to celebrate his 32nd birthday on sunday , has also placed second in the overall time ranking four times .
aware of the prowess of contenders armstrong and christophe moreau from france , zabel makes a modest estimate of his chances of victory .
" a win would of course be better , but i ’ d be contend to come out second and win the green jersey , " zabel told dw-tv .
a scenic tour de force the race will kick off on saturday with a prologue in the historic town of luxembourg .
from there , the first of a total of twenty stages , each an average of 163.8 kilometres in length , will be fought out throughout the grand douchy of luxembourg .
taking its course counter-clockwise through france , the race can be divided into three distinct phases .
a first week of flat and fast stages across northern france will be followed by two weeks of strenuous mountain climbing in the pyrenees and alps mountains , before the pack makes its final dash towards the finish line in france ’ s capital paris .
since 1975 , the race traditionally ends before cheering crowds on the champs elysees boulevard .
experts expect the race to be decided in the pristine alpine stages , especially the final assault up to the skiing resort les deux alpes , where italian marco pantani took the yellow jersey from german ulrich in 1998 .
it is in the alps that armstrong has also secured his victories in the last three tours .
tour 's drug woes continue the mountains also play a tragic part in the tour ’ s history .
it was on the mount vetoux stage in 1976 that british cyclist tom simpson died after taking amphetamines to cope with the grueling race day . the pattern of drug-taking has repeated itself with alarming frequency in recent years .
in 1998 , the biggest doping scandal in the tour 's history saw the disqualification of an entire team and suspended jail sentences for its director and a medical team member .
three of italy 's top riders - 1998 tour winner pantani , stefano garzelli and gilberto simoni - are banned from this year 's race because of positive drug tests in the past year .
and germany 's telekom team has been tainted by the recent revalation that ullrich , who cancelled on the tour following an injury , has tested positive for amphetamines in an unannounced drug screening following a knee operation in june .
telekom team manager rudy pevenage said he is currently considering dropping the 28-year-old from the team .
pevenage believes ullrich ’ s substance abuse was not sports-related , but rather part of the rider 's troubling decline .
" the sport of cycling is already completely spoiled , " werner franke , a molecular biologist and doping expert recently told german television .
" recent cases can hardly worsen that image . "
lightening the workload racing officials have shortened the course by 170 km as a reaction to the scandals , making it the shortest tour since 1905 .
" one can not claim to fight against doping and -lrb- at the same time -rrb- impose increasingly heavier workloads on the riders , " leblanc told the trade magazine cycling world .
" this year , by moving some starting locations , we were able to save on distance to some extent . "
with a decrease in distance comes an increase in drug testing .
ten riders will be randomly screened after each of stage of the race . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but differences are emerging before the ink is even dry . chancellor gerhard schröder did the expected thursday and placed his support firmly behind a revolutionary labor reform proposal that has been winning him badly-needed points with voters .
the ruling social democrat chancellor , who has been accused of not doing enough to alleviate germany ’ s hefty unemployment problem , praised the as-yet-finished proposals of the hartz commission , which aim to halve unemployment within three years .
" it is not an exaggeration to say that what we have is nothing less than a blueprint for more employment , individual initiative and security , " schröder told germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , on thursday .
the proposals of the commission , headed by schröder friend and volkswagen director peter hartz , seek to streamline the job search process for the unemployed , place a greater emphasis on temporary work agencies and give higher tax incentives to the self-employed .
though the report is first due on august 16 , details have already been leaked and quickly championed by schröder .
with unemployment steady at around 3.95 million according to june figures and his social democrats still behind in the polls , the chancellor is eager to appear reform ready .
but many , including hartz , fear dragging the plan into the election campaign will dash any hopes of it becoming a reality .
how good ideas go bad after initially supporting the plan , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- economic policy pointman in parliament and possible future economics minister , lothar späth , has come out against it .
the union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , along with joint chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , are dead against supporting anything that could win schröder points .
the chancellor has begun narrowing the gap that separates him and the union bloc in public opinion polls since talk of the hartz plan surfaced .
but a recent poll in the newsmagazine der spiegel showed that only 27 percent thought the hartz plan would give schröder ’ s campaign a boost .
the hartz commission is a " good show , " said friedrich merz , the parliamentary group leader for the cdu and csu who has also been suggested as a federal finance minister if the bloc wins a majority after september 22 .
" but it ’ s still a show . "
schröder nevertheless is bent on bringing the hartz plan into effect , somehow , before the national elections .
strange bedfellows to do that , he needs the support of both industry and the unions , who he is depending on for votes .
both have shown themselves supportive , but to varying degrees .
industry leaders have said the hartz plan is a step " in the right direction " but , like many , prefer to wait until the complete report is finished .
michael sommer , chairman of the german trade union association , said he is " ready to discuss " the proposals and saw " positive starting points . "
but the two sides have already begun to disagree on a hartz plan to reduce unemployment payments after one year and cut them off completely two years , leaving the unemployed depending solely on welfare checks .
dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper thursday that the money should be cut off after one year .
the unions are dead against the idea , and their leaders will tell schröder likewise when they meet with him friday .
the unions are generally supportive of the proposals , but say there is much work yet to be done .
those on the commission seem to agree , and they are getting annoyed that schröder has decided to throw the proposals into the campaign ring before they are fully developed .
hartz said that , when they are released , the proposals could be brought into effect by any party , " no matter who governs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in germany , meanwhile , public awareness is growing but many young people remain uninformed about risks . when five homosexual men were first detected as having aids in san francisco in 1981 , most put it down to an infection afflicting homosexuals and drug-addicts .
20 years later , hardly anyone would dream of suggesting that .
rapid rise of a killer disease aids has killed more than 20 million since its discovery in 1981 and created 14 million orphans according to the unaids , the agency that co-ordinates the united nations ' aids programs .

sir anthony grabham , speaking in a personal capacity at the bma conference in harrogate , said one-third of the nhs was of high quality , the second reasonably good but the lowest third was of great concern .
he also said he doubted whether all the new money promised by the government to the nhs would ever materialise .
sir anthony argued that after half a century of underfunding , it was time to look at other possible ways of funding health care . "
we are in terms of availability verging on third world medicine in what is one of the most affluent countries in the world " sir anthony grabham " i am not so sure that all of the promised increased funding will appear - or not in the promised timescale , " he said .
" i am not imputing bad faith to the chancellor but inevitably , one remembers that politicians do sometimes change their minds .
" i remain somewhat sceptical about the value of these promises - we 'll have to see and i still suspect that a different model of healthcare provision will have to be looked at some time in the future . "
' stressed ' doctors sir anthony , who became a consultant general surgeon in 1965 and has held many posts in the bma , said : " there is much good in the nhs but there are also terrible problems . "
it was unacceptable to have one million people facing long waits for operations , and for elderly people to be using their life savings to pay for private operations , he said . "
alongside the many good nhs hospitals , we know there are some that could do better " department of health " looking at this lowest third of nhs performance , we are in terms of availability verging on third world medicine in what is one of the most affluent countries in the world , " he said .
pressures on doctors were also becoming terrible .
" all over the country there are doctors who are anxious , stressed , overworked and demoralised because they ca n't look after their patients properly , " he said .
he called on the government to stop manipulating the figures and start facing up to the problems in the service .
the government should " accept honestly and openly that some form of rationing and delay is inevitable in an under funded service , " he said .
10-year plan responding to the speech , a department of health spokesman said : " if the bma does not believe the extra billions of pounds we are spending on the nhs can deliver results , why have they recommended that their consultants accept a new pay deal based on that same investment programme ?
" alongside the many good nhs hospitals , we know there are some that could do better .
" we have a 10-year plan for investment and reform .
we have more beds , more nurses and more doctors .
there is some way to go , but a good start has been made . "

the government suffered a total of three defeats , with peers initially rejecting plans to allow school governing bodies to form companies .
they also backed conservative proposals to cut red tape in schools .
the third defeat came over a liberal democrat amendment to get rid of school forums , which had been proposed under the bill .
unaccountable ?
lib dem peer baroness walmsley condemned the forums as " unelected and unaccountable " .
with parliament 's long summer break looming , ministers will now have to find time to reverse the defeats before the commons recess on 24 july .
but even if they manage to send the bill back to the lords , peers may be unwilling to compromise .
the legislation proposes the deregulation of schools , freeing head teachers so they can be more " innovative " .
the bill also provides for bonus payments for teachers at top-performing schools .
productive partnership ?
tory former education spokesman baroness blatch said the power for schools to join together to form companies would be " a recipe for chaos " .
for the government , lord mcintosh insisted school companies would operate in a " positive , productive partnership " with their local education authorities .
a spokesman from the department of education said that the lords ' amendments would be reconsidered in the commons , but gave no indication as to how the government would proceed .
