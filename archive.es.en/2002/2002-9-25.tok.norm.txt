after being banned for 19 months because of the disease , the first carcases for export are leaving from the st merryn meat plant in merthyr tydfil bound for holland .
but the container load is being deliberately labelled " welsh " instead of " british " in an attempt to beat the stigma attached to british beef .
earlier this week , welsh beef exporters were given a lift when the french food standards agency recommended dropping a lengthy ban on uk imports , imposed amid fears about bse .
producers have lost millions of pounds in orders to countries such as france and holland , following the collapse of the export market .
mr german earlier stamped the first batch of beef to be processed under the new date based export scheme -lrb- dbes -rrb- .
cattle from farms across wales will now be processed , ready for shipment to the netherlands next week .
for the first time , the beef will be stamped as welsh rather than british .
john dracup , of st merryn meat , said the consignment was a " major step forward " .
mr german added : " it is important for us in wales to be able to label the beef , so that just as angus beef has become known round the world , so will welsh beef . "
mike thomas , of welsh lamb and beef promotions , said : " we have the safest beef in the world and it is a comfortable feeling knowing we have been through such rigorous tests . "
the beef industry in wales was only just recovering from the bse crisis - exporting £ 10m of beef during the year 2000 - when the foot-and-mouth outbreak struck .
farmers ' union of wales and national farmers ' union cymru have welcomed the move , believing a welsh stamp on joints of beef will prove crucial to reviving the lucrative export market .
fuw president bob parry hopes welsh beef will begin to make a major comeback in france when exhibitors attend a key food event in paris next month .

he said the october 24 paris food fayre was a key stepping stone for welsh beef exports .
and nfu cymru president peredur hughes said france now had no other option but to lift the ban .
there have been no exports of beef up to now from britain since february 2001 , following the £ 8bn farming crisis .
the st merryn plant , which employs 1,000 workers , has become the first in the country to meet new european requirements enabling it to process beef for export .
export market now the industry is hoping to resurrect its trade with other european countries .
the export of 2,466 live lambs through dover to holland marked a significant breakthrough for the rural economy .
around two million lambs were exported from wales annually before the foot-and-mouth crisis , a trade worth around £ 100m per year .
the export of live animals from the uk was suspended during last year 's foot-and-mouth crisis in an effort to prevent the disease spreading to the continent .
the ban on sheep and pig exports was lifted earlier this year and a shipment of pigs for breeding has already taken place .

parents are increasingly missing out on watching their children grow up because of long working hours .
a snapshot of britain , carried out by the joseph rowntree foundation , has found that nearly half of all fathers are putting in long hours at the expense of their family life .
for many people , mums as well as dads , a 9-5 job simply no longer exists , it found .
breakfast talked to one father and son about the impact that working long hours has had on their relationship .
details the survey on working fathers coincides with a separate study , which has discovered that many women still put their careers on the back burner when they have children .
nearly one third of women have downgraded career expectations after childbirth , a chartered institute of personnel and development report said .
by contrast only 19 % of men said their career was no longer on track after becoming a father .
the reports have been released as part of work-life balance week , which is designed to campaign for better working conditions and promote flexible employment .
career aspirations more than half of those surveyed by the cipd said they had switched roles or jobs after becoming a parent .
if you have moved jobs , why did you leave ?
family commitments : male -lrb- 12 % -rrb- , female -lrb- 28 % -rrb- more flexibility / convenience : male -lrb- 9 % -rrb- , female -lrb- 28 % -rrb- career progress : male -lrb- 44 % -rrb- , female -lrb- 17 % -rrb- other : male -lrb- 35 % -rrb- , female -lrb- 28 % -rrb- source : cipd just under a third changed from full-time to part-time hours , while 14 % stopped work completely .
a further 13 % made some other change to their hours , for example , by switching to a four-day working week .
women were three times more likely to change their work patterns than men , with only 26 % continuing to work the same hours as previously .
birth change according to the joseph rowntree foundation , parents in professional jobs were in a better position to adjust their working arrangements to suit their career aspirations and family needs .
parents from lower-income groups were more likely to say they have no scope to negotiate more flexible arrangements .
in april 2003 , parents with young children will have the right to put their case for flexible working arrangements to employers , but researchers said many families would miss out .
ivana la valle , a co-author of the joseph rowntree foundation study , said : " low-income families may feel they simply can not afford to exercise their new ' right ' .
" their need to enhance their take-home pay by working overtime and atypical hours is a major constraint on their ability to achieve a better balance between work and family life . "
childcare costs cipd 's survey backed up the foundation 's findings .
as many as 57 % of parents in households earning over £ 40,000 a year were still working the same hours , the report said .
lower earners - those households earning less than £ 20,000 a year - were most likely to stop work completely , possibly because of childcare costs .
four out of 10 parents felt childcare provision in the uk was poor .
stressed out having children was viewed as a major source of stress by parents .
as many as 80 % of britons said that having children increased stress levels - either slightly or considerably .
but stress levels did not seem to be affected by working status : parents who were working full-time experienced similar stress levels to those who had given up work to raise a family .
the little time parents spent together as a couple was the main casualty of modern working arrangements , the joseph rowntree foundation said .
