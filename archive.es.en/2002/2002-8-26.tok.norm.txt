but many of those involved already see storm clouds looming on the horizon . the notable absence of us president george w. bush has caused for furor in the days leading up to the summit .
bush , who said he has to focus on security and economic concerns with sept .
11 coming up , will send secretary of state colin powell instead . the move amounts to a snub for the international leaders who tried to convince him to come along . the united nations is said to have moved the date of the summit forward to end on september 4th , before the the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , so bush could be present . common environmental policy : going , going ... europe is also feeling slighted .
the past two years have seen an immense rift develop between washington and the european union on environmental policy . beginning with america 's withdrawal from the kyoto protocol , which seeks to curb greenhouse gas emissions , in 2001 the eu and the us have seen hopes of a common environmental policy drift further and further away . in june , at a preparatory ministerial meeting in bali , disagreements over setting concrete targets for protecting the environment from the effects of industrial development led to deadlock between european and us delegates . the eu 's focus on setting timetables and targets does n't gel with washington , which says it needs more time to examine the problem of global warming .
the bush administration has said that it will take at least five years before it can complete research into global warming and finalize a strategy of its own . until then , the administration is loathe to shoulder any treaty that could , in its view , harm the us economy . " the kyoto protocol would have cost our economy up to $ 400 billion -lrb- 412.3 billion euro -rrb- and caused the loss of up to 4.9 million jobs , " james connaughton , chairman of the white house council on environmental quality , told reporters . the stance has caused for unrest and exasperation among the european union 's allies .
the 15-member union wants a common policy that provides water and sanitation for half the roughly 2.4 billion people who are currently without it by 2015 . but the us says it prefers a policy that would leave it up to countries to decide on their own environmental standards . us has a plan , says delegation head the head of the us delegation , under secretary of state john turner said the us was not interested in timetables that were " no more than lofty aspirations that sit somewhere in the rafters at the un . " we are talking about providing real dollars for real projects , " he said , referring to the large number of partnerships between governments , businesses and projects in developing countries which are a feature of the summit . he added that the us had a well-thought-out plan of action to relieve poverty and promote sustainable development . " the united states is committed to building a world where children can grow up free from hunger , disease and illiteracy , " powell said last week .
" a world where all men and women can reach their human potential free from racial or gender discrimination , and a world where people can enjoy the richness of a diverse and healthy planet .

but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , this resource is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s north west province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .
it simply gives people another choice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the u.n. summit in johannesburg has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

but many of those involved already see storm clouds looming on the horizon . the notable absence of us president george w. bush has caused for furor in the days leading up to the summit .
bush , who said he has to focus on security and economic concerns with sept .
11 coming up , will send secretary of state colin powell instead . the move amounts to a snub for the international leaders who tried to convince him to come along . the united nations is said to have moved the date of the summit forward to end on september 4th , before the the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , so bush could be present . common environmental policy : going , going ... europe is also feeling slighted .
the past two years have seen an immense rift develop between washington and the european union on environmental policy . beginning with america 's withdrawal from the kyoto protocol , which seeks to curb greenhouse gas emissions , in 2001 the eu and the us have seen hopes of a common environmental policy drift further and further away . in june , at a preparatory ministerial meeting in bali , disagreements over setting concrete targets for protecting the environment from the effects of industrial development led to deadlock between european and us delegates . the eu 's focus on setting timetables and targets does n't gel with washington , which says it needs more time to examine the problem of global warming .
the bush administration has said that it will take at least five years before it can complete research into global warming and finalize a strategy of its own . until then , the administration is loathe to shoulder any treaty that could , in its view , harm the us economy . " the kyoto protocol would have cost our economy up to $ 400 billion -lrb- 412.3 billion euro -rrb- and caused the loss of up to 4.9 million jobs , " james connaughton , chairman of the white house council on environmental quality , told reporters . the stance has caused for unrest and exasperation among the european union 's allies .
the 15-member union wants a common policy that provides water and sanitation for half the roughly 2.4 billion people who are currently without it by 2015 . but the us says it prefers a policy that would leave it up to countries to decide on their own environmental standards . us has a plan , says delegation head the head of the us delegation , under secretary of state john turner said the us was not interested in timetables that were " no more than lofty aspirations that sit somewhere in the rafters at the un . " we are talking about providing real dollars for real projects , " he said , referring to the large number of partnerships between governments , businesses and projects in developing countries which are a feature of the summit . he added that the us had a well-thought-out plan of action to relieve poverty and promote sustainable development . " the united states is committed to building a world where children can grow up free from hunger , disease and illiteracy , " powell said last week .
" a world where all men and women can reach their human potential free from racial or gender discrimination , and a world where people can enjoy the richness of a diverse and healthy planet . " observers say the absence of bush and the somewhat maverick us stance on environmental subjects will give the first sessions of the summit little form or substance .
compromises on key issues might have to be deferred until world leaders meet on the final two days , according to delegates . " this conference is an acid test of whether multinationalism works - whether we can get actions which provide development opportunity for the poor on clean water , sanitation and energy supplies , ” said ralf fücks , president of the heinrich böll foundation , a german think tank , told the british daily the guardian . the alternative , he said , is unilateralism and " national egotism .

but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , this resource is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s north west province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .

in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .

the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .

the past two years have seen an immense rift develop between washington and the european union on environmental policy . beginning with america 's withdrawal from the kyoto protocol , which seeks to curb greenhouse gas emissions , in 2001 the eu and the us have seen hopes of a common environmental policy drift further and further away . in june , at a preparatory ministerial meeting in bali , disagreements over setting concrete targets for protecting the environment from the effects of industrial development led to deadlock between european and us delegates . the eu 's focus on setting timetables and targets does n't gel with washington , which says it needs more time to examine the problem of global warming .
the bush administration has said that it will take at least five years before it can complete research into global warming and finalize a strategy of its own . until then , the administration is loathe to shoulder any treaty that could , in its view , harm the us economy . " the kyoto protocol would have cost our economy up to $ 400 billion -lrb- 412.3 billion euro -rrb- and caused the loss of up to 4.9 million jobs , " james connaughton , chairman of the white house council on environmental quality , told reporters . the stance has caused for unrest and exasperation among the european union 's allies .
the 15-member union wants a common policy that provides water and sanitation for half the roughly 2.4 billion people who are currently without it by 2015 . but the us says it prefers a policy that would leave it up to countries to decide on their own environmental standards . us has a plan , says delegation head the head of the us delegation , under secretary of state john turner said the us was not interested in timetables that were " no more than lofty aspirations that sit somewhere in the rafters at the un . " we are talking about providing real dollars for real projects , " he said , referring to the large number of partnerships between governments , businesses and projects in developing countries which are a feature of the summit . he added that the us had a well-thought-out plan of action to relieve poverty and promote sustainable development . " the united states is committed to building a world where children can grow up free from hunger , disease and illiteracy , " powell said last week .
" a world where all men and women can reach their human potential free from racial or gender discrimination , and a world where people can enjoy the richness of a diverse and healthy planet . " observers say the absence of bush and the somewhat maverick us stance on environmental subjects will give the first sessions of the summit little form or substance .
compromises on key issues might have to be deferred until world leaders meet on the final two days , according to delegates . " this conference is an acid test of whether multinationalism works - whether we can get actions which provide development opportunity for the poor on clean water , sanitation and energy supplies , ” said ralf fücks , president of the heinrich böll foundation , a german think tank , told the british daily the guardian . the alternative , he said , is unilateralism and " national egotism .

but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , this resource is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s north west province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "

but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , this resource is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s north west province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "

but many of those involved already see storm clouds looming on the horizon . the notable absence of us president george w. bush has caused for furor in the days leading up to the summit .
bush , who said he has to focus on security and economic concerns with sept .
11 coming up , will send secretary of state colin powell instead . the move amounts to a snub for the international leaders who tried to convince him to come along . the united nations is said to have moved the date of the summit forward to end on september 4th , before the the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , so bush could be present . common environmental policy : going , going ... europe is also feeling slighted .
the past two years have seen an immense rift develop between washington and the european union on environmental policy . beginning with america 's withdrawal from the kyoto protocol , which seeks to curb greenhouse gas emissions , in 2001 the eu and the us have seen hopes of a common environmental policy drift further and further away . in june , at a preparatory ministerial meeting in bali , disagreements over setting concrete targets for protecting the environment from the effects of industrial development led to deadlock between european and us delegates . the eu 's focus on setting timetables and targets does n't gel with washington , which says it needs more time to examine the problem of global warming .
the bush administration has said that it will take at least five years before it can complete research into global warming and finalize a strategy of its own . until then , the administration is loathe to shoulder any treaty that could , in its view , harm the us economy . " the kyoto protocol would have cost our economy up to $ 400 billion -lrb- 412.3 billion euro -rrb- and caused the loss of up to 4.9 million jobs , " james connaughton , chairman of the white house council on environmental quality , told reporters . the stance has caused for unrest and exasperation among the european union 's allies .
the 15-member union wants a common policy that provides water and sanitation for half the roughly 2.4 billion people who are currently without it by 2015 . but the us says it prefers a policy that would leave it up to countries to decide on their own environmental standards . us has a plan , says delegation head the head of the us delegation , under secretary of state john turner said the us was not interested in timetables that were " no more than lofty aspirations that sit somewhere in the rafters at the un . " we are talking about providing real dollars for real projects , " he said , referring to the large number of partnerships between governments , businesses and projects in developing countries which are a feature of the summit . he added that the us had a well-thought-out plan of action to relieve poverty and promote sustainable development . " the united states is committed to building a world where children can grow up free from hunger , disease and illiteracy , " powell said last week .
" a world where all men and women can reach their human potential free from racial or gender discrimination , and a world where people can enjoy the richness of a diverse and healthy planet .

the past two years have seen an immense rift develop between washington and the european union on environmental policy . beginning with america 's withdrawal from the kyoto protocol , which seeks to curb greenhouse gas emissions , in 2001 the eu and the us have seen hopes of a common environmental policy drift further and further away . in june , at a preparatory ministerial meeting in bali , disagreements over setting concrete targets for protecting the environment from the effects of industrial development led to deadlock between european and us delegates . the eu 's focus on setting timetables and targets does n't gel with washington , which says it needs more time to examine the problem of global warming .
the bush administration has said that it will take at least five years before it can complete research into global warming and finalize a strategy of its own . until then , the administration is loathe to shoulder any treaty that could , in its view , harm the us economy . " the kyoto protocol would have cost our economy up to $ 400 billion -lrb- 412.3 billion euro -rrb- and caused the loss of up to 4.9 million jobs , " james connaughton , chairman of the white house council on environmental quality , told reporters . the stance has caused for unrest and exasperation among the european union 's allies .
the 15-member union wants a common policy that provides water and sanitation for half the roughly 2.4 billion people who are currently without it by 2015 . but the us says it prefers a policy that would leave it up to countries to decide on their own environmental standards . us has a plan , says delegation head the head of the us delegation , under secretary of state john turner said the us was not interested in timetables that were " no more than lofty aspirations that sit somewhere in the rafters at the un . " we are talking about providing real dollars for real projects , " he said , referring to the large number of partnerships between governments , businesses and projects in developing countries which are a feature of the summit . he added that the us had a well-thought-out plan of action to relieve poverty and promote sustainable development . " the united states is committed to building a world where children can grow up free from hunger , disease and illiteracy , " powell said last week .
" a world where all men and women can reach their human potential free from racial or gender discrimination , and a world where people can enjoy the richness of a diverse and healthy planet . " observers say the absence of bush and the somewhat maverick us stance on environmental subjects will give the first sessions of the summit little form or substance .
compromises on key issues might have to be deferred until world leaders meet on the final two days , according to delegates . " this conference is an acid test of whether multinationalism works - whether we can get actions which provide development opportunity for the poor on clean water , sanitation and energy supplies , ” said ralf fücks , president of the heinrich böll foundation , a german think tank , told the british daily the guardian . the alternative , he said , is unilateralism and " national egotism .

but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , this resource is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s north west province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .

but many of those involved already see storm clouds looming on the horizon . the notable absence of us president george w. bush has caused for furor in the days leading up to the summit .

but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , this resource is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s north west province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .

but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , this resource is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s north west province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "

but many of those involved already see storm clouds looming on the horizon . the notable absence of us president george w. bush has caused for furor in the days leading up to the summit .
bush , who said he has to focus on security and economic concerns with sept .
11 coming up , will send secretary of state colin powell instead . the move amounts to a snub for the international leaders who tried to convince him to come along . the united nations is said to have moved the date of the summit forward to end on september 4th , before the the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , so bush could be present . common environmental policy : going , going ... europe is also feeling slighted .
the past two years have seen an immense rift develop between washington and the european union on environmental policy . beginning with america 's withdrawal from the kyoto protocol , which seeks to curb greenhouse gas emissions , in 2001 the eu and the us have seen hopes of a common environmental policy drift further and further away . in june , at a preparatory ministerial meeting in bali , disagreements over setting concrete targets for protecting the environment from the effects of industrial development led to deadlock between european and us delegates . the eu 's focus on setting timetables and targets does n't gel with washington , which says it needs more time to examine the problem of global warming .
the bush administration has said that it will take at least five years before it can complete research into global warming and finalize a strategy of its own . until then , the administration is loathe to shoulder any treaty that could , in its view , harm the us economy . " the kyoto protocol would have cost our economy up to $ 400 billion -lrb- 412.3 billion euro -rrb- and caused the loss of up to 4.9 million jobs , " james connaughton , chairman of the white house council on environmental quality , told reporters . the stance has caused for unrest and exasperation among the european union 's allies .
the 15-member union wants a common policy that provides water and sanitation for half the roughly 2.4 billion people who are currently without it by 2015 . but the us says it prefers a policy that would leave it up to countries to decide on their own environmental standards . us has a plan , says delegation head the head of the us delegation , under secretary of state john turner said the us was not interested in timetables that were " no more than lofty aspirations that sit somewhere in the rafters at the un . " we are talking about providing real dollars for real projects , " he said , referring to the large number of partnerships between governments , businesses and projects in developing countries which are a feature of the summit . he added that the us had a well-thought-out plan of action to relieve poverty and promote sustainable development . " the united states is committed to building a world where children can grow up free from hunger , disease and illiteracy , " powell said last week .
" a world where all men and women can reach their human potential free from racial or gender discrimination , and a world where people can enjoy the richness of a diverse and healthy planet . " observers say the absence of bush and the somewhat maverick us stance on environmental subjects will give the first sessions of the summit little form or substance .
compromises on key issues might have to be deferred until world leaders meet on the final two days , according to delegates . " this conference is an acid test of whether multinationalism works - whether we can get actions which provide development opportunity for the poor on clean water , sanitation and energy supplies , ” said ralf fücks , president of the heinrich böll foundation , a german think tank , told the british daily the guardian . the alternative , he said , is unilateralism and " national egotism .

germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .

but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , this resource is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s north west province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "

people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s north west province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .

in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .

but many of those involved already see storm clouds looming on the horizon . the notable absence of us president george w. bush has caused for furor in the days leading up to the summit .
bush , who said he has to focus on security and economic concerns with sept .
11 coming up , will send secretary of state colin powell instead . the move amounts to a snub for the international leaders who tried to convince him to come along . the united nations is said to have moved the date of the summit forward to end on september 4th , before the the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , so bush could be present . common environmental policy : going , going ... europe is also feeling slighted .
the past two years have seen an immense rift develop between washington and the european union on environmental policy . beginning with america 's withdrawal from the kyoto protocol , which seeks to curb greenhouse gas emissions , in 2001 the eu and the us have seen hopes of a common environmental policy drift further and further away . in june , at a preparatory ministerial meeting in bali , disagreements over setting concrete targets for protecting the environment from the effects of industrial development led to deadlock between european and us delegates . the eu 's focus on setting timetables and targets does n't gel with washington , which says it needs more time to examine the problem of global warming .
the bush administration has said that it will take at least five years before it can complete research into global warming and finalize a strategy of its own . until then , the administration is loathe to shoulder any treaty that could , in its view , harm the us economy . " the kyoto protocol would have cost our economy up to $ 400 billion -lrb- 412.3 billion euro -rrb- and caused the loss of up to 4.9 million jobs , " james connaughton , chairman of the white house council on environmental quality , told reporters . the stance has caused for unrest and exasperation among the european union 's allies .
the 15-member union wants a common policy that provides water and sanitation for half the roughly 2.4 billion people who are currently without it by 2015 . but the us says it prefers a policy that would leave it up to countries to decide on their own environmental standards . us has a plan , says delegation head the head of the us delegation , under secretary of state john turner said the us was not interested in timetables that were " no more than lofty aspirations that sit somewhere in the rafters at the un . " we are talking about providing real dollars for real projects , " he said , referring to the large number of partnerships between governments , businesses and projects in developing countries which are a feature of the summit . he added that the us had a well-thought-out plan of action to relieve poverty and promote sustainable development . " the united states is committed to building a world where children can grow up free from hunger , disease and illiteracy , " powell said last week .
" a world where all men and women can reach their human potential free from racial or gender discrimination , and a world where people can enjoy the richness of a diverse and healthy planet . " observers say the absence of bush and the somewhat maverick us stance on environmental subjects will give the first sessions of the summit little form or substance .
compromises on key issues might have to be deferred until world leaders meet on the final two days , according to delegates . " this conference is an acid test of whether multinationalism works - whether we can get actions which provide development opportunity for the poor on clean water , sanitation and energy supplies , ” said ralf fücks , president of the heinrich böll foundation , a german think tank , told the british daily the guardian . the alternative , he said , is unilateralism and " national egotism .

but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , this resource is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa , and many households are turning to the sun to prepare their food .
solar cookers are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s north west province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .

in the second of his reports he notes that there is little to stop protesters stepping in to set the agenda .
there is a strange feeling in johannesburg at the moment , with nobody quite sure what to expect as the sustainable development summit finally lumbers into formal life .
it must be one of the oddest conferences i 've ever covered . "
protesters are happy to fill the official vacuum with their answer to the global economy - and that answer involves business going a lot further than it already has to reduce its impact on nature " partly that 's because of what is on the agenda , and partly it 's on account of what does n't figure there .
first , let 's take the probable glaring omission .
there is no big headline-grabbing agreement or convention up for signature here .
it looks at the moment as if the best anyone can hope for is a fairly milk-and-water statement exhorting us all to do more about poverty .
so that leaves a vacuum , inviting anyone to step in .
focus of protest enter one key agenda item , which looks likely to get more of an airing on the streets than in the conference centre : globalisation .
it is down for discussion , but you 'd be hard put to find anyone who expects radical decisions from the conference here - or any decisions , probably - on making industries that span continents answer to national governments .
that does n't mean globalisation will go unnoticed , though .
it has already been the focus of protest , and it looks set to bring more protesters out , conscious of the chain they see linking seattle , gothenburg , genoa - and now johannesburg . "
the rainbow nation is turning grey around the edges , and many of us are not quite sure what to hope for any more " they are happy to fill the official vacuum with their answer to the global economy .
and that answer involves business going a lot further than it already has - or perhaps can , if we want to go on living the lives we do - to reduce its impact on nature .
on saturday i met two police officers in a lift , both enjoying ice-creams .
when i said they seemed very relaxed , one replied that it was going to be a quiet and peaceful summit .
two hours later his colleagues were firing stun grenades at protestors a few miles away .
on sunday even the police horses were picking their way round the conference centre complete with protective headgear .
faded hopes another presence is also waiting in the summit 's wings - zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe .
how much attention he may get , and what influence he may have on the agenda , no-one can yet say .
but many south africans are dismayed at the turn events have taken across their northern frontier , so zimbabwe will be hard to ignore .
perhaps the biggest difference between the 1992 rio earth summit and the johannesburg 2002 development summit is the withering of hope .
then the fall of the berlin wall and the overnight evaporation of the cold war were recent memories .
the day was discernibly close when the last apartheid president , f w de klerk , would hand power to nelson mandela in a speech which he ended with the words of the new south african national anthem - nkosi sikeleli afrika , god bless africa .
now , though , new enemies have been defined .

in the second of his reports he notes that there is little to stop protesters stepping in to set the agenda .
there is a strange feeling in johannesburg at the moment , with nobody quite sure what to expect as the sustainable development summit finally lumbers into formal life .
it must be one of the oddest conferences i 've ever covered .
protesters are happy to fill the official vacuum with their answer to the global economy - and that answer involves business going a lot further than it already has to reduce its impact on nature partly that 's because of what is on the agenda , and partly it 's on account of what does n't figure there .
first , let 's take the probable glaring omission .
there is no big headline-grabbing agreement or convention up for signature here .
it looks at the moment as if the best anyone can hope for is a fairly milk-and-water statement exhorting us all to do more about poverty .
so that leaves a vacuum , inviting anyone to step in .
focus of protest enter one key agenda item , which looks likely to get more of an airing on the streets than in the conference centre : globalisation .
it is down for discussion , but you 'd be hard put to find anyone who expects radical decisions from the conference here - or any decisions , probably - on making industries that span continents answer to national governments .
that does n't mean globalisation will go unnoticed , though .
it has already been the focus of protest , and it looks set to bring more protesters out , conscious of the chain they see linking seattle , gothenburg , genoa - and now johannesburg .
the rainbow nation is turning grey around the edges , and many of us are not quite sure what to hope for any more they are happy to fill the official vacuum with their answer to the global economy .
and that answer involves business going a lot further than it already has - or perhaps can , if we want to go on living the lives we do - to reduce its impact on nature .
on saturday i met two police officers in a lift , both enjoying ice-creams .
when i said they seemed very relaxed , one replied that it was going to be a quiet and peaceful summit .
two hours later his colleagues were firing stun grenades at protestors a few miles away .
on sunday even the police horses were picking their way round the conference centre complete with protective headgear .
faded hopes another presence is also waiting in the summit 's wings - zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe .
how much attention he may get , and what influence he may have on the agenda , no-one can yet say .
but many south africans are dismayed at the turn events have taken across their northern frontier , so zimbabwe will be hard to ignore .
perhaps the biggest difference between the 1992 rio earth summit and the johannesburg 2002 development summit is the withering of hope .
then the fall of the berlin wall and the overnight evaporation of the cold war were recent memories .
the day was discernibly close when the last apartheid president , f w de klerk , would hand power to nelson mandela in a speech which he ended with the words of the new south african national anthem - nkosi sikeleli afrika , god bless africa .
now , though , new enemies have been defined .
now the rainbow nation is turning grey around the edges .
and many of us are not quite sure what to hope for any more .

jonathon porritt , who chairs the uk 's sustainable development commission , said the government 's domestic record on the issue is seriously lacking and he accused the prime minister of " naive adulation " of the business world .
his criticism comes as mr blair prepares to address the world development summit in johannesburg .
mr porritt , a former head of friends of the earth-uk , is now programme director of forum for the future , which works on ways to promote sustainable living .
he told the bbc 's breakfast with frost programme the leadership in this area was " patchy , piecemeal , incremental and not done on a strategic level " .
he added : " if you compare that leadership on sustainable development with the kind of leadership we have seen from this government on northern ireland , on health issues and on public services in general , we are talking about a different league of leadership . "
' deplorable ' and in an interview with british sunday newspaper , the observer , he said sustainable development has not been a central concern of mr blair 's .
mr porritt said : " it 's demeaning and dead bad for democracy to see any government so uncritically endorsing corporate perspectives on the global economy , or on the best way of alleviating poverty . "
mr porritt described the government 's performance on domestic environmental issues as deeply flawed .
he said : " there are really serious areas where their performance has been deplorable .
" on transport and waste management they have made no progress at all in the five years since labour was in power .
" there just has n't been the level of quality leadership needed on these two difficult areas . "
but by comparison with most other european countries , he said , the uk had made creditable strides on tackling climate change , increasing development aid , and giving a lead on debt relief for the poorest countries .
he also praised british efforts to transform the european union 's common agricultural policy .
compared with previous uk governments , mr porritt said , this was the best on sustainable development , and among a handful which could report environmental progress since the 1992 rio earth summit .
countering his accusations , environment secretary margaret beckett , on her way to head up the uk delegation at the summit , said that mr blair was " actively involved " in policies on sustainable development .
she told the bbc1 breakfast with frost programme : " mr blair - yes ok , he will not be in johannesburg for all the detailed negotiations , that 's not his job .
he 's there to put the final seal on it .
" but he 's been working on these issues for a year , 18 months and more , and very actively so , and promoting initiatives that are britain 's own specific speciality in terms of energy , water and so on . "
' corporate accountability ' the organisers of the world summit on sustainable development , which starts on monday , hope it will find a way to tackle the abject poverty of millions of people while conserving the world 's natural resources .
the sceptics fear it may prove at best a talking-shop , and possibly a diplomatic disaster .
british officials say they are cautiously hopeful , but they pointedly refuse to speculate on the prospects for success .
mike childs , earth summit coordinator for friends of the earth said mr blair could " start showing some leadership by going to the earth summit earlier and staying longer , rather than just popping by for five minutes " .
" he could also commit the government to supporting the call for a corporate accountability treaty to prevent the social and environmental damage being causing by some multi-nationals , " he added .

once it 's on the net , your life may not be your own .
to the well worn maxim that some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them , we must add a new category .
some , unlucky ones , have it bestowed upon them by the internet .
spread through e-mail recommendation all it takes is the forwarding of an e-mail to your friends or the mention of a good idea and suddenly you can find yourself the leader of an international movement .
it 's impossible to predict what will prove popular , largely because the net is usually as capricious as a spoilt debutante - hard to court but easy to catch the eye of .
and when net fame does strike , it is not always welcome .
writes and wrongs a case in point is web designer matt jones , the man responsible for how bbc news online looked when it launched .
since then , he has invented " warchalking " , which he recently described as a " curse " .
ca n't talk now , got a website to update - matt jones warchalking involves inscribing chalk symbols on a pavement or wall to reveal the existence of a wireless network node that anyone can use .
before mr jones knew , it the idea was being mentioned on hundreds of weblogs , was written up by the web , not least dot.life.
then the printed press followed , and he found himself appearing on television and radio .
it utterly disrupted his life and became a burden rather than a pleasure to be involved with .
he was forced to find other people willing to take it on so he could step back into the shadows .
out of control so much so that he declined to comment on the sudden fame for this article .
ted kekatos gets involved with his job there are many others that have suffered when their good idea suddenly becomes a web phenomenon .
ted kekatos thought up the idea for a day to celebrate system administrators , those unsung heroes that keep your computer network running .
the idea was only circulated among his friends and co-workers but it soon got loose and spread far and wide .
there are even electronic cards available you can send to a sysadmin you think needs some support .
but it has meant mr kekatos reluctantly sacrificing some of his privacy by being picked out in this way .
again mr kekatos was not entirely happy with the compromises it forced upon him .
sing his praises , not those of ted kekatos " this has become a little scary , " he said .
jonah peretti can sympathise with the plight of both mr jones and mr kekatos .
while a student at the massachusetts institute of technology mr peretti took advantage of nike 's service that lets customers order customised sneakers with a word of their choice stitched on to them .
the word that mr peretti wanted inscribed on his footwear was " sweatshop " as a way of commenting on the factory conditions of many people who make the nike gear .
stitch up nike declined to fulfil mr peretti 's order despite his eloquent defence of his choice in several e-mails he exchanged with the company .
mr peretti forwarded the e-mails to a few friends and the rest has become history .
there is a good chance that the chain of e-mails landed in your inbox in february 2001 when they were current .
a spat over customised trainers became a web phenomenon you may have even seen the e-mails reprinted in national newspapers or on anti-globalisation websites .
the meme is still circulating .
one write-up of the series of events branded mr peretti " the poster boy of guerrilla media " albeit a very reluctant one .
mr peretti has said it was never his intention to be a spokesperson for an ideology or a political guru .
frankly , there must be few of us who would want to be such a thing and certainly not without a lifetime of preparation .
let 's be careful out there .
next time it could be you .

the uk lags behind in using renewable energy by john walton bbc news online as delegates from around the world descend on johannesburg for the most important environmental summit in 10 years , does the uk 's own record on sustainable development come up to scratch ?
the deputy prime minister , john prescott , says that britain 's record is " something to be proud of " although he acknowledges there is " a lot more still to do " .
but what do green campaigners think ?
speaking for friends of the earth matt philips says there has been some progress since 1992 , particularly in the uk itself on clean air , clean water and the protection of the natural environment .
click here to see which nation emits the most greenhouse gases development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs sustainable development , defined by the un but he warns : " perhaps more important is the uk 's effect on the rest of the world .
" the uk is a massive consumer of goods and resources from abroad , especially in areas like agriculture and mining , and through the financial influence of the city .
uk plc is not having a positive influence on the rest of the world .
" one area in particular where the uk has a negative impact is illegal logging . "
he says the uk is " one of the worst countries in europe " in terms of its consumption of illegally logged wood .
negative numbers mean the target has been exceeded greenpeace offer a similar verdict , contrasting positive changes within the uk , with what they say is a poor record abroad .
executive director stephen tindale says : " progress has been made in protecting biodiversity within the uk , but nothing is being done to help biodiversity lost globally . "
he has praise for the climate change levy , a new energy tax on businesses introduced in april this year , as " the best thing " tony blair 's government has done .
tindale adds : " getting the kyoto treaty on reducing worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases was down to prescott and meacher , but this achievement has been undermined by the dirty technology -lsb- coal fired power stations -rsb- we export to the developing world . "
on the whole he says the government does have some commitment to green issues but he says : " not enough effort is being put into it , we are only creeping forward . "
uk consumption degrades other nation 's natural resources poor records on waste recycling and ministers rowing back on commitments to curb car use , are both cases in point .
" a huge effort is being put into making the uk the fourth largest economy on earth , but no such effort has been put into reducing its impact on the rest of the planet .
it 's one step forward , two steps back . "
jonathan porritt , a veteran environmental campaigner and now the head of the government 's sustainable development commission , says the uk is by no means one of the world 's worst offenders .
uk species like the water vole are making a comeback he told bbc news online : " compared with its peers it is doing as well as almost all of them .
perhaps only the scandinavian countries and the netherlands have a more progressive approach .
" it would be dishonest to say that the uk is lagging behind the rest of the world on these issues , but we do have some blind spots . "
these include , he says , a failure to do much more than place " a green gloss " over existing polices , and a tendency to favour " incrementalism " over large scale change .
" over the last 10 years the environment has n't received the level of political attention it warrants , either from labour or conservative governments .
the uk is one of europe 's worst recyclers " it is seen by many policy wonks as being of marginal importance , and they are being caught out as a result .
the were caught out particularly by the uproar over plans to leave michael meacher -lsb- the uk 's environment minister -rsb- in the uk during the johannesburg summit . "
" it was completely ridiculous that the uk delegation would not include the one minister who knows about environmental issues . "
as far as the government is concerned , he says : " the environment is much lower down the pecking order than free trade . "
" my real concern is that this government is not prepared to take on big business .
they have excessive enthusiasm for letting business regulate itself . "
and what does this mean for the future ?
porritt answers bleakly : " i 'm not hugely optimistic at the moment . "

the sights , smells and sounds of the caribbean filled the narrow streets as thousands descended on the area to party over the next two days .
while up to 10,000 police officers prepared for two days of hard work keeping the event safe , visitors were enjoying the break from work to listen to steel bands , ragga , soca , hip hop and uk garage .
a key element of carnival is the taste of trinidad and tobago and so one popular stall along the u-shaped route is blacka warren 's .
' amazing atmosphere ' blacka , from hertfordshire , grows his own herbs and spices and it goes into his mouth watering recipes .
he said : " i 've got spring onions and every herb that will spice up that juicy jerk chicken .
" i grow everything with my friends and family and we tasted it before carnival to make sure it was perfect for everyone .
delicious ! "
but the main theme of sunday 's carnival centres on children and young people so a shorter procession is under way .
youngsters have been putting the finishing touches to their costumes for months and perfecting their dance routines .
carnival goer clark ainsworth said : " it 's an amazing atmosphere .
the streets are lined almost three deep now and everyone is enjoying the floats going by .
" the kids look great in their costumes .
they must have spent so much time on their outfits .
there 's a real family atmosphere here today .
" the one thing i ca n't get over is the smell .
barbeque , jerk chicken - it 's wonderful . "
debi gardner , one of the organisers of the event , said : " we 've put a lot of work in to make family day a really great event .
" the emphasis this year is definitely on culture rather than ' street party ' .
we 've got more steel bands and other types of music . "
