in february icann , the organisation that oversees the running of the net , put forward a plan to change the way it drew up policy and raised money .
but the plan provoked criticism from many commentators who questioned whether it would achieve its aims .
many put forward their own reform proposals .
now icann wants to gather the suggestions to redraft the original proposal , and is asking for anyone interested to send in their ideas .
protest plan the debate about the future of the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- was started in february when stuart lynn , the organisation 's president , published his roadmap for reform .
that plan bluntly described icann as " failing " and said unless action was taken to accelerate its decision making and improve the way it was funded , it was in danger of collapse .
we can not achieve what we are asked to do with the level of resources we have now stuart lynn , icann the proposal unleashed a wave of protests from inside and outside icann , starting a debate about the way forward for the troubled organisation .
karl auerbach , an icann board member and critic of the organisation , called the plan " corporate suicide " .
now the icann group charged with overseeing the reform plan , the committee on icann evolution and reform , is inviting those with alternative proposals to send them to the net body before 29 april so the plan can be redrafted .
once all the submissions have been gathered , the committee will thrash out a new version that will be made public by 31 may , ready to be debated at the next icann general meeting in bucharest .
" the key point is not my proposal but the notion that there are serious problems that have to be solved if icann is to go forward , " stuart lynn told bbc news online .

the original plan could , and probably should , change between now and bucharest , he said .
his only proviso for any novel plan was that there was agreement between the scope of the new role and the resources needed to do it .
" you have to have a match between the overall mission and the resources to do it , " he said .
he said there could be conflict between many of the proposals being forward by groups with particular sectional interests .
" everybody wants a lightweight icann , but each constituency has something to include that 's relevant to them , " he said .
" if you take the sum total you end up with something that is much bigger . "

the west belfast mp said he received a letter of invitation from the house of representatives international relations committee a week after it was published in a newspaper .
however , he has yet to decide whether to testify .
" i have been advised very strongly not to go , " he told bbc radio ulster 's inside politics programme on saturday .
gerry adams : undecided as to whether to attend hearing " i have not made my mind up at this time and i have to say . that it is not the most pressing issue in the middle of an election .
" it is not the most pressing issue on my mind at this time . "
last month , colombian prosecutors formally charged three ira suspects with teaching bomb-making to marxist rebels , bringing the men 's trial a significant step closer .
prosecutors passed the case to a federal judge six months after the three men were arrested while leaving an area controlled by the rebel revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
invitation the three , jim monaghan , martin mccauley and niall connolly , face up to eight years in jail if convicted .
two of the men are from the republic of ireland and one is from northern ireland .
the invitation to mr adams was issued by henry hyde , who is the chairman of the us house of representatives international relations committee .
mr hyde has asked mr adams to attend the hearing on 24 april .
the hearing is entitled : the ira in colombia - the global links of international terrorism .
it is not the most pressing issue on my mind at this time gerry adams sinn fein leader in a reference to the arrest of the three irish men in colombia , mr hyde has asked the sinn fein president to make clear what his party leadership knew about the ira 's activities with " colombia 's narco-terrorists " .
the congressman described the issue as a " serious matter which involved us national interests " .
the three men in custody have denied the allegations , and bought advertising space in a newspaper in february to say they had been " framed as part of attempts to damage peace talks between the government and rebels " .
under colombian law , the three men have the right to appeal against the prosecutor 's charges .
the judge decides if the case should go forward , and if so sets a trial date .
according to the prosecutor 's report , witnesses have testified that they saw the three men in the switzerland-sized zone in southern colombia controlled by the farc .
technical evidence revealed traces of explosives on their clothes , the report said .
