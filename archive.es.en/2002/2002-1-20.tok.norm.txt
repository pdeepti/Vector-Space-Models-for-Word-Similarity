lip sewing is a practice unknown in our culture ... and it 's something that offends the sensitivities of australians immigration minister phillip ruddock three teenage asylum seekers , aged 12 to 15 , had to have stitches removed from their lips , after fears that they were suffering from dehydration .
immigration minister phillip ruddock said the protest would not influence any decision about visa applications .
since the fall of the taleban government , australia has suspended processing of asylum claims from about 2,000 afghans who said they faced persecution by the taleban if they returned to afghanistan .
australia says that , since the change of government in kabul , they are unlikely to qualify for refugee status .
violent protests security guards at the remote woomera detention centre who tried to prevent some of the protesters from mutilating themselves were pelted with stones , and one guard was seriously injured .
the protest , which began on wednesday , is the latest in a series of outbreaks of violence at woomera .
last month , three days of rioting left 21 security guards injured and caused more than $ 1m in damage - and that followed similar unrest in november .
drastic action this time , about 70 people , mainly from afghanistan , have sewn their lips together with needles and material from clothing and blankets .
about 300 others are reported to be refusing to eat or drink .
" lip sewing is a practice unknown in our culture but we 've seen it before amongst detainees and it 's something that offends the sensitivities of australians , " mr ruddock told the australian broadcasting corporation on saturday .
" they believe it will influence decisions .
it ca n't and it wo n't . "
mr ruddock says none of the people involved will go hungry , and where life is at risk , authorities will deal with it .
hardline approach there are 1,000 asylum seekers , including many children , at woomera , which is the most remote of australia 's network of six detention camps .
inmates are locked away while their claims for asylum are investigated .
some are there for up to five years , but most are detained for no more than a few months .
refugee groups have accused the federal government of deliberately slowing down the asylum process .
the catholic welfare organisation , centre care , said it was no surprise that some detainees - who are mainly from iran , iraq and afghanistan - had decided to take such drastic action .
under the australian government 's new hardline policies aimed at deterring illegal immigrants , recent arrivals have been shipped off to the pacific nations of nauru and papua new guinea to have their claims assessed there .
but the government has massive public support for its approach .
the number of people seeking refuge in australia has risen to 5,000 a year from only a few hundred five years ago .

global pc sales -lrb- ' 000 units -rrb- dell , 4,863 compaq , 3,827 hp , 2,722 ibm , 2,110 fujitsu-siemens , 1,674 others : 19,036 data : october to december source : idc reports from consultants gartner dataquest and international data corporation -lrb- idc -rrb- have shown that the decline in computer shipments last year was the heaviest since the mid-1980s , when the industry was in its infancy .
in the us , where consumer sentiment has been battered most severely by the effects of 11 september , sales fell by 10-11 % year on year .
but relatively healthy figures towards the end of the year offered some signs of hope for a recovery , both analysts said .
as if to underline the positive feeling , pc market leader dell has also raised its revenue and earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter .
falling down the two reports differed in some details , but painted the same picture .
sales fell dramatically last year - by 4.6 % over the year as a whole , gartner said .
according to idc , sales in the last three months of 2001 were 6.7 % lower than a year before .
in the us , sales fell 11.1 % by gartner 's reckoning , or 10.1 % by idc 's .
according to brian gammage , principal analyst at gartner , the slump was the result of the economic slowdown coming precisely at a time when consumers ' need continually to upgrade their pcs was on the wane .
improvements in processing power have meant that even basic pcs can perform beyond most users ' requirements , mr gammage said .
until recently , industry optimists were predicting that pc demand would double annually indefinitely .
now , mr gammage said , the market was likely to grow by a single-figure digit , even once the economic effects had been stripped away .
dell 's delight nor has the slump been distributed evenly among manufacturers .
the only major pc maker to boost both sales and market share was us giant dell , which now accounts for 13-14 % of global shipments .
rivals , such as compaq , hewlett-packard and ibm , suffered considerable year-on-year declines in sales .
compaq , for example , sold 3.8 million computers in the last three months of last year , compared with 4.7 million in the same period of 2000 .
dell has now raised its sales estimates for the current quarter - ending on 1 february - to $ 8bn , from the previous $ 7.6bn.
the company is working on shipment growth targets of 40-50 % , way in excess of overall growth for the pc market .
turnaround time both gartner and idc also insisted that there were grounds for optimism .
although sales fell in the fourth quarter on an annual basis , they showed strong quarter-on-quarter growth - 16.9 % , according to idc .
this indicates that the 11 september effect may only have been short-lived , analysts say .
according to the optimistic scenario , purchases of pcs , especially by companies , may only have been postponed , rather than cancelled , in the last six months of 2001 .
the key indicator here is employment , since staff numbers tally extremely closely with corporate demand for workstations , mr gammage said .
since 11 september , unemployment rates throughout the developed world have risen slightly , but not as catastrophically as some had predicted .
prices plunge less favourable for pc makers is the fact that unit sales of computers disguise the heavy discounts at which many are selling .
dell 's success in 2001 was based largely on an aggressive pricing policy , introduced in the middle of last year .
plunging prices have almost eliminated profit margins , and caused a rethink among manufacturers such as ibm - for whom pcs are no longer a core business - and compaq and hp , which are planning to merge .
the compaq-hp merger has run into trouble in the past few months , and prospects for putting together another large computer-industry merger do not look strong .
dell , meanwhile , is only one-third of the way towards its target of a 40 % global market share .

we 're still trying to contact relevant departments on this matter chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman according to britain 's financial times and the washington post , president jiang is said to be furious and a major investigation has been launched inside china .
but the chinese and us governments are so far avoiding the issue in public , with china saying it is too early to comment .
the development comes just weeks before a scheduled sino-us summit in beijing , and china has been restating its commitment to good ties with washington .
" we 're still trying to contact relevant departments on this matter , " a chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman told the french news agency afp .
the modifications were carried out under chinese surveillance " we will notify you when we have a comment . "
as she was speaking , vice president hu jintao was telling a meeting of former us ambassadors and academics in beijing that good ties between the two states were " in the interest of both nations " and the world .
mr hu said there had been " ups and downs " in relations , but he made no reference to the bugging story , which has not been reported in the chinese media .
in washington , white house spokesman taylor gross said : " we never discuss these kinds of allegations . "
arrests according to the ft , the plane was built at the boeing factory in seattle , then fitted out with vip features by other companies in texas .
bugging scandal - the allegations 27 tiny , satellite-controlled bugs found on plane some bugs located in toilet and the headboard of the presidential bed bugs gave off static whine during test flights beijing , which had its own personnel supervising the work in the us , has now reportedly launched an investigation .
twenty chinese air force officers are being questioned on suspicion of negligence and corruption , and two officials from the china aviation supplies export and import corporation are in custody .
according to the washington post , the airliner is sitting with its insides torn out at an air base north of beijing .
one of the texas companies which fitted out the plane has denied any tampering with the plane .

the winner of the auditions for a kylie mingoue lookalike taking place in newport , south wales is already guaranteed tours of the uk and europe as part of a one-year contract .
and the wales-based promoters say there is a possibility of a gig in russia - instead of the real kylie whose recent chart successes mean she is much in demand- for the successful lookalike .
" the successful singer does not have to look like kylie but she will have to have some of kylie 's magic , " said jason o 'ryan of the firm behind the search scm promotions , they are also hoping a welsh singer will come through to win the audition because of the real kylie 's connections with wales .
" of course , kylie 's mum from wales so it would be nice if we could get someone who is welsh as well , " mr o 'ryan said .
" but we 're not counting on it . "
the promoters already have one tribute band on their books - step to it .
the band is made up of all welsh members and has been in demand since it was formed in 2000 on the heels of steps , who announced on boxing day they were splitting up .
" tribute bands have become really big since the whole abba thing , " said mr o 'ryan .
" people who ca n't get tickets to see the real thing seem happy to come and watch them . "
" at the end of the show members of the band go out and meet their audience - for some its better than the real thing . "
the lookalike kylie on trial in newport on sunday will have to perform one of the australian star 's hits and learn a dance routine .
" we 've had applications from six girls from wales and around 12 more are coming over the bridge from england , " said mr o 'ryan .
the winner will have six weeks to get her act together before her first performance on 2 march in ludlow , shropshire before beginning an 80 date tour of the uk in porthcawl on 17 may .
further dates in holland , ireland , germany and scandinavia are promised and the promoters have also been approached about the possbility of the tribute kylie replacing ms minogue in a russian gig .
scm are also planning a search for a tribute performer to daniel o 'connell as well as a boy band imitator later in the year .
