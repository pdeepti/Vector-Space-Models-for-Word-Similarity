the pentagon released the names of the dead , who included six men and the first female member of the us services to have died since the beginning of the military campaign in afghanistan three months ago .
crew members killed captain matthew w bancroft captain daniel g mccollum gunnery sergeant stephen l bryson staff sergeant scott n germosen sergeant nathan p hays lance corporal bryan p bertrand sergeant jeannette l winters officials said the exact cause for the crash was unknown .
it occured during an approach to shamsi airfield , about 280 km -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- south-west of quetta in baluchistan province , which is used by us forces operating in neighbouring afghanistan .
the kc-130 is an aircraft routinely used by us marines for in-flight refuelling of helicopters .
it had been on a multi-stop mission originating in jacobabad , east of shamsi , when it came down in a remote , sparsely-populated area at about 2015 local time -lrb- 1515 gmt -rrb- on wednesday .
the pentagon has said it does not believe hostile action was responsible for the crash .
site secured eyewitnesses are quoted as saying they saw flames coming from the plane before it crashed .
our hearts and prayers go out to the families of the soldiers but i want to remind them that the cause that we are now engaged in is just and noble - the cause is freedom us president george w bush " residents saw flames from the burning plane before it crashed into the lundi mountains , " local reporter saeed malangzai told the associated press news agency .
us marines and pakistani personnel have reached and secured the crash site , but the terrain has hampered the recovery of bodies , said a us central command spokesman .
" we made it to the crash site on foot , " said major randy sandoz .
" but they were unable to remain there .
it is a very steep grade and they were unable to get footing .
the site is secure . "
the us , which launched a military campaign against afghanistan 's taleban rulers in early october , has continued to carry out air strikes in the hope of rooting out remaining members of osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network .
last month , a us marine helicopter burst into flames after crashing near a us held airstrip in southern afghanistan , injuring one marine on board and one on the ground .
president george w bush conveyed his condolences to the dead crew 's families but said those killed had been fighting in a " just and noble " cause .
" the cause is freedom and this nation will not rest until we 've achieved our objective , " he said .

staff at mid cornwall aquatics have been scouring breeder 's records to find out if the rare brazilian seahorses have broken the world record .
hippocampus reidi , as they are formally known , more usually produce just one or two offspring in captivity .
les wiley , who runs the aquatic shop in st. austell garden centre , told bbc news online : " we have looked on all the breeder 's registers and no-one has ever reared that number before , as they are not common seahorses .
the parents were imported from america " as far as we are aware it is a world first - we have heard about one or two surviving in america , but we have never heard about more than 100 before .
" people come in just to look at them and say ' aaaah ' - it is the ' fluffy-bunny ' syndrome . "
the infant seahorses , collectively known as fry , are five months old and have grown to four inches tall .
their seven-inch parents are yellow but can change colour to suit their environment .
special diet mr wiley , 54 , said : " to get them to breed and raise the fry you need to start by conditioning the parents , which are fed mycid shrimp , brine shrimp , and small krill .
" seahorses are dependent on long chain fatty acids .
" but a few of the easier feeding types are not dependent on food for the acids and have the ability to build them , so they have been bred in larger numbers before . "
" children come in and say ' look at the seahorse mum , ' when they have never spoken about fish before , " he added .
the seahorses are found in the wild around the coast of south america and in the caribbean .
