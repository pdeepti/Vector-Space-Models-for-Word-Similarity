official sources confirmed that the helicopter had not been shot at , though the cause of the accident remained unclear .
according to a spokesperson for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , an engine fault is likely to have caused the crash .
the german defense ministry described the plane as a mid-sized military transport helicopter of the type sikorsky ch-53 .
afghan defense ministry spokesman gulbuddin said the helicopter crashed a few miles east of kabul airport near a road leading to the bagram air base , the headquarters for the u.s. military in afghanistan .
initially reports said that two afghan children on the ground were killed as the helicopter crashed , however , the german defense ministry has stated that the girls , who had been playing near the site of the accident , have since been located and are unharmed .
no other civilians have been reported missing .
eyewitnesses spoke of the helicopter catching fire and sending clouds of smoke into the air .
one witness told reuters , " the plane was heading towards kabul when it nosed down towards the ground and caused a big explosion . "
the helicopter crash marks the second accident in afghanistan involving germans soldiers .
on march 6 this year , two german and three danish soldiers were killed while attempting to dismantle a older soviet anti-aircraft missile .

the oppositional christian democrat-christian socialist -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary group insisted on establishing the “ electoral fraud committee ” to substantiate its accusations that the current social democrat-green party governmental coalition told lies in order to win re-election in september this year . the body will look into whether and to what extent members of the government gave the parliament and the german public false or incomplete information before the 2002 vote . " island of the oblivious " the cdu / csu has singled out chancellor gerhard schröder , finance minister hans eichel and health minister ulla schmidt for criticism , claiming that the three social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- lied about the state of the country ’ s finances and social welfare system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel gestures in front of a red colored painting before a social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- leadership meeting in berlin on monday , oct .
14 , 2002 .
eichel has to save 14 billion euro for the next governing term that will be an issue during the talks with the greens party coalition partner monday .
-lrb- ap photo / jan bauer -rrb- in a radio interview on friday , peter altmaier , spokesman for the cdu in the commission , accused eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- of making statements about budget gaps after the election that were the opposite of what the minister had said before the election .
“ the finance minister claims that he was , so to say , taking a holiday on the island of the oblivious , ” altmaier said . shortly after the election eichel revealed that in 2002 germany would exceed the deficit ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product set by the eu for countries in the euro-zone .
economics experts had already predicted that germany would violate the regulations before the september election . coalition fights back the spd and green party were unable to prevent the electoral fraud committee ’ s establishment , since the constitution ensures that founding such a body only requires approval from one-quarter of parliament . they did , however , push through an additional task for the committee .
the body will also consider whether chancellor schröder ’ s government behaved differently from previous german governments going back to 1990 in the way it dealt with predictions and tax estimates .
the issue is whether former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s government coalition - made up of cdu / csu and the free democrats - withheld information about the costs of reunification to be re-elected . the cdu / csu parliamentary group has announced that the election fraud committee ’ s broadened mandate violates the law on fact-finding committees by subverting the original aim of the inquiry and drawing out the process .
the party is now considering whether to appeal to the german constitutional court . no results expected the committee ’ s 11 members got to work on friday .
in the end they are likely to come to different conclusions , since the five social democrats , four christian democrats and christian socialists , the one free democrat and the one green party member are all looking for something different . in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag , german president johannes rau called on the government and the opposition to engage in constructive and honest politics and not to use the election fraud committee to damage each other . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition to target german government the conservative opposition parties have decided to go ahead with a committee investigating what they are calling electoral fraud regarding the state of germany 's economy .

afghan defense ministry spokesman gulbuddin said the helicopter crashed a few miles east of kabul airport near a road leading to the bagram air base , the headquarters for the u.s. military in afghanistan .

" island of the oblivious " the cdu / csu has singled out chancellor gerhard schröder , finance minister hans eichel and health minister ulla schmidt for criticism , claiming that the three social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- lied about the state of the country ’ s finances and social welfare system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel gestures in front of a red colored painting before a social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- leadership meeting in berlin on monday , oct .
14 , 2002 .
eichel has to save 14 billion euro for the next governing term that will be an issue during the talks with the greens party coalition partner monday .
-lrb- ap photo / jan bauer -rrb- in a radio interview on friday , peter altmaier , spokesman for the cdu in the commission , accused eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- of making statements about budget gaps after the election that were the opposite of what the minister had said before the election .
“ the finance minister claims that he was , so to say , taking a holiday on the island of the oblivious , ” altmaier said . shortly after the election eichel revealed that in 2002 germany would exceed the deficit ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product set by the eu for countries in the euro-zone .
economics experts had already predicted that germany would violate the regulations before the september election . coalition fights back the spd and green party were unable to prevent the electoral fraud committee ’ s establishment , since the constitution ensures that founding such a body only requires approval from one-quarter of parliament . they did , however , push through an additional task for the committee .
the body will also consider whether chancellor schröder ’ s government behaved differently from previous german governments going back to 1990 in the way it dealt with predictions and tax estimates .
the issue is whether former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s government coalition - made up of cdu / csu and the free democrats - withheld information about the costs of reunification to be re-elected . the cdu / csu parliamentary group has announced that the election fraud committee ’ s broadened mandate violates the law on fact-finding committees by subverting the original aim of the inquiry and drawing out the process .
the party is now considering whether to appeal to the german constitutional court . no results expected the committee ’ s 11 members got to work on friday .
in the end they are likely to come to different conclusions , since the five social democrats , four christian democrats and christian socialists , the one free democrat and the one green party member are all looking for something different . in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag , german president johannes rau called on the government and the opposition to engage in constructive and honest politics and not to use the election fraud committee to damage each other . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition to target german government the conservative opposition parties have decided to go ahead with a committee investigating what they are calling electoral fraud regarding the state of germany 's economy .

official sources confirmed that the helicopter had not been shot at , though the cause of the accident remained unclear .
according to a spokesperson for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , an engine fault is likely to have caused the crash .
the german defense ministry described the plane as a mid-sized military transport helicopter of the type sikorsky ch-53 .
afghan defense ministry spokesman gulbuddin said the helicopter crashed a few miles east of kabul airport near a road leading to the bagram air base , the headquarters for the u.s. military in afghanistan .
initially reports said that two afghan children on the ground were killed as the helicopter crashed , however , the german defense ministry has stated that the girls , who had been playing near the site of the accident , have since been located and are unharmed .
no other civilians have been reported missing .
eyewitnesses spoke of the helicopter catching fire and sending clouds of smoke into the air .
one witness told reuters , " the plane was heading towards kabul when it nosed down towards the ground and caused a big explosion . "
the helicopter crash marks the second accident in afghanistan involving germans soldiers .
on march 6 this year , two german and three danish soldiers were killed while attempting to dismantle a older soviet anti-aircraft missile .

the chancellor stressed though that the operation to protect kabul and the surrounding area is necessary : “ it ’ s about defending our value system , ” he said . schröder also ruled out an extension of germany ’ s mandate to other parts of the country .

the german defense ministry described the plane as a mid-sized military transport helicopter of the type sikorsky ch-53 .
afghan defense ministry spokesman gulbuddin said the helicopter crashed a few miles east of kabul airport near a road leading to the bagram air base , the headquarters for the u.s. military in afghanistan .
initially reports said that two afghan children on the ground were killed as the helicopter crashed , however , the german defense ministry has stated that the girls , who had been playing near the site of the accident , have since been located and are unharmed .
no other civilians have been reported missing .
eyewitnesses spoke of the helicopter catching fire and sending clouds of smoke into the air .
one witness told reuters , " the plane was heading towards kabul when it nosed down towards the ground and caused a big explosion . "
the helicopter crash marks the second accident in afghanistan involving germans soldiers .
on march 6 this year , two german and three danish soldiers were killed while attempting to dismantle a older soviet anti-aircraft missile .

sam bith , 69 , was the most senior of three khmer rouge commanders charged with abducting the tourists after an attack on a train in southern cambodia in 1994 .
the backpackers , a briton , a frenchman and an australian , were later executed and buried in the jungle , several weeks after ransom negotiations failed .
at least 10 cambodians were also killed in the attack on the train .
" this is an injustice and i will appeal to the court of appeal , " said sam bith after he was found guilty on six different charges , including conspiring to commit murder , abduction and terrorism .
he also argued that it was pointless to jail him for life , because he does not expect to live for more than five years .
sam bith is in poor health , suffering from a heart complaint , diabetes and a tumour on his back .
earlier trials sam bith , who was arrested in may after eight years on the run , had been charged with kidnapping , conspiring in premeditated murder , terrorism and robbery .
australian david wilson , briton mark slater and frenchman jean-michel braquet , all aged in their late 20s , were abducted on 26 july , 1994 .
sam bith had been the commander of the area in southwestern cambodia where the train was ambushed .
however , he had argued in court that he had been transferred away from the area a month before the attack took place .
khmer rouge general nuon paet was jailed for life in june 1999 for his role in the case .
the supreme court later turned down an appeal against his conviction .
another officer , colonel chhouk rin , was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment in september , but has vowed to appeal against the sentence .
during his trial , nuon paet said sam bith , who was his superior officer , had ordered the tourists killed .
the communist khmer rouge ruled cambodia for four bloody years from 1975-1979 , during which an estimated 1.7 million cambodians were executed or died from starvation and overwork .
after the khmer rouge was driven from power , it kept up a guerrilla war from the jungle , until its leaders gave up and sought amnesties in the late 1990s .

health secretary alan milburn announced on monday plans for 23 new diagnostic and treatment centres .
of these 12 will be run by the nhs , at a cost of almost £ 100m , and the rest will be run by the private sector .
private-run centres north bristol south bristol dorset and somerset south west peninsula burton on trent chesterfield greater manchester north bradford basildon and thurrock stanmore daventry ten such centres , which will handle operations like hip replacements , have already been piloted over the last 12 months .
mr milburn said bids to run clinics would be considered from both uk and overseas independent healthcare providers .
successful bidders will either work alone or in a joint venture with the nhs .
extra operations the units are designed to take some pressure off nhs hospitals and free up beds for more seriously ill patients .

operations like hip or knee replacement or the removal of cataracts are among the most commonly performed surgery in nhs theatres .
patients referred to one of the centres will be able to choose the date and time of their initial appointment - usually within six weeks of referral - and arrange any necessary treatment at a time which suits them .
they will stay just long enough to recover from their surgery - often a matter of hours .
mr milburn said : " by developing these new services within the nhs and by drawing services from independent healthcare providers into the nhs we can help to ensure that people no longer have to opt out of the nhs to get the faster treatment they need . "
however , mr milburn has attracted criticism for plans to shake-up healthcare in the uk - particularly with the use of private funding .
former health secretary frank dobson told the independent on sunday he welcomed the new nhs centres , but frowned upon the involvement of private companies .
foundation hospitals he said : " generally it 's a good thing because these places will crack on with dealing with cold surgery .
" they do n't have to deal with accident and emergency , and they can keep going even if there is a flu epidemic .
" but i see no point in involving the private sector because it does n't add to the number of doctors or nurses . "
karen jennings , head of health at unison said there was no doubt that patients would benefit from the extra services .
but she warned use of the private sector came with a heath warning attached .
" private companies are now encroaching on every aspect of the nhs , draining resources and staff away from our national health service . "
shadow health secretary dr liam fox said : " the conservatives have always said that what matters is when patients are treated , and the quality of that treatment , not where it happens .
" we therefore welcome the involvement of the private sector in implementing nhs delivery .
" the fact that alan milburn has chosen to make this announcement when parliament is not sitting shows not only his contempt for the commons but also how he is running scared from his backbenchers . "
doctors ' response the british medical association welcomed moved to increase capacity and cut waiting times for patients .
a spokeswoman said : " surgeons and anaesthetists find it extraordinarily frustrating when operations are cancelled because there are no beds available for their patients .

figures from the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- suggest that bosses who failed to pay workers the minimum wage have been forced to hand over £ 3m -lrb- $ 4.8m -rrb- in arrears for the past eight months .
the dti said a total of £ 12m had now been collected from unscrupulous bosses who had not paid the minimum wage since it was introduced in april 1999 .
the minimum wage was set at £ 4.20 per hour for 22 year olds and over and £ 3.60 for workers aged between 18 and 21 , but thousands of employers had either deliberately or unwittingly failed to meet these levels .
christmas bonus scrooge bosses will not get away with poverty pay alan johnson , employment minister the dti said its timely findings had identified more than 5,000 workers who would receive an average of £ 550 each in payment arrears .
one example was a 73 year old cleaner , who recently received £ 1,118 because his employer had not realised the minimum wage applied to workers aged over 65 .
employment minister alan johnson said : " i am delighted that a £ 3m pay boost for over five thousand workers has been identified in time for christmas . "
the government is now urging workers to make contact if they believe they are being underpaid .
" we are committed to delivering decent standards at work and scrooge bosses will not get away with poverty pay , " said mr johnson .
asking for more however , a number of workers are still protesting that the minimum wage is not enough .
low paid public sector employees in london last month claimed they were being forced to take on two or three jobs in order to meet the cost of living in london .
they are calling for a minimum wage of £ 6.50 per hour .
in the past few months , university staff , teachers and council workers have voted to strike over london allowances .

its bid to expand and link with the national network has been bolstered by an article in the latest issue of a national railway magazine .
' magnificent ' facility heritage railway has supported it being developed into an operating arm of the york-based museum .
the latest issue of the magazine describes the great central as a " magnificent education and leisure facility " with the potential to grow into a major magnet for tourists .
it would not only boost the railway as it struggles with its own money troubles , but would also be a boon for the loughborough economy .
the railway is currently drawing up new plans for its future .
great central railway operates full-sized steam trains every weekend and on weekdays from june to september .
it also offers people the chance to take the controls of a steam locomotive for between £ 245 and £ 1350 .

hometrack 's figures have suggested a fall in the rate of house price growth for the past seven months , after peaking with a rise of 2 % in may .
at the top end of the market , price falls have already started john wriglesworth , hometrack a raft of other surveys in recent weeks have also suggested that the surging prices of previous months could now be leaving room for more moderate increases next year .

" at the top end of the market , price falls have already started , due mainly to fear of unemployment spurred by the recent spate of city-based job losses , " said john wriglesworth , hometrack 's housing economist .
however , there have been significant rises in other areas .
prices rose by 0.6 % in devon , 0.5 % in county durham and 0.4 % in north and east yorkshire .
hometrack suggested the regional variations would continue into next year , estimating a 4 % rise in uk house prices for the year but a 5 % fall in london prices .
there is no question that the housing market has been slowing down over the course of the last six months , and this trend is likely to continue into next year john wriglesworth " there will be a significant north-south divide next year , with the north buoyant and active and the south east slowing and stagnating , " said mr wriglesworth .
falling trend hometrack 's findings confirm recent suggestions from mortgage lenders , house builders and surveyors that the runaway prices are coming to an end .
last week , the royal institution of chartered surveyors -lrb- rics -rrb- suggested house price inflation had slowed in november for the third month in a row , while house builder persimmon said prices for new homes had been slowing for the past few months .
however , the nationwide suggested house prices would continue to rise by about 10 % next year , although there were likely to be regional variations .
hometrack said house buyers were continuing to pay less than the asking price , with the average price paid in december falling for the sixth month in a row .
home owners received an average of 95.9 % of the asking price in december , compared with 97.7 % in june .
" there is no question that the housing market has been slowing down over the course of the last six months , and this trend is likely to continue into next year , " said mr wriglesworth .

review by evan davis bbc economics editor jk galbraith once said there are two types of economists : those who do n't know ; and those who do n't know they do n't know .
at the moment , most seem to be in the latter camp .
most british forecasters -lrb- and gordon brown -rrb- expect 2003 to deliver reasonable growth , a gentle rebalancing of the economy -lrb- in other words , a slowdown in consumer spending growth , and a pick-up in manufacturing output -rrb- and a turnaround in business investment .
similarly , for the us , it is supposed that growth , investment and industrial production will pick up , while consumption growth slows down .
this may be a plausible scenario , but in a sense it is a remarkable one , for if it is right , somehow all the sins of dot com madness and the stock market bubble will have been more or less purged .
normally , we expect bubbles to be followed by difficult hangovers , protracted recessions .
this time , it seems we might have enjoyed a roister with barely a twinge .
dangerous sport more remarkable than the apparent optimism of the consensus is the apparent unanimity of it .
of the 26 main forecasts of the us economy for example , no fewer than 19 put growth in the relatively narrow range of 2.4-2.9 % .
surely , there should be more variation ?
as it happens , for my money , forecasting at the moment seems to me a dangerous sport .
it is easier to posit several , distinct scenarios that might occur , than it is to make a sensible judgement about which particular one will pertain .
looking up ...
let 's have a look at some of those scenarios .
certainly , the rosy consensus forecast is one .
it might be that this cycle can be more benign than previous ones .
in particular , it might be that because the nineties boom was associated with a remarkable accumulation of global manufacturing capacity , -lrb- or more accurately , overcapacity -rrb- , we are now able to enjoy a consumer boom in which we use up the capacity created .
the boom ca n't last forever of course , but it can last a while , as companies try to offload the products they are now too good at making .
on this story , the excess capacity keeps prices , inflation and interest rates low .
if the story is right , the process is not as painless as the overall growth figures may suggest , because the savers who paid for the investment boom -lrb- many of them in japan , as it happens -rrb- will have been disappointed by the returns they are making .
but as long as the pain of those savers , and the joy of consumers who benefit from low prices and easy availability of cheap goods are slowly and gently unwound , then it may be the economy will enjoy the relatively rosy scenario being projected . ... and looking down even if things get a little wobbly , in britain at least , we still have monetary policy to stabilise them , and ensure that no panic occurs , and that the economy does n't crash when consumers try to pull in their spending .
after all , if consumers do try to repair their balance sheets , and stop spending too quickly , then interest rates can fall -lrb- after all , there 's little inflation to worry about -rrb- and that will ease the transition for consumers .
so much for the optimistic forecast .
it may fall into place .
alas , one can also paint scenarios for britain and the us in which it does not happen .
here are two main such scenarios : common to each is the fact that consumer spending falls sharply , and in each , for some reason , interest rates ca n't be used to help consumers sort out their finances .
spending crunch the first scenario -lrb- call it the japan syndrome -rrb- is that consumers have a violent moodswing , which lower interest rates simply ca n't counter .
spending crashes , economies feel the lack of demand , and no amount of interest rate cut can alleviate the public 's gloom .
after all , lower interest rates may help borrowers , but they do so at the expense of savers -lrb- for every borrower who is helped by them , there 's a poor lender who is worse off from lower rates -rrb- .
so , if it is savers who are trying to increase their wealth , lower rates may induce people to save more .
back to the future the second scenario -lrb- call it " back to the 1980s " -rrb- is that the exchange rate tumbles .
after all , the pound and dollar have been too high , for too long .
a falling currency pushes up prices , makes the fed or bank of england worried about high inflation , and so rates rise , or at least ca n't fall .
then , as consumers try to retrench , there is no lower interest rate policy that can help them .
this is a less extreme version of the 1980s boom-bust cycle , when higher rates were used to reduce inflation , at the expense of overstetched consumers .
who knows ?
overall , we have three scenarios - the good , the bad and the ugly .
on the one hand , i am struck by the fact that we never have a consumer boom like this one without it ending in tears .
it seems too easy to get off as lightly as the pundits are saying .
on the other hand , i am also struck that we do not often have consumer booms like this without significant inflation problems , which are apparently absent at the moment .
so it may be different this time .
i put myself in the camp that simply does n't know what will happen - and at least i can say i know that i do n't know .
bitter medicine but one point which seems to me to be more certain : we would have been better off if 2002 had seen slower consumer spending and slower overall growth .
then it would have been easier to resolve the imbalances that have accumulated more gently .
it is ironic that the problems that now may lie in store are less to do with the 1990s excesses , and more to do with the 2002 consumer boom .
we took the medication of low interest rates to allevate the pain of a 1990s hangover , and now face the possibility that the medication itself has led to a dangerous dependency which is worse than the original problem it was designed to cure .

the hospital says it is working hard to contain the norwalk virus which has affected the hospital for nearly two weeks .
patients are being asked to keep their appointments , but visitors have been told to stay away from the hospital unless absolutely necessary .
the norwalk bug is highly contagious and causes vomiting and stomach upsets but is not life-threatening .
it is spread by poor hygiene .
mike burton , on-call manager at the hospital , said : " we have to be on our guard .
" the virus is still in the community , but we are doing all we can to contain it . "
relatives warning more than 30 patients and 50 staff have been hit by the norwalk virus and a growing number of operations are being postponed .
mr burton said people should still come for emergency treatment , or if an appointment has been made .
he said : " the staff are doing a very good job at keeping the lid on it , but it only needs one person with the virus to come into the hospital and the cycle of disease starts all over again . "
there have been a number of outbreaks of the virus in the south west this year .
during the worst outbreak , 13 wards at derriford hospital in plymouth were closed .
torbay hospital last week reopened one ward that had been affected by the virus , but it has had to stop admissions to three other wards .
