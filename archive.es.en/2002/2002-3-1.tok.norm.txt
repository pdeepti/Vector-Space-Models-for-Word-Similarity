the commonwealth ministerial action group released no details of the report it will submit to the full heads of government summit , which begins in the resort of coolum near brisbane on saturday . "
the situation is not good ...
the situation is deteriorating " commonwealth secretary general don mckinnon president robert mugabe 's government is accused of breaches of democratic rule and intimidation during the campaign for presidential elections which take place on 9-10 march .
britain is pressing for zimbabwe 's immediate expulsion from the commonwealth , but the move is opposed by a majority of the eight-member action group .
" we do n't believe that there is a place in the commonwealth for a government which is prepared to inflict such suffering on its people and which continues to flout the commonwealth 's fundamental values , " a spokesman for prime minister tony blair said .
he conceded , however , that it was " unrealistic " to expect a decision on suspending zimbabwe to be taken at the summit .
commonwealth secretary general don mckinnon said the situation in zimbabwe is " deteriorating " .
" certainly there is evidence from a number of international organisations that it is much more uncomfortable there than it was during the june 2000 elections . "
bbc diplomatic correspondent barnaby mason says the most likely outcome will be a recommendation that ministers be given power to act quickly against zimbabwe if necessary after the election .
the ballot presents mr mugabe with the sternest test of his political life .
tight security more than 1,200 delegates have arrived in coolum for the summit , which is being held amid unprecedented security .
on the ground , more than 4,000 police and troops are guarding the conference centre and manning checkpoints at the airport and all major roads around the tiny resort .
high above the conference , f-18 fighter jets , carrying air-to-air missiles , are on constant patrol .
the bbc 's red harrison in coolum says they are the first fully-armed combat missions to be flown in australia since world war ii .
the jets are supported by early warning surveillance aircraft , and have orders to shoot down and destroy any aircraft approaching the area without permission .
australian defence minister robert hill denies delegates face any specific threat .
but he says this is the biggest meeting of world leaders in australia for years and a security blanket of this magnitude has become the norm for such events since the 11 september attacks .

most calls are handled on a first-come , first-served basis regardless of need .
but experts from ninewells hospital in dundee believe a two-tier priority-based system would save thousands of lives every year .
they said such a change would reduce the amount of time needed to get ambulances to people who need them urgently .
the research , published in the journal of the royal society of medicine , also suggests a different system would cut the number of road accidents involving ambulances .
in 2000-2001 there were 328 accidents involving ambulances in scotland alone , the researchers discovered .
the research is based on a study of more than 500 patients taken to ninewells ' casualty unit following a 999 call .
the team aimed to look at the implications of applying triage criteria , assessing which cases are most urgent , to incoming emergency calls before ambulances are sent out .
they collected data to find out how many patients had genuinely needed the fastest possible response by assessing if they had any emergency conditions , like heart attack .
' blue lights and sirens ' this was then compared with the information given by the person who made the 999 call , to see if triage criteria could have been applied .
dr william morrison , who led the research , said : " many inappropriate calls are made by the public in good faith , and it would be unreasonable to expect the average 999 caller to decide how urgent a medical emergency is .
" even under our suggested system , where the ambulance dispatcher makes simple prioritisation decisions , we emphasise that triage criteria must be safe enough to ensure patients who genuinely need a rapid response are not missed . "
dr morrison said ambulance dispatchers could have cut the number sent out by at least 23 % , simply by identifying patients who did not actually need hospital admission .
the researchers concluded that 55 % of all calls for emergency ambulances did not merit an immediate response .
research also showed that the number of ambulance callouts rose during the months the study was carried out , with no increase in resources to match .
dr morrison said : " the response to true emergency calls can be delayed if an ambulance is dealing with some minor incidents .
" an immediate response puts ambulance personnel and other road users at risk and may make no difference to the outcome of the patient . "
the study , called ' blue lights and sirens ? ' suggests that if response times to urgent cases could be cut from 14 to eight minutes , another 300,000 emergencies could be reached each year .
earlier this year the scottish ambulance service proposed a change to the system to prioritise the most urgent emergency calls .
the suggestion could be fully implemented within two years if it receives the go-ahead from the scottish executive .

nato 's dramatic armoured swoop on a southern bosnian village has pushed up a gear the hunt for the hague 's most wanted war crimes suspects , radovan karadzic and ratko mladic .
despite what nato described as very good new intelligence , the s-for troops returned with nothing but a selection of seized weapons , saying there was no sign of the mr karadzic , the fugitive former bosnian serb president .
the decision to close in on the village of celebici , close to the southern town of foca in the autonomous bosnian serb republic , republika srpska , was , however , a sign that nato wants an end to doubts that it has the political will to risk lives to seize the war crimes suspects .
but it sheds little light on where mr karadzic and general mladic actually are .
speculation has long focused on the inhospitable region of steep mountains and extreme summer and winter temperatures around foca as mr karadzic 's key base .
he is reported to have moved around the region frequently in recent years , sheltering in homes , farms and serbian orthodox monasteries , guarded by what is assumed to be a sizeable contingent of loyal bodyguards .
" i do n't believe he is in foca all the time , " british journalist maggie o 'kane told the bbc after travelling to the region in search of mr karadzic last year .
she said there had been reported sightings of him in the areas of rudo , visegrad , cajnice and foca - which between them cover much of the south-east of the country .
family visits within hours of the nato raid , mr karadzic 's brother , luka , had told a belgrade radio station that he had " indirect information " that mr karadzic was fine , although he said he did not know his brother 's whereabouts .
mr karadzic is also reported to have visited his mother , jovanka , across the border in montenegro .
she has told ms o 'kane in an interview that her son is " with his own people " .
and his wife issued a statement last year to quash rumours that her husband was preparing to give himself up and testify against former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic in exchange for a more lenient sentence .
both mr karadzic and his former military commander , general mladic , lived relatively normal lives in the immediate years after the war .
mr karadzic lived in the bosnian serb wartime stronghold of pale , east of sarajevo .
general mladic stayed for years in a suburb of belgrade where he was frequently seen in public , even attending football matches .
elusive general but general mladic became more vulnerable once mr milosevic fell from power .
most speculation then put him in the military bunkers of his wartime command centre at han pijesak , near sarajevo .
the un 's chief war crimes prosecutor , carla del ponte , said in september 2001 , however , that she thought he was in serbia .
this theory gained credence in february 2002 when a high-ranking serbian government minister speaking anonymously said general mladic was in serbia .
the minister said that the authorities had tried to persuade him to surrender and had warned him he was no longer under the protection of the yugoslav army .
correspondents say that after the nato operation , the pressure will be on the serb authorities to arrest the general and hand him over .
