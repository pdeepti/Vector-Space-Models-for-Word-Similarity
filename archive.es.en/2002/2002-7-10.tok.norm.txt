german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .
if the new countries become part of the current policy , germany will get stuck being one of the largest eu net payers for years and years to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less .

your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .
if the new countries become part of the current policy , germany will get stuck being one of the largest eu net payers for years and years to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less .

german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.07.2002 eu agriculture reforms could pinch east german farmers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troubling times ahead for eastern german farmers ?
the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .

how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .

in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .

well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .

basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .

german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .

the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .

german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.07.2002 eu to propose sweeping farming reforms the eu is set to release a plan for the massive restructuring of its direct payment subsidies to farmers .
german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .
if the new countries become part of the current policy , germany will get stuck being one of the largest eu net payers for years and years to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.07.2002 eu to propose sweeping farming reforms the eu is set to release a plan for the massive restructuring of its direct payment subsidies to farmers .
german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .
if the new countries become part of the current policy , germany will get stuck being one of the largest eu net payers for years and years to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less .

german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .
if the new countries become part of the current policy , germany will get stuck being one of the largest eu net payers for years and years to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less .

german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .
if the new countries become part of the current policy , germany will get stuck being one of the largest eu net payers for years and years to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less .

german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .
if the new countries become part of the current policy , germany will get stuck being one of the largest eu net payers for years and years to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .

german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .

german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.07.2002 eu agriculture reforms could pinch east german farmers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troubling times ahead for eastern german farmers ?
the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .
if the new countries become part of the current policy , germany will get stuck being one of the largest eu net payers for years and years to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less .

german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them . will the european union 's new proposal for agricultural policy reform create a new berlin wall between farmers in germany 's western and eastern states ?
that 's the 300,000 euro question on the minds of german politicians as the eu 's agricultural commissioner , austrian-born franz fischler , prepares to unveil his " mid-term review " of the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- on wednesday .
comprising 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 39.7 billion -rrb- , or close to half of the european union 's overall annual budget , the common agricultural policy has always been a rocky issue among eu member nations – especially so-called net payer countries like germany , which puts twice as much into the eu 's purse as it gets back .
in his 32-page mid-term report , fischler will propose eliminating subsidies to farmers based on what they produce .
in the past , for example , the eu has provided the equivalent of income insurance for the producers of agricultural products from wheat to beef .
now , farmers would get a " single income payment per farm " each year that would be tethered to other conditions – like tough standards on the environment and animal welfare – rather than products alone .
additionally , the direct payments would also be reduced by a fifth over a seven-year period .
the savings would then be siphoned off into rural development funds .
putting a lid on direct payments if approved , it would also put a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- cap on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
for farms with more than two employees , a subsidy of 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 2,977 -rrb- per worker is planned .
the smallest farms , with up to two workers , would get 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 4,960 -rrb- per person .
fischler has argued that the new policy will encourage farmers to grow or raise agricultural products for which a real market exists rather than depending solely on government subsidies .
several agricultural sectors would initially be excluded from the plan , including dairy producers , wine growers and olive growers .
a tough blow for eastern german farmers ?
the proposal would have a disproportionate impact on the eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures put in place under the former communist regime in east germany , farms are on average seven times as big as those in the western states .
more than 1,300 farms would be affected by the change .
officials in the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture , estimate the ceiling on subsidies could cost eastern german farmers an annual 250 million euro -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- .
it has also led to in-fighting within the ministry .
while the ministry 's head , renate künast of the green party , has said the proposal is a step " in the right direction , " her social democratic undersecretary , gerald thalheim , has argued that the eu reform will lead to a costly loss of jobs in eastern germany and would destroy existing structures .
a boost for organic farmers but künast has said she is pleased with the plan 's emphasis on aiding smaller and organic farmers and that the proposal will not lead to any loss for eastern german farmers – the subsidies will simply be redirected to the kinds of agricultural projects she has championed since taking office at the height of the mad cow disease crisis .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has also signaled his support for the proposals – with possible conditions .
he says he will look very closely at how the subsidy cuts would impact eastern german agriculture , saying wholesale cuts could create " significant problems " for eastern german farmers .
nonetheless , negotiations over the agricultural reforms have put schröder in a difficult position .
the chancellor has recently put his weight behind pressuring the eu to reduce its agricultural subsidies in preparation for the entry of 10 new member states starting , possibly , in 2004 .
schröder has said that germany would be both unwilling and unable to provide subsidies at the current level to the new eastern european members .
to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

to do so , he asserts , could add 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- a year to germany 's annual eu contribution .
germany and france spar it 's a rift that has split eastern and western as well as northern and southern europe .
it has also planted a wedge between germany and france – once two of europe 's closest allies .
france – whose farmers rely heavily on the common agricultural policy - supports full subsidies and says it does not want to take up the issue of reforming cap until the next eu budget is planned in 2006 .
the eu has proposed providing the new member states with 25 percent of the current eu subsidy rate through 2013 .
in an interview with the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag over the weekend , fischler took aim at schröder and other politicians who allow purse strings to drive their reform motives .
" we ca n't just limit questions about agricultural reform to how it will be financed , " fischler said .
instead , he said , it is important to address the environmental challenges of agriculture , animal welfare and making products safer for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .
the german government has said there is still a " need for clarification " on the reforms .
what position does this put chancellor schröder in , since his government has been a large promoter of reforming the common agricultural policy ?
well , schröder has been very contradictory on the issue anyway .
two years ago , he went to the industrial farmers in germany at the height of the bse -lrb- mad-cow disease -rrb- crisis and said his government was against agri-business , which is mainly what the east is , and would instead support family businesses .
his party does n't usually get many votes from farmers , but jobs do tend to be an spd issue , and this could create problems .
it 's also difficult for schröder because his government fears that it will miss the chance to put a ceiling on agricultural spending before the new member nations enter the eu .
if the new countries become part of the current policy , germany will get stuck being one of the largest eu net payers for years and years to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less .

they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .
at this stage , there are five different measures that can be supported under the rural development provisions of common agricultural policy – afforestation , early retirement schemes for farmers , measures to compensate for environmentally friendly production measures , compensation for conservation areas and support for agriculturally disadvantaged - e.g. low-fertility - areas .
under the reformed policy , the commission wants to introduce additional program areas to the rural development provisions , including food safety , animal welfare and environmental measures .

the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers . german politicians and farmers responded swiftly to the european commission 's approval on wednesday of sweeping reforms to the european union 's 40-year-old common agricultural policy .
under the new system , direct payment subsidies to farmers would be drastically reduced , with larger farms getting no more than € 300,000 -lrb- $ 297,000 -rrb- per year .
additionally , eu subsidies to farmers would be tied to strict standards on food safety , animal welfare and environmentally-sound production methods .
the proposals fit neatly with the german government 's recent calls for cuts to direct farmer subsidies - which have been a major pet peeve of the united states and the world trade organization for years - and the promotion of smaller family owned and organic farms .
but brussels ' tack , which still requires the ratification of all 15 eu member states , could throw a wrench in chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reelection campaign .
if implemented , the german farmers association estimates , the cuts would disproportionately impact eastern german farmers , who could face subsidy cuts as high as € 250 million -lrb- $ 247 million -rrb- per year .
this could lead to job losses and a destabilization of agriculture in the six german states formerly belonging to east germany .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers association in brussels explained the alarm the reform plan has set off in the german agricultural community .
your organization , the german farmers ' association , has called cutting direct payments to farmers " an affront to the eastern german states . "
why ?
the critical issue here is the capping of direct payments to farmers .
the commission plans to reduce direct payments to farmers by 3 percent every year until they 've reached a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 .
this primarily affects the states belonging to the former east germany .
under the old communist agricultural system , the east germans built enormous and highly specialized farms based on soviet models , which had the advantage of economies of scale .
after the wall came down , the land was sold to the same local farmers and leaders who ran the system until 1990 .
some were too huge and were scaled back , but the farms are still larger than those in the western states .
the average western german farm is 30 hectares -lrb- 74 acres -rrb- , with the average in the east about 200 -lrb- 494 acres -rrb- .
the eu 's common agricultural policy has helped the eastern germans because it gives premiums to farms based on the crops they grow .
eastern german farms would n't have prospered as much as they have without common agricultural policy .
basically , eastern germany will feel 90 percent of the impact of the cuts , and the united kingdom 10 percent , since those are the only regions with farms on that scale .
we 're talking about farms of four-digit number hectares .
for that reason , no single politician would dare to say this is a good proposal .
there are too few jobs in the east , and we ca n't afford to lose any more .
how important is agriculture for the eastern german economy ?
agriculture only represents 3 percent of the gross national product in germany .
but it has been one of the few success stories in east germany following reunification .
we 've experienced a process of deindustrialization that we still have n't recovered from .
there are areas – like the states of mecklenburg-west pomerania and brandenburg – where there are few other jobs outside of agriculture .
east germany still loses tens of thousands of people each year who migrate to the west for jobs , so this is a very big issue psychologically in the east .
how much do eastern german farms stand to lose under the common agricultural policy ?
large farms easily receive € 750,000 -lrb- $ 742,000 -rrb- per year under the current system .
this is not an exception , it applies to many operations in the east .
i have no exact numbers as to how many people might be laid off , but i do know that the lawyers are already working at full speed to break up farms and turn them into smaller units in order to work around the measure if they need to .
in what other ways will the reforms affect german farmers ?
the subsidy cut proposals get a lot of support from certain parts of germany , such as non-governmental organizations and künast .
they would like to see a reduction in funds paid to farmers and they would like to use this money instead to support the rural areas .

montserrat cortinas , wine grower and cattle breeder , galicia , spain although i do not like the current cap , i believe common policies are always important .
historically in spain it has led to modernisation and an important change of structures .
but the as it stands now , the policy has produced perverse effects .
every time there is talk of reform and changes to the cap i feel a certain unease montserrat cortinas the biggest ventures are those who benefit most from the policy .
medium sized ones can no longer compete - they can not buy the rights of production which have artificially high prices .
120 medium-sized farms a day closed their operations in 2001 .
it is having a dramatic social effect , with the loss of agricultural jobs .
there is no longer a place for young people in rural areas .
whole villages are being abandoned , and there are environmental consequences .
i would like the cap to discriminate positively in favour of the true farmers - those who wish to live off their land , not those who have inherited vast stretches of land and often do not even know their workers .
every time there is talk of reform and changes to the cap i feel a certain unease .
it usually means cuts , and i fear it does this time too .
if we want a cohesive europe we do need change , but change with considerations in mind .
harold nytschke , mixed farmer , germany we are very unhappy indeed with the proposals and do n't believe they are fair - either to farmers , or , at the end of the day , to consumers .
we totally reject them .
the cut in subsidies mean we just wo n't be able to compete on the world market .
we 'll have to put our prices up , and then we will lose out because there will be cheaper food which is not of such a high quality coming onto the market from outside .
it may be expensive , but it 's the only way to ensure a fair deal for farmers in the eu harold nytschke , germany at the moment , our farm gets 750,000 euros per year .
under mr fischler 's proposed reforms , we 'll get a maximum of 300,000 euros .
this just is n't enough at a time when costs are going up - we 're having to spend much more on things like fuel , for example .
it 's going to mean big changes for german farmers and the industry generally .
cap is workable .
it may be expensive , but it 's the only way to ensure a fair deal for farmers in the european union .
ruaidhri deasy , sheep and arable farmer , tipperary , ireland " as far as i 'm concerned we will be vetoing the review .
we have a major problem with tearing up an agreement which is only two years in existence .
i do n't want to see any further reform that means farmers and producers will be penalised and money given to other sectors .
i 'm damned if we are going to sit down and renegotiate a deal which the ink is hardly dry on ruaidhri deasy the common agricultural policy was devised to compensate our farmers and i have no doubt that this is more about further funding of the eu .
i do n't believe in any eu reforms before an agreement with the us .
no doubt in 2006 -lrb- the end of the current agreement -rrb- we will have to have more changes .
but i 'm damned if we are going to sit down and renegotiate a deal which the ink is hardly dry on .
bertie aherne has agreed to back us one hundred percent .
i honestly believe a change of government in germany , like recently in france , will help us .
and i know where mr fischer is coming from .
he wants to see change for the benefit of southern european states .
it 's a policy to manicure the ski slopes of austria , but france , ireland and the uk are in a different position .
eric tayleforth , sheep farmer , cumbria , uk because of the type of land that we farm here in the lake district we ca n't compete in the marketplace with our food .
what is costs us to produce food here is a lot higher and therefore cap needs to put more emphasis on the environment .
i think we 've got to work on a system that we are looking after the land on these fells , and there 's got to be some sort of compensation for us , for that kind of farming .
we 've still got to make a living or farmers are just going to leave eric tayleforth they ca n't go on handing out money on the acreage basis , which they have done because it 's just producing more and more sheep and they do n't want them , they want less .
we 've still got to make a living or farmers are just going to leave .
if we lose the skills of looking after the sheep on these fells there 'll be nothing left , once the older farmers give over the younger ones wo n't be interested because there 's no living in it .
we 've got to have a change and i know it 's difficult for them to get a policy that suits everybody and that 's the problem .
these policies that they decide in europe ca n't work in this area , we need a different policy for this environmentally sensitive area .
i also hope they are going to change the policy on foot and mouth , i think they 'll bring in a vaccination policy , which i think we should have had before .
mr langlois-berthelot , grain farmer , normandy , france i am really unhappy for several reasons .
firstly , we thought that in 1999 in berlin there was an agreement that cap would last until 2006 .
this agreement did include a mid-term review to make a few adjustments but the midterm review proposed by franz fischler and the european commission is more than just an adjustment , it 's an important change in agricultural policy .
i am really disappointed because arable farming , we just get one crop each year so we ca n't make changes very quickly and for our investment we need a long-term perspective , so it 's very difficult for me to manage with sudden changes .
i am really disappointed mr langlois-berthelot the eu wants us to become more competitive in global markets , which can be a target , but at the same time their proposals tell us we have to respect an awful lot of new constraints concerning our practises , new regulations which will lead to an increase in cost of production .
for me it 's impossible .
if the reforms are set there will be big changes to farming in france .
my farm will not last like it is now , it 'll have to get bigger and bigger and bigger ad we 'll have less and less farmers .
we 'll have very critical financial situation in farming , if we have a long period to adjust we can probably deal with this but if not , a lot of farmers will have very big problems .

we 've got to have a change and i know it 's difficult for them to get a policy that suits everybody and that 's the problem .
these policies that they decide in europe ca n't work in this area , we need a different policy for this environmentally sensitive area .
i also hope they are going to change the policy on foot and mouth , i think they 'll bring in a vaccination policy , which i think we should have had before .
mr langlois-berthelot , grain farmer , normandy , france i am really unhappy for several reasons .
firstly , we thought that in 1999 in berlin there was an agreement that cap would last until 2006 .
this agreement did include a mid-term review to make a few adjustments but the midterm review proposed by franz fischler and the european commission is more than just an adjustment , it 's an important change in agricultural policy .
i am really disappointed because arable farming , we just get one crop each year so we ca n't make changes very quickly and for our investment we need a long-term perspective , so it 's very difficult for me to manage with sudden changes . "
i am really disappointed " mr langlois-berthelot the eu wants us to become more competitive in global markets , which can be a target , but at the same time their proposals tell us we have to respect an awful lot of new constraints concerning our practises , new regulations which will lead to an increase in cost of production .
for me it 's impossible .
if the reforms are set there will be big changes to farming in france .
my farm will not last like it is now , it 'll have to get bigger and bigger and bigger ad we 'll have less and less farmers .
we 'll have very critical financial situation in farming , if we have a long period to adjust we can probably deal with this but if not , a lot of farmers will have very big problems .

but the trial judge faces a dilemma as he reopens a case which is being seen as part of sierra leone 's peace process .
on his previous appearances in court , the man who led a ferocious rebel movement has appeared confused and frail , his hair grey now and matted in dreadlocks mr sankoh has been unable to find anyone willing to defend him who is also acceptable to the court .
under sierra leone 's law , he has a right to a lawyer .
as the original hearing was adjourned in march , the attorney general appealed to his country 's lawyers to be fearless and to come forward to represent mr sankoh and the other 49 accused .
licence refused a month ago it seemed there had been a breakthrough .
a nigerian lawyer stood beside mr sankoh in court and the case was adjourned for a month to allow him time to obtain a licence to practise law in sierra leone .
it seems he has been refused that licence and the court faces a dilemma when mr sankoh appears again today .
it can not abandon the murder trial but if it continues without defence lawyers , the verdict will be questioned .
mr sankoh says he is not guilty but he could face the death penalty if he is convicted of the murder of 21 people .
they were killed as they demonstrated outside his house in freetown in may 2000 after a peace deal had been signed .
tribunal due on his previous appearances in court , the man who led a ferocious rebel movement has appeared confused and frail , his hair grey now and matted in dreadlocks .
this is unlikely to be the last time he is questioned .
a united nations war crimes tribunal is due to begin work later this year , bringing charges against those it believes were responsible for crimes against humanity .
and earlier this week a truth and reconciliation commission was formally set up .
it is based on the hearings which took place in south africa and it is likely to begin public meetings and statements in three months ' time - one more step in the healing process of a country which tore itself apart .

the company 's confidence is enclosed in a new business plan , which envisages new investment in plants in china , taiwan , the philippines and indonesia .
the idea is to reduce the number of cars being produced in japan - and counteract any risk that a strengthening yen will eat into profitability .
the dollar 's long boom seems to be wearing off amid corporate scandals and a huge us current account deficit , and honda said it wants to be ready .
" excluding japan , the amount of -lrb- honda -rrb- exports going between the regions - america , europe and asia - would increase by three times over the next three years , " said company president hiroyuki yoshino .
" we will have much less dependence on the yen . "
production boost if the plan 's targets are met , honda will increase its global sales by 700,000 to 3.4 million over the next three years .
in the motorcycle arena , the plan is almost to double sales from 6 million to 11 million .
of the new automobiles , 50,000 a year will be built in a new plant in china , helping the company cement its position as the leading japanese carmaker in the country .
taiwan will also get a boost , with the plan seeing honda 's new plant there onstream by the end of this year and building 20,000 cars a year shortly thereafter .
in indonesia , almost $ 70m -lrb- £ 45.1m -rrb- is being invested in a parts unit which should start producing transmissions and valves by the end of 2003 , while the philippines is in line for a $ 16m investment in a transmission plant .
the announcement follows yesterday 's unveiling of plans for 2,000 new jobs in the us thanks to a $ 466m investment in its alabama truck plant .

figures have revealed there were 36 vacancies for full-time theatre nurses in the province at the end of june .
the problem is seen as one of the reasons why northern ireland has the worst hospital waiting lists in the united kingdom .
one factor in cancelling surgery at short notice , or in not arranging it in the first place , is a shortage of nurses who are trained to work in the operating theatre .
in the past , all nurses had the opportunity to work and have a placement in theatres hilary herron royal college of nursing hilary herron of the royal college of nursing said there had long been problems recruiting theatre nurses but a recent change in the overall training regime of nurses had not helped .
" in the past all nurses had the opportunity to work and have a placement in theatres .
" unfortunately that is not the case nowadays and therefore , i see the difficulty in trying to attract nurses into that area , " she said .
the national association of theatre nurses said all nursing students in northern ireland should be offered a dedicated theatre placement .
its spokesperson in the province , mary mcgeough , said that in order to recruit greater numbers of theatre nurses , students had to see the specialities that theatre offered and the contribution it made to patient care .
there are also shortages of nurses to look after patients in intensive care or high dependency after their surgery .
this is also a factor in cutting the number of operations carried out . watch / listen on this story bbc ni 's health correspondent dot kirby : " the work is highly skilled , demanding and stressful " see also : 20 feb 02 -pipe- n ireland ni waiting lists ' worst in europe ' 13 jun 00 -pipe- n ireland ni waiting lists ' highest in uk ' 16 may 02 -pipe- health q & a : nhs waiting lists 08 feb 02 -pipe- health trouble shooters to target cancelled ops 04 feb 02 -pipe- health big jump in cancelled ops internet links : northern ireland department of health royal college of nursing the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top n ireland stories now : nail bombs thrown at station omagh detectives make arrest orde defends inquiry comments warders still concerned at breach sdlp member ' being forced out ' jobs threat at council family claim attack was ' sectarian ' adair fails in prison challenge links to more n ireland stories are at the foot of the page .

kim hong-up , 53 , who denies the allegations , was arrested on 21 june .
he is sharing a jail in seoul with his younger brother kim hong-gul , who is on trial on similar charges .
the presidential office " expressed bottomless regrets toward the people , " presidential spokeswoman park sun-sook said on wednesday .
the growing family scandal has been a huge blow to the president , and he has apologised repeatedly to the nation .
kim hong-up is charged with : taking 2.5 billion won -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- in bribes from six businesses in return for peddling influence among government officials taking 2.2bn won -lrb- $ 1.8m -rrb- in " donations " from businesses , including conglomerates hyundai and samsung , and laundering the money to evade 580m won -lrb- $ 497,000 -rrb- in taxes prosecutors have said that in one case kim hong-gul received $ 819,000 from a construction firm in exchange for helping the company win creditor approval of a debt-relief plan .
family crisis kim hong-up 's brother , 38-year-old kim hong-gul , went on trial last month , also on charges of evading tax and influence peddling .
the growing scandal can not have a direct effect on president kim , as he has just a few months left in office and is constitutionally barred from seeking a second term , but it has badly damaged his reputation .
president kim has apologised to the nation president kim had made the fight against corruption a top priority when he first took office , but a series of corruption scandals involving not only his family , but his top aides , have undermined his credibility .
the scandals has been blamed for the defeat of the governing millennium democratic party , founded by president kim , in june 's local elections .
the polls were seen as a test of voter intentions ahead of key end-of-year presidential elections .
president kim himself is not implicated in any of the scandals , but in south korea , a highly confucian society , the misdeeds of the child are often blamed on the parents .

a proposal to build a third airport for paris on the battlefields of the somme aroused much opposition in northern ireland .
among the graves lie a dozen from irish regiments - young men from all the provinces of ireland - royal munster and dublin fusiliers , royal irish lancers and the famous royal inniskillings .
dr reid visited the somme war graves last week for the annual commemoration and has been raising objections with the authorities in france .
john reid has opposed moving war graves he said : " it is appropriate that in the month when we commemorate the ultimate sacrifice made by so many during the battle of the somme , the threat to their final resting place seems to be diminishing . "
dr ian adamson , chairman of the somme association , welcomed dr reid 's comments .
" john reid should be commended for all the work he has done not only at the airport at chaulmes but also attending the ceremonies last year at guilemont .
" he gave a speech last year which gave a place to the irish nationalist contribution to the somme which is very important because those aspects of our shared inheritance are important today , " he said .
airport problems the cemetery at fouquescourt is one of six which would have to be moved if the third paris airport went ahead .
the proposed site is north of paris 's other airports the french government had said a new complex was needed because the two existing paris airports could not cope with demand .
the governments of canada , australia and the uk have all voiced opposition .
dr adamson said he believed the french government had been swayed by the weight of the arguments against the move .
" it would have been something that the french would have regretted in the long term because they hold verdun in such high esteem in their own history .
" it would have been almost unthinkable that they would n't have afforded the same respect to their allies , " he said . watch / listen on this story dr ian adamson , chairman somme association : " there is a political element to this " see also : 15 nov 01 -pipe- europe paris plans third airport 27 nov 01 -pipe- europe new battle of the somme looms 03 nov 98 -pipe- world war i the somme : hell on earth 06 jun 01 -pipe- business facing the airport overcrowding challenge 19 nov 01 -pipe- europe europe 's airports fly into turbulence internet links : official paris airports website commonwealth war graves commission the battle of the somme the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top n ireland stories now : nail bombs thrown at station omagh detectives make arrest orde defends inquiry comments warders still concerned at breach sdlp member ' being forced out ' jobs threat at council family claim attack was ' sectarian ' adair fails in prison challenge links to more n ireland stories are at the foot of the page .
