they included the party leader , hamma hammami .
human rights groups have complained to the tunisian president about 30 policemen manhandled mr hammami and his comrades from the court in tunis on saturday as their appeal against previously imposed prison sentences was being heard .
mr hammami 's young daughter was injured as she tried to hold on to him .
lawyers described the police action as an abduction and have declared a strike in protest at the police action , to begin next thursday .
a group of 11 european-based human rights groups has sent a letter to the tunisian president , zine el abidine ben ali , expressing their outrage at the proceedings .
' media targeted ' the letter , from groups including reporters sans frontieres ; the swiss rights league and the bar council of england and wales human rights committee , said the court hearing was marked by grave violations of the rule of law and violence against members of the press .
it said security in the court should have been guaranteed by the judge alone , without the intervention of police .
the groups also condemned action taken against the media and demanded that material taken from three french television stations be returned .
picture of hamma hammami , courtesy of amnesty international in 1999 , three of the senior party figures were sentenced in their absence to more than nine years in prison for dissident activity .
the fourth had been given a shorter sentence - again in his absence - in 1997 .
all four were being hunted by police .
they say that their trials were unfair and that they surrendered to the court so they could appeal against their sentences .
the four said they believed pro-democracy opposition forces and human rights groups had grown strong enough to pressure the authorities for a fair trial .
tunisian law allows for people sentenced in absentia to have a retrial when they give themselves up to a court .
but , as international observers looked on , policemen poured into the courtroom and the four accused were taken away .
they were later brought back - in handcuffs and with their shirts torn - after their lawyers had left .
sentences upheld police then dragged them away again after they shouted that they had been beaten , and one of them tried to show marks on his body .
according to reports , hamma hammami and samir taamallah had their original sentences of nine years and three months confirmed .
abdejabbar madouri had the same sentence confirmed plus another two years for contempt of court when he questioned the independence of the judiciary at the hearing .
ammar amroussia had his sentence of two years and three months confirmed .
campaign to continue speaking before his court appearance , mr hammami told french radio that he and his colleagues were not extremists or outlaws , but had " refused to submit to dictatorship ... and repressive laws " .
he said that , even if imprisoned " we will continue the struggle from the darkest corners of our cells " .
human rights groups accuse the tunisian authorities of widespread violations and of using the courts to silence political opponents .
amnesty international press officer george ngwa told bbc news online on saturday that his organisation wanted to see mr hammami have a retrial that was free and fair , and " that meets international standards " .

protesters have again taken to the streets of argentina demanding free access to their bank accounts and the resignation of the government .
the unrest resumed after president eduardo duhalde criticised the supreme court over a ruling that said limits on cash withdrawals from banks were unconstitutional .
the ruling came as the government was putting the finishing touches to its emergency economic rescue plan , due to be announced on saturday .
instead , the president announced the suspension of his rescue plan and said banks would remain closed on monday and tuesday to prevent a run on savings .
he said argentina was now on the brink of anarchy , and he warned that millions of argentines could lose their savings .
should the people of argentina be allowed unrestricted access to their money ?
what can be done to alleviate the economic crisis ?
is president duhalde 's approach a viable economic option ?
have you been personally affected by the crisis ? "
we were in the same situation during our bank freeze in brazil and i know the indignation people are feeling " mariana woisky , brazil / canada it 's difficult to say .
on one hand this brings to memory the bank freeze that former president collor subjected brazilians to in the early 1990s , and i remember how angry people were , it hurt the least advantaged the most .
but then , from a brazilian point of view , i would be afraid if capital flight broke the bank system in argentina , because for sure it would affect my country and the rest of south america , and mercosur would probably collapse .
my father , a civil engineer , is being affected because some of his clients have cancelled projects because of the argentinean crisis .
so if i were to take just brazilian interests in consideration i would approve of the freeze to prevent argentina from collapsing and bringing the rest of us down .
but then , this stance would be hypocritical because we were in the same situation during our bank freeze in brazil and i know the indignation people are feeling .
but i would direct that indignation less towards the argentinean politicians and more towards the imf and world bank , who are comfortably sitting in their offices in dc while argentineans -lrb- and the whole developing world -rrb- languish due to the disastrous economic policies they imposed on our countries .
mariana woisky , brazil / canada what will we do if the government blocks the use of our bank deposits and in between devaluates our currency ?
all this in the middle of a completely unlawful process will drive us over the edge into complete chaos .
francisco diaz , argentina if che guevara could see what has happened to his country now , he would no doubt be supporting the actions of the people against a government that has become a victim of globalisation and the ruthless capitalism that comes with it .
stefan prestedge , england there seems to be an amazing lack of understanding of argentina 's problems in the comments received so far .
comparing this with enron is wrong - the reason the argentine people are facing banking restrictions was because , in the aftermath of the decision to let the peso exchange rate float , there was a serious risk that too many people would try to withdraw too much money from the banks .
if that happened in the uk or us it would cause the collapse of the banks - they simply do n't have the cash lying around to hand over .
the restrictions will be lifted - and you might well criticise the way the government has done this - but to suggest that the money has gone forever -lrb- or has been stolen -rrb- is wrong .
stefan also claims that argentina are the victims of global capitalism .
while i have immense sympathy with the argentine people for the problems they face , argentina faces a debt crisis because the government consistently spent more than it could afford to - not helped by the fact that tax collection in the country is appallingly inefficient .
many of their problems are therefore home grown - to blame investors for refusing to lend more money to argentina is naive to say the least .
richard , us " the present government might as well declare official bankruptcy " fredrik johnson , sweden the money just is not there .
it has already been spent .
basically it all started back with a military dictator named peron .
the money argentina has been living on since then has been borrowed .
the present government might as well declare official bankruptcy because that 's what is going to have to happen for the country to survive .
one can only hope that the people of argentina will survive the experience .
fredrik johnson , sweden there is no other solution in argentina but to have responsible administrators and government officials , which is next to impossible .
people have to change their values and attitudes .
what is amazing in all of this is that billions of dollars disappear and nobody is going to jail .
the same will happen in the enron case and the same has already happened in mexico , brazil , peru and equador .
richard roldan , honduras i lived in argentina back in the 1980s and nothing has changed very much .
you still have corrupt governments who care for themselves and not the people .
the argentine government is in violation of various human rights acts .
it must let the people have their money .

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- drugs trial of stewardess resumes categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 3 february , 2002 , 10:23 gmt drugs trial of stewardess resumes the second trial , under state law , is being held in dubai the second trial of an air stewardess from south wales charged with drugs offences in the united arab emirates is due to resume .
katherine jenkins , 30 , from neath , is being tried along with two other britons , an australian and another woman in connection with what police have called an international drug smuggling ring .
remanded : katherine jenkins still in custody judges in the united arab emirates have called for an investigation into the continued absence of prosecution witnesses which have forced repeated adjournments .
a uk justice watchdog group has criticised the decision to try ms jenkins again after she was cleared of the same charge under islamic law in another part of the country .
she made a fourth court appearance in connection with her new trial on sunday 27 january only for her case to be adjourned to 3 february due to the repeated non-appearance ms jenkins - who was not allowed to return to the uk for her father 's funeral after he died while she was in custody - has persistently denied the charges .
she is being tried along with two other britons , an australian and another woman in connection with what police have called an international drug smuggling ring .
all have pleaded not guilty and ms jenkins has been cleared of similar charges in another uae emirate but her case was transferred to dubai where she was initially arrested .
peter hain : diplomatic efforts as her mp ms jenkins is accused of possessing 50g cocaine , hidden in the roof space of her flat .
she claims she believed the drugs had belonged to the australian defendant in the case , 25-year-old heidi de boer , and hid them after discovering ms de boer had left them in her apartment .
in her first trial at ras al khaimah in the north of the country , held under islamic or sharia law , the judges found the case against her could not be proved .
he case has been taken up by her family 's mp and europe minister peter hain .
he has written to dubai 's leader , sheik mohammad bin rashid , urging him to free ms jenkins on humanitarian grounds .
ms jenkins has been in custody for 15 months since the allegations of drug possession were made against her .
her father vivian , 56 , had died of a heart attack in november , which prompted mr hain 's involvement .
she worked for the dubai-based emirates airline at the time of her arrest and was held in custody over the christmas period at the public prosecution department and appeared in court on 30 december , and 6 and 13 january .
she is being held with two other britons , an australian woman and another woman of unknown nationality .
a uk consular official it is thought is be assisting her .
stephen jakobi , director of fair trials abroad , said : " ms jenkins has been behind bars for 15 months and has always maintained her innocence . "
she was originally tried along with four other britons , an australian and a lebanese .
the court in dubai where ms jenkins faces a second trial two of the british women received life sentences at the original trial .
one of them , anna hamilton , has appealed against her sentence for drug-trafficking .

katherine jenkins , 30 , from neath , is being tried along with two other britons , an australian and another woman in connection with what police have called an international drug smuggling ring .
judges in the united arab emirates have called for an investigation into the continued absence of prosecution witnesses which have forced repeated adjournments .
a uk justice watchdog group has criticised the decision to try ms jenkins again after she was cleared of the same charge under islamic law in another part of the country .
she made a fourth court appearance in connection with her new trial on sunday 27 january only for her case to be adjourned to 3 february due to the repeated non-appearance ms jenkins - who was not allowed to return to the uk for her father 's funeral after he died while she was in custody - has persistently denied the charges .
she is being tried along with two other britons , an australian and another woman in connection with what police have called an international drug smuggling ring .
all have pleaded not guilty and ms jenkins has been cleared of similar charges in another uae emirate but her case was transferred to dubai where she was initially arrested .
ms jenkins is accused of possessing 50g cocaine , hidden in the roof space of her flat .
she claims she believed the drugs had belonged to the australian defendant in the case , 25-year-old heidi de boer , and hid them after discovering ms de boer had left them in her apartment .
in her first trial at ras al khaimah in the north of the country , held under islamic or sharia law , the judges found the case against her could not be proved .
he case has been taken up by her family 's mp and europe minister peter hain .
he has written to dubai 's leader , sheik mohammad bin rashid , urging him to free ms jenkins on humanitarian grounds .
ms jenkins has been in custody for 15 months since the allegations of drug possession were made against her .
her father vivian , 56 , had died of a heart attack in november , which prompted mr hain 's involvement .
she worked for the dubai-based emirates airline at the time of her arrest and was held in custody over the christmas period at the public prosecution department and appeared in court on 30 december , and 6 and 13 january .
she is being held with two other britons , an australian woman and another woman of unknown nationality .
a uk consular official it is thought is be assisting her .
stephen jakobi , director of fair trials abroad , said : " ms jenkins has been behind bars for 15 months and has always maintained her innocence . "
she was originally tried along with four other britons , an australian and a lebanese .
two of the british women received life sentences at the original trial .
one of them , anna hamilton , has appealed against her sentence for drug-trafficking .
the lebanese defendant was jailed for four years , while the cases of the others were transferred to dubai .

the men were airlifted from their boat by an raf sea king helicopter on saturday morning in what was described as " an epic rescue " north of the hebrides .
however , skipper yannick jeog was reported missing after he was swept overboard on friday .
the crew members , who were taken from the french vessel le perrain to stornoway on the isle of lewis , were said to be safe and well .
it was an epic rescue and the helicopter crew had to work at a high rate of knots to get the men off the boat michael mulford , raf kinloss spokesman the rescue operation was mounted as heavy winds and rain caused problems across the uk on saturday .
the conditions were also blamed for the death of a 38-year-old rothesay man who had been travelling on the back of a pick-up truck .
the man was holding onto scaffolding which blew off , dragging him along the road and causing severe head injuries .
the emergency distress signal from the french vessel was received at 1930 gmt on friday .
calculated risk le perrain , which translates as the godfather , is adrift about 250 miles north west of the outer hebrides .
raf nimrods maintained visual contact with the vessel overnight as the ship struggled against 70mph winds and 30ft waves .
raf kinloss spokesman michael mulford said the rescue operation had been a calculated risk .
" the helicopter was operating at its absolute limits and had only a very , very short time left before it had to leave the scene , " he said .
" it was an epic rescue and the helicopter crew had to work at a high rate of knots to get the men off the boat .
" they only had about 15 to 20 minutes to get all the men off the boat so it was certainly a white-knuckle ride . "
the crewmen , who are mainly spanish , were winched from the vessel two at a time as the perrain was thrown around in heavy seas .
mr mulford added that the helicopter 's return journey to stornoway had been helped by strong winds .
' listing severely ' " the helicopter landed at stornoway with just the right amount of fuel - the fuel calculation for its return journey was critical and they got it right , " he said .
" the crew of the fishing boat made the right decision to abandon the vessel and now her fate is in the hands of the sea . "
helicopter pilot flight lieutenant tony gear of raf lossiemouth 's 202 squadron , said the rescue operation had been " a great team effort " .
he said : " we were right out at the very limits of our endurance .
" the ship was listing severely and coming up and down on the water 30ft at a time . "
two of the crew members suffered minor injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment .
the boat 's french skipper yannick jeog , who was lost overboard , came from brittany , where the vessel was registered .
scotland escaped the worst of the weather on saturday , and by sunday morning only three flood warnings remained in force north of the border .
two of these were on the river tay , while the third was on the river tummel downstream of the pitlochry dam .
forecasters predicted that the winds would abate by sunday , although downpours could cause flooding .
the wet conditions are expected to continue into next week .

berthe and francis climbie say they feel let down by britain following the abuse and murder of their eight-year-old daughter .
in their first broadcast interview about one of britain 's worst child abuse cases , they told bbc radio 4 's broadcasting house programme the case was " beyond human understanding " .
they blame british agencies for failing to act on dozens of identifiable injuries on her body - the subject of an ongoing public inquiry .
victoria was killed by her carer and great-aunt marie therese kouao and her boyfriend carl manning in february 2000 after a horrific catalogue of violence .
mrs climbie said that numerous agencies , including ealing and haringey social services , the police child protection unit , and central middlesex and north middlesex hospitals , should have detected the abuse earlier .
she said : " the people i blame , really , are the agencies in this country .
this country is seen as a big country .
" the people who should have come to my daughter 's support and protection were professionals .
today we are still asking the question why berthe climbie " these are people who have been trained to do their job .
" these are people who should have done their job under their policies and procedures , but today we have learned that there has been negligence from them , and because of that they have failed my daughter . "
mr climbie said he thanked the british government for holding the public inquiry which had revealed high levels of negligence .
asked if he would consider legal action beyond the inquiry he said : " we believe the only way things will change is if we continue to pursue those that are responsible for these agencies .
" the hierarchy of these agencies need to pay for the negligence . "
' duped ' mr and mrs climbie travelled from the ivory coast to britain for the public inquiry .
they spoke through a translator for the bbc interview , broadcast on sunday .
victoria 's mother added : " when victoria was in our hands she was very well looked after .
" we might have been poor , but we always had sufficient food to eat , we always had shelter . "
she said the agencies had " passed the buck " rather than take responsibility for failing victoria .
kouao and manning were jailed for life for the murder .
mr climbie said they had had no fears about sending victoria to stay with kouao , who was treated as a grandmother .
he said the education system in europe was highly considered in africa and kouao 's situation offered a good opportunity for victoria .
" we did not see it as any other than a grandmother trying to help her grandchildren , " he added .
" we had high hopes for victoria .

the changes , which would give workers greater flexibility to diversify their company savings accounts , come in response to the enron failure that cost about 20,000 workers many millions of dollars in savings .
" this a matter of fairness , it 's a matter of openness , it 's a matter of respect for the process , " mr bush said .
in a series of proposals to congress , mr bush called for barring executives from selling company stock when workers could not .
under the current laws , enron workers were prevented from selling their company shares as it collapsed last year amid allegations that it misled investors about its accounting practices .
meanwhile top executives were able to bail-out of their holdings .
more reforms mr bush 's proposal would require companies to give workers more frequent updates about their savings plans , known as 401 -lrb- k -rrb- .
enron 's bankruptcy is the subject of criminal and congressional investigations , in part because workers said they did not know the extent of the company 's financial problems and were unable for a few weeks to remove their savings from enron 's 401 -lrb- k -rrb- program .
mr bush has said he was outraged that enron investors were not told more , and he said his mother-in-law lost more than $ 8,000 from investing in company stocks .
however , his proposal would not limit the amount of a workers ' savings plan that could be invested in their employer 's stock .

the changes , which would give workers greater flexibility to diversify their company savings accounts , come in response to the enron failure that cost about 20,000 workers many millions of dollars in savings .
rule changes come too late for former enron employees " this a matter of fairness , it 's a matter of openness , it 's a matter of respect for the process , " mr bush said .
in a series of proposals to congress , mr bush called for barring executives from selling company stock when workers could not .
under the current laws , enron workers were prevented from selling their company shares as it collapsed last year amid allegations that it misled investors about its accounting practices .
meanwhile top executives were able to bail-out of their holdings .
more reforms mr bush 's proposal would require companies to give workers more frequent updates about their savings plans , known as 401 -lrb- k -rrb- .
enron 's bankruptcy is the subject of criminal and congressional investigations , in part because workers said they did not know the extent of the company 's financial problems and were unable for a few weeks to remove their savings from enron 's 401 -lrb- k -rrb- program .
mr bush has said he was outraged that enron investors were not told more , and he said his mother-in-law lost more than $ 8,000 from investing in company stocks .
however , his proposal would not limit the amount of a workers ' savings plan that could be invested in their employer 's stock .
some enron employees put all their 401 -lrb- k -rrb- savings into enron shares .

speaking at a security conference in munich , lord robertson pointedly stressed that , without such improvements , european forces would be unable to operate alongside the us military , limiting the influence of european governments on us policy .
us allies must show a new willingness to develop effective crisis management capabilities lord robertson so far , nato 's practical role in the war against terrorism has been minimal , although nato did dispatch radar-carrying aircraft to the us to assist in air defence and nato troops have also detained alleged islamic militants in the balkans .
but after taking the unprecedented step of declaring the 11 september attacks in new york and washington as an assault on the alliance as a whole , nato largely sat out the war in afghanistan on the sidelines .
us critics lord robertson insisted that the journalists and leader writers who were speculating about nato 's future were wrong , but he did admit that , if the alliance was to remain relevant , change was needed .
robertson : growing technological gap on paper , he said , the europeans ' capabilities were impressive - but in practice hardly any european country could deploy usable and effective forces in significant numbers outside their borders , and sustain them for months or even years , as the alliance needed to do today .
this , he warned , would inevitably have implications for nato cohesion and gave fuel to us critics of europe 's military incapability .
" if we are to ensure that the united states moves neither towards unilateralism , or isolationism , all the known us allies , europeans and canadians , must show a new willingness to develop effective crisis management capabilities , " lord robertson said .
' vital coalition ' the secretary-general 's fear is that a growing technological gap between america and its allies could lead to a growing political gap as well , as washington relies upon its own hi-tech capabilities to go it alone in future military operations .
russia claims bin laden 's influence in chechnya he believes that " the world 's largest permanent coalition " , as he described nato , still has a vital part to play .
indeed , many governments are eager to attach themselves to the anti-terrorist efforts .
the russian defence minister sergei ivanov spoke at length to the conference on this subject , placing russia 's problems in chechnya firmly in the context of the international struggle against terrorism , and insisting on the links between chechen separatists and osama bin laden .

katherine jenkins , 30 , from neath , is being tried in dubai along with two other britons , an australian and another woman in connection with what police have called an international drug smuggling ring .
for the first time in the second trial , prosecution witnesses appeared to give evidence on sunday the case was adjourned until 17 february when further prosecution witnesses are due to give evidence .
judges in the united arab emirates had called for an investigation into the continued absence of the witnesses which had forced repeated adjournments .
the three witnesses gave their evidence in arabic to the three judges hearing the case .
defence lawyers said the case was proceeding well following concerns about the length of time the trial has taken .
previously cleared a uk justice watchdog group has criticised the decision to try ms jenkins again after she was cleared of the same charge under islamic law in another part of the country .
ms jenkins - who was not allowed to return to the uk for her father 's funeral after he died while she was in custody - has persistently denied the charges .
she has been cleared of similar charges in another uae emirate , but her case was transferred to dubai where she was initially arrested .
ms jenkins is accused of possessing 50g cocaine , hidden in the roof space of her flat .
she claims she believed the drugs had belonged to the australian defendant in the case , 25-year-old heidi de boer , and hid them after discovering ms de boer had left them in her apartment .
in her first trial at ras al khaimah in the north of the country , held under islamic or sharia law , the judges found the case against her could not be proved .
he case has been taken up by her family 's mp and europe minister peter hain , who wrote to dubai 's leader , sheik mohammad bin rashid , urging him to free ms jenkins on humanitarian grounds .
ms jenkins has been in custody for 15 months since the allegations of drug possession were made against her .
her father vivian , 56 , had died of a heart attack in november , which prompted mr hain 's involvement .
she worked for the dubai-based emirates airline at the time of her arrest and was held in custody over the christmas period at the public prosecution department and appeared in court on 30 december , and 6 and 13 january .
stephen jakobi , director of fair trials abroad , said : " ms jenkins has been behind bars for 15 months and has always maintained her innocence . "
she was originally tried along with four other britons , an australian and a lebanese .
two of the british women received life sentences at the original trial .
one of them , anna hamilton , has appealed against her sentence for drug-trafficking .
the lebanese defendant was jailed for four years , while the cases of the others were transferred to dubai .
