" last-minute confession " “ after seven years of denial , he admitted his crime at the start of the trial and paid the back taxes , ” state prosecutor matthias musial told the court .
“ this was a last-minute confession . ” prosecutors asked for a sentence of three years and six months in jail for evading taxes from 1991 to 1993 .
a sentence is expected thursday morning . the case revolves around the question of where becker lived during this two-year period when his tennis career was thriving . where was his home ? becker had claimed that he had lived in the tax haven of monaco from 1991 to 1993 .
but becker - who was on a grueling travel schedule at the time - also had an apartment in munich where he occasionally stayed . “ i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " he said .

fdp leader guido westerwelle deemed it " as responsible as it is necessary , " adding that möllemann had saved himself from being sacked .
the fdp ’ s second-in-command in north-rhine westphalia , andreas pinkwart , called on möllemann to give up his mandates in the regional and national parliaments as well . dubious dealings the dam broke loose on friday when party treasurer günter rexrodt announced that möllemann , viewed by many party members as a thorn in the fdp ’ s side , had maintained an illegal party bank account with funds to the tune of 840,000 euros .
according to rexrodt , 145 donations - of which 144 totalled more than 1000 euros - were anonymously paid in cash into 14 different banks .
german law restricts cash donations to 1000 euros , while anonymous donations are limited to 500 euros . möllemann allegedly used the slush fund to pay for the distribution of 8.5 million copies of a campaign brochure critical of israel to households in north-rhine westphalia . populist tendancies möllemann has been repeatedly accused of having populist tendencies .
he launched a campaign to propel the fdp back into government in a coalition with the conservatives , in an optimistic attempt to gain 18 percent votes .
but after the free democrats ' massive failure in the elections , möllemann has been under fire for what many members see as sabotage to the election campaign . earlier this year he was the centre of controversy after accusing the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , of war-mongering .
his campaign brochure which criticised the vice-president of the german jewish community , michael friedman , only made matters worse .
both the brochure and möllemann have been described as " anti-semitic " . health concerns prevent naming names the disgraced politician has so far refused to name donors to the account , despite the monday ultimatum set by party leader westerwelle .
from the canary island , where he is currently recovering from heart problems , möllemann accused members of the fdp leadership of having arranged a “ hunt ” to force his “ political death . ”
möllemann claims that his doctors have prohibited him from engaging in any professional activities until early december , including responding to the allegations against him . according to fdp-treasurer rexrodt , möllemann is able to drive a car , write letters and make announcements , so he should also be able to name names .
“ the resignation won ’ t stop the fdp from uncovering the activities surrounding the special bank account , ” westerwelle told the press . all legal means necessary after a meeting of the fdp leadership in berlin on monday the party leadership announced that if möllemann doesn ’ t reveal the names of the donors within the next few days , it will use all legal mean necessary to force him to name them .

" amber fox " german soldiers were first sent to the former yugoslavian republic of macedonia in august 2001 as part of nato ’ s “ amber fox ” mission .
along with other nato forces , they are responsible for securing peace and protecting osce and eu observers monitoring negotiations between macedonians and ethnic albanians . a nato-brokered peace accord granted the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights and in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament . opinions about the long-term effectiveness of the peace accord differ radically , however .
the u.s. has made clear its intention to end its involvement in the nato mission in macedonia , saying that stability has been achieved .
it is expected to withdraw commitment at the end of 2002 . germany and other key nato members , however , question this analysis .
and it ’ s clear that ethnic tensions remain , as evidenced by occasional shootings and kidnappings by albanian rebels , despite the ongoing presence of some 700 nato troops . the german parliament ’ s overwhelming support of a two-month extension was in part due to the fact that macedonia ’ s recently elected government had requested the extension .
the extended commitment of german troops will cost an estimated 1.5 million euros . eu leadership macedonia plays a strategic role for european integration , and in many ways it is a test case for international peace-keeping efforts . germany led the nato mission in macedonia through june , when holland assumed the lead position .
observers assume that holland will continue its lead position , however , the dutch have yet to make an official commitment . german foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , campaigned on wednesday for the european union to take over the role nato has been playing in macedonia .

" amber fox " german soldiers were first sent to the former yugoslavian republic of macedonia in august 2001 as part of nato ’ s “ amber fox ” mission .
along with other nato forces , they are responsible for securing peace and protecting osce and eu observers monitoring negotiations between macedonians and ethnic albanians . a nato-brokered peace accord granted the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights and in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament . opinions about the long-term effectiveness of the peace accord differ radically , however .
the u.s. has made clear its intention to end its involvement in the nato mission in macedonia , saying that stability has been achieved .

in addition , the photographer has added pictures of still lives and landscapes to his repertoire - including images from his birthplace , berlin . from germany to australia newton is regarded as one of the most important fashion and portrait photographers of the 20th century .
born to a jewish-german button magnate and an american in berlin in 1920 , he began learning his trade from the renowned fashion photographer yva in 1936 .
two years later newton and his family fled nazi germany .
the 18-year old made his way alone to australia via singapore and took part in world war ii on the side of his newly-adopted country . after the war newton set up a studio in melbourne and first published his photos in australian vogue in 1952 .
by 1961 he was spending most of his time shooting fashion in paris .
later , in 1981 , newton “ retired ” to monaco to devote himself to portrait and commercial photography . controversial amazons since turning to photographing mainly nudes in the 1980s newton has frequently stirred up controversy with his images of naked amazons , often gleaming with oil as they engage in banal activities .

fdp leader guido westerwelle deemed it " as responsible as it is necessary , " adding that möllemann had saved himself from being sacked .
the fdp ’ s second-in-command in north-rhine westphalia , andreas pinkwart , called on möllemann to give up his mandates in the regional and national parliaments as well . dubious dealings the dam broke loose on friday when party treasurer günter rexrodt announced that möllemann , viewed by many party members as a thorn in the fdp ’ s side , had maintained an illegal party bank account with funds to the tune of 840,000 euros .
according to rexrodt , 145 donations - of which 144 totalled more than 1000 euros - were anonymously paid in cash into 14 different banks .
german law restricts cash donations to 1000 euros , while anonymous donations are limited to 500 euros . möllemann allegedly used the slush fund to pay for the distribution of 8.5 million copies of a campaign brochure critical of israel to households in north-rhine westphalia . populist tendancies möllemann has been repeatedly accused of having populist tendencies .
he launched a campaign to propel the fdp back into government in a coalition with the conservatives , in an optimistic attempt to gain 18 percent votes .
but after the free democrats ' massive failure in the elections , möllemann has been under fire for what many members see as sabotage to the election campaign . earlier this year he was the centre of controversy after accusing the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , of war-mongering .
his campaign brochure which criticised the vice-president of the german jewish community , michael friedman , only made matters worse .
both the brochure and möllemann have been described as " anti-semitic " . health concerns prevent naming names the disgraced politician has so far refused to name donors to the account , despite the monday ultimatum set by party leader westerwelle .
from the canary island , where he is currently recovering from heart problems , möllemann accused members of the fdp leadership of having arranged a “ hunt ” to force his “ political death . ”
möllemann claims that his doctors have prohibited him from engaging in any professional activities until early december , including responding to the allegations against him . according to fdp-treasurer rexrodt , möllemann is able to drive a car , write letters and make announcements , so he should also be able to name names .

" amber fox " german soldiers were first sent to the former yugoslavian republic of macedonia in august 2001 as part of nato ’ s “ amber fox ” mission .
along with other nato forces , they are responsible for securing peace and protecting osce and eu observers monitoring negotiations between macedonians and ethnic albanians . a nato-brokered peace accord granted the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights and in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament . opinions about the long-term effectiveness of the peace accord differ radically , however .
the u.s. has made clear its intention to end its involvement in the nato mission in macedonia , saying that stability has been achieved .
it is expected to withdraw commitment at the end of 2002 . germany and other key nato members , however , question this analysis .
and it ’ s clear that ethnic tensions remain , as evidenced by occasional shootings and kidnappings by albanian rebels , despite the ongoing presence of some 700 nato troops . the german parliament ’ s overwhelming support of a two-month extension was in part due to the fact that macedonia ’ s recently elected government had requested the extension .
the extended commitment of german troops will cost an estimated 1.5 million euros . eu leadership macedonia plays a strategic role for european integration , and in many ways it is a test case for international peace-keeping efforts . germany led the nato mission in macedonia through june , when holland assumed the lead position .
observers assume that holland will continue its lead position , however , the dutch have yet to make an official commitment . german foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , campaigned on wednesday for the european union to take over the role nato has been playing in macedonia .
if this happens , it would be the first time the european union launched a peace-keeping mission and it would be a significant test case for the eu ’ s common approach to foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the " amber fox " now speaks dutch the netherlands has taken over command of nato 's " amber fox " peacekeeping force in macedonia .
the international force has successfully prevented civil war between slavic and albanian parts of the macedonian population .

the greens are against such an extension and demand the troops ’ removal in the event of a war on iraq .

fdp leader guido westerwelle deemed it " as responsible as it is necessary , " adding that möllemann had saved himself from being sacked .
the fdp ’ s second-in-command in north-rhine westphalia , andreas pinkwart , called on möllemann to give up his mandates in the regional and national parliaments as well . dubious dealings the dam broke loose on friday when party treasurer günter rexrodt announced that möllemann , viewed by many party members as a thorn in the fdp ’ s side , had maintained an illegal party bank account with funds to the tune of 840,000 euros .
according to rexrodt , 145 donations - of which 144 totalled more than 1000 euros - were anonymously paid in cash into 14 different banks .
german law restricts cash donations to 1000 euros , while anonymous donations are limited to 500 euros . möllemann allegedly used the slush fund to pay for the distribution of 8.5 million copies of a campaign brochure critical of israel to households in north-rhine westphalia . populist tendancies möllemann has been repeatedly accused of having populist tendencies .

both the brochure and möllemann have been described as " anti-semitic " . health concerns prevent naming names the disgraced politician has so far refused to name donors to the account , despite the monday ultimatum set by party leader westerwelle .
from the canary island , where he is currently recovering from heart problems , möllemann accused members of the fdp leadership of having arranged a “ hunt ” to force his “ political death . ”
möllemann claims that his doctors have prohibited him from engaging in any professional activities until early december , including responding to the allegations against him . according to fdp-treasurer rexrodt , möllemann is able to drive a car , write letters and make announcements , so he should also be able to name names .

" last-minute confession " “ after seven years of denial , he admitted his crime at the start of the trial and paid the back taxes , ” state prosecutor matthias musial told the court .
“ this was a last-minute confession . ” prosecutors asked for a sentence of three years and six months in jail for evading taxes from 1991 to 1993 .
a sentence is expected thursday morning . the case revolves around the question of where becker lived during this two-year period when his tennis career was thriving . where was his home ? becker had claimed that he had lived in the tax haven of monaco from 1991 to 1993 .
but becker - who was on a grueling travel schedule at the time - also had an apartment in munich where he occasionally stayed . “ i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " he said . " i was permanently on the road .
my office was the whole world .
the ' word ' home didn ’ t really exist for me . ” tax authorities had investigated becker for years , and he was originally charged with withholding taxes of 10.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- .
the trial was for the considerably lower sum of 1.6 million euro for which prosecutors believed they had evidence . countless raids becker told the court on wednesday that the investigations played a role in his decision to retire from tennis .
“ there were countless raids of my house and office , ” becker said .
“ they have been pursuing me for the last six years .
it was a burden .
i haven ’ t won any tournaments since then and ended my career . ” over the course of his tennis career , becker earned $ 25 million in prize money and made millions on endorsements .
since retiring , however , becker had lost much of this to an expensive divorce , a settlement with another woman who had his child and a string of failed businesses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad times for becker former tennis star boris becker could be spending a lot of time in court this year .

fdp leader guido westerwelle deemed it " as responsible as it is necessary , " adding that möllemann had saved himself from being sacked .
the fdp ’ s second-in-command in north-rhine westphalia , andreas pinkwart , called on möllemann to give up his mandates in the regional and national parliaments as well . dubious dealings the dam broke loose on friday when party treasurer günter rexrodt announced that möllemann , viewed by many party members as a thorn in the fdp ’ s side , had maintained an illegal party bank account with funds to the tune of 840,000 euros .
according to rexrodt , 145 donations - of which 144 totalled more than 1000 euros - were anonymously paid in cash into 14 different banks .
german law restricts cash donations to 1000 euros , while anonymous donations are limited to 500 euros . möllemann allegedly used the slush fund to pay for the distribution of 8.5 million copies of a campaign brochure critical of israel to households in north-rhine westphalia . populist tendancies möllemann has been repeatedly accused of having populist tendencies .
he launched a campaign to propel the fdp back into government in a coalition with the conservatives , in an optimistic attempt to gain 18 percent votes .
but after the free democrats ' massive failure in the elections , möllemann has been under fire for what many members see as sabotage to the election campaign . earlier this year he was the centre of controversy after accusing the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , of war-mongering .
his campaign brochure which criticised the vice-president of the german jewish community , michael friedman , only made matters worse .
both the brochure and möllemann have been described as " anti-semitic " . health concerns prevent naming names the disgraced politician has so far refused to name donors to the account , despite the monday ultimatum set by party leader westerwelle .
from the canary island , where he is currently recovering from heart problems , möllemann accused members of the fdp leadership of having arranged a “ hunt ” to force his “ political death . ”
möllemann claims that his doctors have prohibited him from engaging in any professional activities until early december , including responding to the allegations against him . according to fdp-treasurer rexrodt , möllemann is able to drive a car , write letters and make announcements , so he should also be able to name names .
“ the resignation won ’ t stop the fdp from uncovering the activities surrounding the special bank account , ” westerwelle told the press . all legal means necessary after a meeting of the fdp leadership in berlin on monday the party leadership announced that if möllemann doesn ’ t reveal the names of the donors within the next few days , it will use all legal mean necessary to force him to name them .

fdp leader guido westerwelle deemed it " as responsible as it is necessary , " adding that möllemann had saved himself from being sacked .
the fdp ’ s second-in-command in north-rhine westphalia , andreas pinkwart , called on möllemann to give up his mandates in the regional and national parliaments as well . dubious dealings the dam broke loose on friday when party treasurer günter rexrodt announced that möllemann , viewed by many party members as a thorn in the fdp ’ s side , had maintained an illegal party bank account with funds to the tune of 840,000 euros .
according to rexrodt , 145 donations - of which 144 totalled more than 1000 euros - were anonymously paid in cash into 14 different banks .
german law restricts cash donations to 1000 euros , while anonymous donations are limited to 500 euros . möllemann allegedly used the slush fund to pay for the distribution of 8.5 million copies of a campaign brochure critical of israel to households in north-rhine westphalia . populist tendancies möllemann has been repeatedly accused of having populist tendencies .
he launched a campaign to propel the fdp back into government in a coalition with the conservatives , in an optimistic attempt to gain 18 percent votes .
but after the free democrats ' massive failure in the elections , möllemann has been under fire for what many members see as sabotage to the election campaign . earlier this year he was the centre of controversy after accusing the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , of war-mongering .
his campaign brochure which criticised the vice-president of the german jewish community , michael friedman , only made matters worse .
both the brochure and möllemann have been described as " anti-semitic " . health concerns prevent naming names the disgraced politician has so far refused to name donors to the account , despite the monday ultimatum set by party leader westerwelle .
from the canary island , where he is currently recovering from heart problems , möllemann accused members of the fdp leadership of having arranged a “ hunt ” to force his “ political death . ”
möllemann claims that his doctors have prohibited him from engaging in any professional activities until early december , including responding to the allegations against him . according to fdp-treasurer rexrodt , möllemann is able to drive a car , write letters and make announcements , so he should also be able to name names .
“ the resignation won ’ t stop the fdp from uncovering the activities surrounding the special bank account , ” westerwelle told the press . all legal means necessary after a meeting of the fdp leadership in berlin on monday the party leadership announced that if möllemann doesn ’ t reveal the names of the donors within the next few days , it will use all legal mean necessary to force him to name them .
westerwelle emphasized that möllemann ’ s work for the fdp is over “ for the long term . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fdp leader issues ultimatum to state leader in anti-semitism flap the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp .

" amber fox " german soldiers were first sent to the former yugoslavian republic of macedonia in august 2001 as part of nato ’ s “ amber fox ” mission .
along with other nato forces , they are responsible for securing peace and protecting osce and eu observers monitoring negotiations between macedonians and ethnic albanians . a nato-brokered peace accord granted the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights and in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament . opinions about the long-term effectiveness of the peace accord differ radically , however .
the u.s. has made clear its intention to end its involvement in the nato mission in macedonia , saying that stability has been achieved .
it is expected to withdraw commitment at the end of 2002 . germany and other key nato members , however , question this analysis .
and it ’ s clear that ethnic tensions remain , as evidenced by occasional shootings and kidnappings by albanian rebels , despite the ongoing presence of some 700 nato troops . the german parliament ’ s overwhelming support of a two-month extension was in part due to the fact that macedonia ’ s recently elected government had requested the extension .
the extended commitment of german troops will cost an estimated 1.5 million euros . eu leadership macedonia plays a strategic role for european integration , and in many ways it is a test case for international peace-keeping efforts . germany led the nato mission in macedonia through june , when holland assumed the lead position .
observers assume that holland will continue its lead position , however , the dutch have yet to make an official commitment . german foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , campaigned on wednesday for the european union to take over the role nato has been playing in macedonia .

fdp leader guido westerwelle deemed it " as responsible as it is necessary , " adding that möllemann had saved himself from being sacked .
the fdp ’ s second-in-command in north-rhine westphalia , andreas pinkwart , called on möllemann to give up his mandates in the regional and national parliaments as well . dubious dealings the dam broke loose on friday when party treasurer günter rexrodt announced that möllemann , viewed by many party members as a thorn in the fdp ’ s side , had maintained an illegal party bank account with funds to the tune of 840,000 euros .
according to rexrodt , 145 donations - of which 144 totalled more than 1000 euros - were anonymously paid in cash into 14 different banks .
german law restricts cash donations to 1000 euros , while anonymous donations are limited to 500 euros . möllemann allegedly used the slush fund to pay for the distribution of 8.5 million copies of a campaign brochure critical of israel to households in north-rhine westphalia . populist tendancies möllemann has been repeatedly accused of having populist tendencies .
he launched a campaign to propel the fdp back into government in a coalition with the conservatives , in an optimistic attempt to gain 18 percent votes .
but after the free democrats ' massive failure in the elections , möllemann has been under fire for what many members see as sabotage to the election campaign . earlier this year he was the centre of controversy after accusing the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , of war-mongering .
his campaign brochure which criticised the vice-president of the german jewish community , michael friedman , only made matters worse .
both the brochure and möllemann have been described as " anti-semitic " . health concerns prevent naming names the disgraced politician has so far refused to name donors to the account , despite the monday ultimatum set by party leader westerwelle .
from the canary island , where he is currently recovering from heart problems , möllemann accused members of the fdp leadership of having arranged a “ hunt ” to force his “ political death . ”
möllemann claims that his doctors have prohibited him from engaging in any professional activities until early december , including responding to the allegations against him . according to fdp-treasurer rexrodt , möllemann is able to drive a car , write letters and make announcements , so he should also be able to name names .
“ the resignation won ’ t stop the fdp from uncovering the activities surrounding the special bank account , ” westerwelle told the press . all legal means necessary after a meeting of the fdp leadership in berlin on monday the party leadership announced that if möllemann doesn ’ t reveal the names of the donors within the next few days , it will use all legal mean necessary to force him to name them .
westerwelle emphasized that möllemann ’ s work for the fdp is over “ for the long term . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fdp leader issues ultimatum to state leader in anti-semitism flap the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp .

" amber fox " german soldiers were first sent to the former yugoslavian republic of macedonia in august 2001 as part of nato ’ s “ amber fox ” mission .
along with other nato forces , they are responsible for securing peace and protecting osce and eu observers monitoring negotiations between macedonians and ethnic albanians . a nato-brokered peace accord granted the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights and in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament . opinions about the long-term effectiveness of the peace accord differ radically , however .
the u.s. has made clear its intention to end its involvement in the nato mission in macedonia , saying that stability has been achieved .
it is expected to withdraw commitment at the end of 2002 . germany and other key nato members , however , question this analysis .
and it ’ s clear that ethnic tensions remain , as evidenced by occasional shootings and kidnappings by albanian rebels , despite the ongoing presence of some 700 nato troops . the german parliament ’ s overwhelming support of a two-month extension was in part due to the fact that macedonia ’ s recently elected government had requested the extension .
the extended commitment of german troops will cost an estimated 1.5 million euros . eu leadership macedonia plays a strategic role for european integration , and in many ways it is a test case for international peace-keeping efforts . germany led the nato mission in macedonia through june , when holland assumed the lead position .
observers assume that holland will continue its lead position , however , the dutch have yet to make an official commitment . german foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , campaigned on wednesday for the european union to take over the role nato has been playing in macedonia .
if this happens , it would be the first time the european union launched a peace-keeping mission and it would be a significant test case for the eu ’ s common approach to foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the " amber fox " now speaks dutch the netherlands has taken over command of nato 's " amber fox " peacekeeping force in macedonia .

" amber fox " german soldiers were first sent to the former yugoslavian republic of macedonia in august 2001 as part of nato ’ s “ amber fox ” mission .
along with other nato forces , they are responsible for securing peace and protecting osce and eu observers monitoring negotiations between macedonians and ethnic albanians . a nato-brokered peace accord granted the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights and in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament . opinions about the long-term effectiveness of the peace accord differ radically , however .
the u.s. has made clear its intention to end its involvement in the nato mission in macedonia , saying that stability has been achieved .
it is expected to withdraw commitment at the end of 2002 . germany and other key nato members , however , question this analysis .
and it ’ s clear that ethnic tensions remain , as evidenced by occasional shootings and kidnappings by albanian rebels , despite the ongoing presence of some 700 nato troops . the german parliament ’ s overwhelming support of a two-month extension was in part due to the fact that macedonia ’ s recently elected government had requested the extension .
the extended commitment of german troops will cost an estimated 1.5 million euros . eu leadership macedonia plays a strategic role for european integration , and in many ways it is a test case for international peace-keeping efforts . germany led the nato mission in macedonia through june , when holland assumed the lead position .
observers assume that holland will continue its lead position , however , the dutch have yet to make an official commitment . german foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , campaigned on wednesday for the european union to take over the role nato has been playing in macedonia .
if this happens , it would be the first time the european union launched a peace-keeping mission and it would be a significant test case for the eu ’ s common approach to foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the " amber fox " now speaks dutch the netherlands has taken over command of nato 's " amber fox " peacekeeping force in macedonia .

fdp leader guido westerwelle deemed it " as responsible as it is necessary , " adding that möllemann had saved himself from being sacked .
the fdp ’ s second-in-command in north-rhine westphalia , andreas pinkwart , called on möllemann to give up his mandates in the regional and national parliaments as well . dubious dealings the dam broke loose on friday when party treasurer günter rexrodt announced that möllemann , viewed by many party members as a thorn in the fdp ’ s side , had maintained an illegal party bank account with funds to the tune of 840,000 euros .
according to rexrodt , 145 donations - of which 144 totalled more than 1000 euros - were anonymously paid in cash into 14 different banks .
german law restricts cash donations to 1000 euros , while anonymous donations are limited to 500 euros . möllemann allegedly used the slush fund to pay for the distribution of 8.5 million copies of a campaign brochure critical of israel to households in north-rhine westphalia . populist tendancies möllemann has been repeatedly accused of having populist tendencies .
he launched a campaign to propel the fdp back into government in a coalition with the conservatives , in an optimistic attempt to gain 18 percent votes .
but after the free democrats ' massive failure in the elections , möllemann has been under fire for what many members see as sabotage to the election campaign . earlier this year he was the centre of controversy after accusing the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , of war-mongering .
his campaign brochure which criticised the vice-president of the german jewish community , michael friedman , only made matters worse .
both the brochure and möllemann have been described as " anti-semitic " . health concerns prevent naming names the disgraced politician has so far refused to name donors to the account , despite the monday ultimatum set by party leader westerwelle .
from the canary island , where he is currently recovering from heart problems , möllemann accused members of the fdp leadership of having arranged a “ hunt ” to force his “ political death . ”
möllemann claims that his doctors have prohibited him from engaging in any professional activities until early december , including responding to the allegations against him . according to fdp-treasurer rexrodt , möllemann is able to drive a car , write letters and make announcements , so he should also be able to name names .
“ the resignation won ’ t stop the fdp from uncovering the activities surrounding the special bank account , ” westerwelle told the press . all legal means necessary after a meeting of the fdp leadership in berlin on monday the party leadership announced that if möllemann doesn ’ t reveal the names of the donors within the next few days , it will use all legal mean necessary to force him to name them .

on tuesday , mr takenaka postponed the release of a plan to tackle the mountain of non-performing loans , after running into opposition from some government officials .
but mr takenaka said the final version of the plan would not be watered down , and claimed the full backing of prime minister junichiro koizumi .
a plan to deal with bad debt is seen as a crucial first step if japan is to kick-start its economy , mired in recession for the past decade .
crisis of confidence mr koizumi told a cabinet meeting early on wednesday that the government should work as a team to push through any reforms suggested by mr takenaka .
the minister is reportedly to meet the heads of 12 major banks later on wednesday to discuss bad loans .
opposition to the takenaka plan centres around the effect on the stock market , which has plumbed a series of 19-year lows since he was put in charge of banking at the end of september .
investors are concerned that a rescue plan would necessarily involve a huge injection of public funds , and could destroy some of the financial institutions that knit together the country 's economy .
there are also question-marks over mr takenaka 's style , which is seen as somewhat too abrupt for the sedate world of japanese politics .
political problems the extent of opposition to mr takenaka 's reform is still unclear .
although his tuesday plan was postponed after meeting officials from the ruling liberal democratic party , he denies that politics played a significant role .
instead , the official line is that a bank-rescue plan is to be co-ordinated with a wider package of measures to stimulate the economy and cushion the impact of any financial-sector job losses .
finance minister masajuro shiokawa , who has given his guarded support to mr takenaka , has said he may consider drawing up a supplementary budget if necessary .
