his second book ash wednesday is out this week and ethan was on breakfast .
he said : " ash wednesday " is about orientation and change .
i have done acting , directing and writing , but not all simultaneously .
i am content , my role in " dead poets society " was fluke , it led to many roles being offered to me. acting is great complement to writing .
i make up a ritual for myself , as you have to be disciplined .
click here to watch our interview with ethan hawke .
if you want to read more on ethan hawke , the bbc 's entertainment correspondent tom brook sent this report when ethan hawke won an oscar nomination earlier this year .
by entertainment correspondent tom brook ethan hawke was as surprised as everyone else when he won a supporting actor oscar nomination for his role as the young idealistic cop jake hoyt in training day .
critics had praised his performance opposite denzel washington in this intense police corruption drama .
but his name had n't really surfaced in lists of possible nominees .
hawke plays a rookie cop put to the test by his corrupt new boss hawke says : " i feel really lucky because i was so completely not expecting it .
" if you are expecting it then you might be disappointed if you do n't get it . "
the 31-year-old american , who is married to the actress uma thurman , has an impressive list of screen credits .
in the last 15 years he has appeared in some 30 features .
he appeared in the futuristic gattaca in 1977 .
in snow falling on cedars in 1999 , he played a pensive journalist and then took the title role in hamlet in 2000 .
esteem hawke maintains he 's trying to keep his oscar nomination in perspective .
" it is not to be taken too seriously .
it does n't make your performance any better or any worse if you did n't get nominated , so you try to keep an even keel . "
i admire him a lot , i like his work and , you know , you ca n't try to match somebody like that ethan hawke on denzel washington despite being recognised in the supporting actor category , hawke 's time on screen matches that of his co-star denzel washington , nominated for best actor .
hawke plays an honest rookie cop who is put through hell in one 24-hour cycle working alongside a corrupt undercover officer trying to see if he has the mettle to join his ranks .
washington plays a larger than life figure .
he is an out-of-control officer called alonzo harris , who is corrupt but also very charismatic .
hawke says he did n't try to match washington 's onscreen magnetism .
" his presence is so powerful that to compete with him would be foolish " he says .
" i admire him a lot , i like his work and , you know , you ca n't try to match somebody like that .
you just try to do your best and hope the movie works . "
rogues training day is high-octane action-packed entertainment .
but hawke believes it also shines the spotlight on the police corruption plaguing many american cities .
hawke is married to the actress uma thurman " it 's certainly a window into it , it certainly opens up a discussion , " he says .
" it shows people a little bit of how it does happen , how it could happen . "
he adds : " a lot of the stuff some of the police officers in the last couple of years have been accused of is a lot worse than anything that happens in this movie . "
in the wake of 11 september police , and firefighters , have become national heroes in america .
training day shows rogue out-of-control cops at work in the streets of los angeles .
but hawke points out " the bulk of all police officers are very serious men dedicated to serving us " .
most oscar odds-makers say hawke is a long shot to win an award but the nomination alone has raised his profile .
he does n't appear to have a shortage of work but he admits he wouldn Â¿ t object if the nomination brought some interesting scripts his way .
" i hope so .
i want some good jobs .
what else can i say ? "

according to the mirror it is the question we are all asking , why is david and victoria beckham 's new baby son called romeo .
one name many of the papers come up with is the obscure dutch footballer , romeo zondervan , a one-time ipswich midfielder .
but he has competition for providing the inspiration behind the unusual name .
the sun lists rap star romeo dunn , the town of romeo , michigan , and even an alfa romeo .
celebrity already in an editorial , the daily telegraph says that our names define us , and breathe a parent 's aspirations into their child .
but it points out that there is no guarantee that famous offspring will stick with a given name .
david bowie 's son , zowie , it says , is now just plain duncan .
a cartoon in the express combines the story with the other great interest of the tabloid papers , itv 's latest reality game show .
it shows romeo waiting in the womb and thinking : " i 'm a celebrity , get me out of here " .
climate change the guardian leads its front page with what it calls tony blair 's " unexpected broadside " against george bush on the issue of climate change .
it calls the prime minister 's remarks a calculated attempt to embarrass the president over the kyoto agreement , and to show that britain is not slavishly loyal to the us .
the times thinks mr blair has staked his environmental reputation on brokering a deal at the world summit in johannesburg .
but it wants him to address a different issue when he arrives in south africa on monday - zimbabwe .
mugabe question it says his silence on president mugabe 's wilful destruction of a prosperous society would destroy british credibility as an agent for good in africa .

according to the mirror it is the question we are all asking , why is david and victoria beckham 's new baby son called romeo .
one name many of the papers come up with is the obscure dutch footballer , romeo zondervan , a one-time ipswich midfielder .
but he has competition for providing the inspiration behind the unusual name .
the sun lists rap star romeo dunn , the town of romeo , michigan , and even an alfa romeo .
celebrity already in an editorial , the daily telegraph says that our names define us , and breathe a parent 's aspirations into their child .
but it points out that there is no guarantee that famous offspring will stick with a given name .
david bowie 's son , zowie , it says , is now just plain duncan .
a cartoon in the express combines the story with the other great interest of the tabloid papers , itv 's latest reality game show .
it shows romeo waiting in the womb and thinking : " i 'm a celebrity , get me out of here " .
climate change the guardian leads its front page with what it calls tony blair 's " unexpected broadside " against george bush on the issue of climate change .
it calls the prime minister 's remarks a calculated attempt to embarrass the president over the kyoto agreement , and to show that britain is not slavishly loyal to the us .
the times thinks mr blair has staked his environmental reputation on brokering a deal at the world summit in johannesburg .
but it wants him to address a different issue when he arrives in south africa on monday - zimbabwe .
mugabe question it says his silence on president mugabe 's wilful destruction of a prosperous society would destroy british credibility as an agent for good in africa .
the point is pursued by the the daily mail , which condemns new labour as " shamefully hypocritical " .
it says corrupt dictators are the most obvious reason for much of the poverty in the developing world , and must be confronted .
double jeopardy the metropolitan police commissioner , sir john stevens , has told the the independent that any change in the law on double jeopardy - when someone can not be tried twice for the same crime - will be used to bring new charges over the murders of stephen lawrence and damilola taylor .

the pilot scheme will be in use throughout denbighshire and conwy , from midnight on sunday , for the next 12 months .
the scheme will allow police officers more flexibility in the way that offenders are dealt with chief inspector mike mullis the scheme - the first of its kind in wales - lets officers issue people , caught causing nuisance crimes , with a fixed penalty ticket of between Â£ 40 and Â£ 80 .
the initiative is already being trialled in the west midlands , essex and the croydon division of the metropolitan police .
under the scheme , police officers will not lose the power to bring an individual to court but will be able to use the notices for minor violations .
these offences include : being drunk on the highway raising a false alarm to the fire brigade trespassing on a railway throwing fireworks in a public place wasting police time throwing stones at trains attempting to buy alcohol in a pub for someone under 18 disorderly while drunk causing annoyance over the telephone using threatening words or behaviour chief inspector mike mullis of north wales police said that officers throughout the division had undergone rigorous training for the initiative .
" this scheme will enable us to improve the quality of life for the communities we serve and will help us to reduce the fear of crime within the two counties , " he said .
" it will also allow police officers more flexibility in the way that offenders are dealt with .
street patrols will impact on nuisance crimes " it should go some way to lighten the paperwork load , both officers and support staff have to complete under the present system . "
chief inspector mullis will be monitoring the on-the-spot fine system to see if the amount of crime committed is cut .
" i will constantly be assessing the scheme over the coming months and will be keeping a close eye on the number of tickets dispatched and the number of offences , and will be comparing them to the figures for last year .
" that information will then be forwarded to the home office , " he added .
the scheme was introduced in the three other forces on 12 august .
delays in implementing the scheme in north wales were caused by tickets not being printed in both welsh and english languages .
the scheme is in accordance with the human rights act , as people issued with a fixed-penalty notice are able to seek trial if they challenge the fine . watch / listen on this story bbc wales ' rhodri hornung " this scheme will tackle problems on the streets of north wales " see also : 12 aug 02 -pipe- england spot fines get mixed reception 12 aug 02 -pipe- uk spot fines ' infringement of rights ' 04 jul 00 -pipe- uk papers mock blair 's spot fines u-turn 19 aug 02 -pipe- england ' foolish story ' leads to spot fine 13 aug 02 -pipe- england drunken pensioner given spot fine 12 aug 02 -pipe- uk spot fines for anti-social behaviour internet links : north wales police the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : boyfriend sought in murder inquiry girl will wait for jailed ' rapist ' lover cash boost for brecon jazz hello !

but the news of potential cooperation between the two rivals comes as fierce opposition to hershey 's sale is growing in the us .
pennsylvania-based hershey , whose brands include such american favourites as reese 's peanut butter cups and hershey 's kisses , has been put up for sale by the milton hershey school trust .
but two lawsuits have already been filed against the sale , including one from an association for orphan ex-pupils of a school set up by the firm 's founder .
on tuesday , a court is expected to hear a motion from pennsylvania 's attorney-general attempting to halt the sale .
local residents are planning to protest outside the courtroom , according to the financial times .
biding their time the controversy is likely to dampen any enthusiasm for an immediate tie-up between nestle and cadbury .
analysts are already speculating that the firms would split hershey 's key brands between them after a deal is reached .
nestle 's chief executive , peter brabeck , has already signalled that the deal could run into regulatory problems if the swiss giant acquires the whole firm .
it would also weigh heavily on the firm 's debt-heavy balance sheet .
analysts also said that nestle may agree the deal and then sell the brands onto cadbury in order to ease negotiations .

the meeting was postponed last wednesday after one of the workforce at fishguard died suddenly .
colleagues decided to close the factory until monday as a mark of respect for the woman , who had worked there for 30 years .
up to 200 jobs will be lost when the site - the last of dewhirst 's factories in wales - shuts its doors .
dewhirst has made a strategic decision to withdraw from manufacturing in wales in a move to increase profits .
a 90-day consultation period at fishguard is set to begin , during which time all agencies involved in the operation will search for an alternative to closing the site .
however , union officials have admitted they are unlikely to succeed given the previous closures of dewhirst 's other factory sites .
dewhirst is the latest in a long line of employers to pull out of west wales .
in may , itv digital closed its call centre in pembroke dock with the loss of 900 jobs and in 1995 , 500 were made redundant when the armaments depot at trecwn closed down .
first minister rhodri morgan told bbc wales that the assembly would search far and wide to find replacement jobs .
efforts will focus on helping jobs elsewhere for the staff from fishguard and dewhirst plants in cardigan , and swansea .
" we have got to devise a plan in order to find alternative clothing suppliers who will want to utilise the workforce , or devise an alternative future away from the clothing industry , " he said .
dewhirst makes clothes for marks & spencer and has been badly affected by the withdrawal of orders by the company .
regrets the latest losses bring the total number of dewhirst job losses in wales to around 1,400 .
in a statement the company said it regretted the move .
it said continued consumer pressure on prices had affected profitability .
gmb spokesperson emily thomas said the union would be looking for meetings with the welsh assembly to assist the workers .
" we will spend the 90-day consultation period trying to work out every way for them to keep their jobs or get trained for other jobs - they 're a highly skilled workforce , " she said .
the gmb wants manufacturers and the government to develop strategies to save jobs in the sector , including getting contracts for public sector worker uniforms such as nurses , emergency and military staff .

bbc news online looks at the pros and cons of buying new and how to ensure the best possible deal .
does buying new make sense ?
some would suggest not , because in many cases as soon as the new owner drives their pride and joy off the dealer forecourt it can fall in value by thousands .
depreciation is at its greatest when a car is new .
in fact , 50 % can be wiped of the value of a new car within a year of first registration .
yet this does n't deter buyers .
according to the society of motor manufacturers & traders -lrb- smmt -rrb- , a record 2.4 million new cars were sold in the uk in 2001 - an increase of 10 % on the 2000 figure .
how can buyers avoid being hit hard by depreciation ?
as a rule of thumb , prestige brands and new models tend to depreciate the least .
conversely , mass-market brands and old models can lose value at breakneck speed .
however , to confuse matters more , models that are being discontinued and mass-market brands are often more attractively priced .
most car dealers would recommend buyers go for inoffensive colours such as blues and silvers rather than quirky , bright , or off-the-wall shades of yellow , orange or purple .
as for interior design , care has to be taken .
after all a leopard skin pattern on the seats might not appeal to others when it comes time to sell the car on .
can buyers twist the arm of dealers into lowering prices ?
fortunately for bargain-hungry buyers there is an oversupply of cars in europe and the market is ultra-competitive .
new car prices have fallen by more than 10 % on average in the uk over the past two years .
nevertheless , with car prices embodying " rip-off britain " for many , buyers have got used to haggling .
for many buyers , a car 's list price - the car equivalent of the recommended retail price - is increasingly being used as a starting point from which to haggle downwards .
any bargaining tips ?
the message from the smmt is that buyers need to do their homework .
negotiating a large discount off the list price is great but can be negated if the dealer is able to get away with offering a below-market rate for a car being traded in .
nearly two-thirds of private new car buyers have a vehicle to trade in .
the difference between the new car price and the trade in value is called the " cost to change " .
ensure the lowest cost to change by visiting several dealers , comparing prices , and consulting parkers and glasses car price guides which give the low-down on going trade-in rates .
are high street dealers tied to a single manufacturer the only place to buy new ?
absolutely not .
recent years have seen the rise of online dealers and out-of-town car supermarkets .
they both have the advantage of selling more than one brand and , as they buy in bulk , prices are often lower than list .
and that 's not all .
many uk car buyers - tempted by lower list prices - choose to buy their vehicles from the continent .
buying abroad sounds risky ?
thousands of britons do it every year without a hitch but buying abroad is not to be undertaken lightly .
first , there are language and currency barriers to overcome .
also if something is n't right with the car at collection time it can be a problem to get the dealer to put things right .
in addition , the paperwork can be onerous as the car has to be certified as roadworthy for the uk - for example , it has to have the required number of seat belts fitted - and transit plates have to be paid for at a cost of Â£ 150-200 .
and vat is payable on the car when it is imported into the uk .
however , a 12-month warranty applies irrespective of which eu country the car is bought from .
nevertheless , if all that seems like too much fuss , there are car brokers in the uk that will import cars to order .
going through a car broker has the advantage that the sale is subject to uk consumer laws such as the sale of goods act .
what finance options are there ?
many private buyers fund their new car purchase with some form of borrowing .
taking out an unsecured personal loan or hire purchase are the two traditional ways of funding a new car purchase .
however , in recent years , more flexible repayment plans have started to come to the fore .
most manufacturers now operate personal contract plans -lrb- pcps -rrb- .
under this type of scheme the repayment schedule is split into three very distinct parts .
first , a deposit is paid - usually 10 % of the cars value .
this is followed by 36 or 48 monthly instalments .
at the end of the term , a pre-agreed single lump sum payment is made by the borrower to clear the debt .
however , borrowers do have the choice , once the instalment stage is finished , to simply hand back the car with nothing more to pay .

the eu has also made it clear it wants differences with iraq to be resolved through diplomacy rather than war .
prime minister tony blair is coming under growing pressure to give a clear explanation of whether and why britain would back an attack on iraq by the united states .
there has been no let up in demands from the left and the right but mr blair , on a three-day visit to africa , says he will only answer further questions when he returns to the uk on tuesday .
everything has to be done to avoid war tam dalyell , labour mp the conservative chairman , theresa may , has reinforced warnings from party leader iain duncan smith that saddam hussein had the motive and probably the ability to launch a missile attack against britain .
she promised the conservatives were ready to back an american-led offensive to destroy any iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
" he knows iraq poses a clear and growing danger to britain , " she told the bbc 's breakfast with frost programme .
" if the prime minister believes it is necessary to take action against iraq to enforce the un resolutions and eliminate weapons of mass destruction then we will give him that backing . "
restraining influence meanwhile , union leaders and left-wing labour mps have become equally concerned by the government 's refusal to publish a detailed assessment of the risks posed by saddam hussein .
veteran labour mp tam dalyell said parliament should be recalled to discuss the issue , when mr blair returns to the uk .
" everything has to be done to avoid war , " mr dalyell told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" the house of commons should be able to registers a yes or no as soon as possible . "
he said it was important to " let the americans know what the british attitude is " before " events take over " .
roger lyons , joint general secretary of trade union amicus , said he would be putting forward draft motion to the tuc executive calling on the government to act as a restraining influence on the us .
evidence needed the transport workers ' leader , bill morris , said he hoped mr blair will explain his unwavering support for president george bush , otherwise he says the prime minister could expect some blunt advice at the forthcoming tuc and labour conferences .
blair said doing nothing was not an option baroness williams , the liberal democrats ' leader in the lords , told the bbc 's breakfast with frost that even us secretary of state colin powell had admitted the bush administration had yet to make the case for military action .

iraqi vice president is sending emissaries to europe it has been confirmed that defence secretary geoff hoon will spend six days in the united states later this month and will be briefed by the us defence secretary , donald rumsfeld .

iraq , meanwhile is preparing to send emissaries to europe to rally support against the threat of an american attack .
the european union has made it clear it wants differences with iraq to be resolved through diplomacy rather than war and it has called on iraq to re-admit un weapons inspectors .

" give us a chance before declaring war and devastating the country .
" encourage the un and strengthen the hand of -lrb- un secretary general -rrb- kofi annan for a peaceful solution . "

his last day as a breakfast presenter will be thursday september 5 , when we 'll be looking back at some of the highlights of his time with us we have already put some of your questions to him , in a special on-line forum .
click here to watch our forum with jeremy and co - presenter sophie raworth jeremy has also written a special farewell piece for us : the biggest story in the last two years was , of course , september 11th 2001 .
as soon as planes were flying again to north america -lrb- we could only get to montreal and had to drive down to new york -rrb- , i went out with a team from breakfast to present the programme .
it felt strange to be sitting in the studio ... a bit like i had stumbled into someone else 's job it was just a few days after the attacks .
the shock and horror of what had happened were still very fresh .
outside hospitals and other public buildings there were thousands of cards describing people who were lost .
their families and friends were still hoping that they would turn up , perhaps with amnesia , in some hospital bed .
middle east turmoil the other big world story in the last two years has been the crisis in the middle east .
since i left jerusalem only a few days before i started on breakfast , it felt strange to be sitting in the studio when i was used to being at the scene .
i did , at that time , feel a bit like i had stumbled into someone else 's job .
some of the biggest highlights for me come from the viewers .
i have had some wonderful letters and messages from people which have been really touching , or funny or just unusual .
i admire anyone who has the energy to send an email or a text message at that time of the day .
i am also really pleased and amazed that people want to use up some of their time to contact me .
i will miss a lot about the programme .
it is a privilege to be able to share some of the morning with our viewers .
i do n't expect to miss getting up at 3.30 and going to bed at half past eight .
i 'll miss the excellent and charming journalists , make-up people , drivers , studio and gallery staff who make breakfast happen every day .
and of course i 'll miss working with sophie .
it was nice for a couple of years to be among britain 's most envied men .
we 're great friends - and while we wo n't have breakfast together quite as often , lunch - or even dinner - involving going out till at least 1030 is quite a prospect .

the american-based newsweek publication says newcastle , and its neighbouring town gateshead , are among the most cultural towns and cities in the world .
they were the only british entries on the list , which also included cape town , in south africa , and marseille , in france .
gateshead and newcastle 's joint bid to secure the title of european capital of culture in 2008 has catapulted tyneside into the international spotlight .
the world 's new culture meccas austin , texas , usa tijuana , mexico cape town , s africa zhongguancun , china antwerp , belgium newcastle / gateshead , uk kabul , afghanistan marseille , france the " blinking eye " millennium bridge , baltic centre for contemporary art and the angel of the north are some of the developments that helped to capture the imagination .
gateshead borough council spearheaded the millennium bridge , pushed through the transformation of the former baltic mill and is currently masterminding a multi-million pound music centre on the banks of the gateshead quays .
the new edition of newsweek - which is read by more than 19m people - coincided with visits to tyneside from the judging panel for the capital of culture bid .
the magazine 's 2 september issue describes newcastle and gateshead as " new centres of culture and vitality " .
other mentions were austin , texas , tijuana in mexico , and antwerp in belgium .
the baltic opened to the public in july councillor mick henry of gateshead council said : " it is fantastic news that one of the world 's most well-respected news and current affairs magazines has given gateshead and newcastle this stunning accolade .
" it is not just something that local people have noticed and benefited from , it is something that has been recognised and applauded across the whole world .
" but our bid with newcastle to be awarded that cultural title is much , much more than just about those major developments .
" it is about getting tens of thousands of people across the region involved in arts , sport , culture and learning every day . "
" when newcastle and gateshead are hopefully awarded the european capital of culture 2008 title , it will mean that the region can expect millions of extra visitors , generating up to Â£ 700m of extra income for the area , and creating up to 17,000 jobs for local people . "

the free concert on thursday , which also acts as a curtain raiser to the new football season in the us , will see the band playing in times square and giants ' stadium in new york .

singer jon bon jovi , who lives in the town of middleton , new jersey , said he saw the smoke rising from the world trade center from a local beach .
" when i was a kid , the army and marines would call , wanting me to enlist , " he told the new york daily news .
" i used to jokingly say , ' the day they invade asbury park , give me a call ' ... here i am 22 years later and i felt like they 'd arrived . "
meanwhile comedian jerry lewis , hosting his 37th national telethon over the weekend to benefit the muscular dystrophy association -lrb- mda -rrb- , paid tribute to the international association of fire fighters on the show .
" we do it tonight because it is absolutely necessary , " lewis told the audience in hollywood , in reference to the heavy loss of life at the world trade center .
the president of the firefighters union , harold schaitberger appeared with lewis to talk about the fund-raising efforts his group undertook on behalf of firefighters killed in the attacks .
" one of the very first calls i received that day from outside the fire service was jerry lewis , " said schaitberger , adding that the organisation was committed to making its largest ever pledge to the telethon .
singer partti labelle is among those to have performed on the 21-hour show .
lewis also launched a stinging attack on the perpetrators of the us attacks , branding them " filthy mideastern cowards " .

the bid may be a hostile one , according to a report in the financial times , as vivendi 's advisors have indicated the french firm is not interested in selling sfr .
vodafone is thought likely to offer about Â£ 8bn -lrb- $ 12.3bn -rrb- in cash for sfr .
analysts say vodafone is attracted to sfr because france remains the only major european market where it does not have a controlling stake in its mobile operations .
its prospects of winning control of sfr got a boost from another quarter on monday as british telecom confirmed it intends to offload its stake in the french mobile firm 's biggest shareholder .
hoping to pounce ?
debt-burdened vivendi is struggling to streamline itself by shedding non-core businesses .
recently-appointed chief executive jean-rene fourtou , who has pledged to solve vivendi 's woes , has negotiated fresh credit with it banks .
but he faces a deadline of the end of september to complete talks on additional funds .
in august , the french firm sold vodafone its share of their joint venture european internet portal vizzavi for 142.7m euros -lrb- Â£ 90.4m ; $ 140.5m -rrb- .
vodafone currently owns a 32 % stake in sfr - 20 % of it directly and 15 % through french telecoms firm cegetel .
it is believed to want to increase this by bidding for vivendi 's stake in cegetel , which controls sfr .
vivendi owns 44 % of cegetel , which in turns owns 80 % of sfr .
waiting game vodafone , which has refused to comment on the report , is thought likely to wait until the end of september to make an offer .
under existing arrangements , cegetel share holders are " locked in " to their stakes in the firm till 23 september 2002 .
after that date , the firm 's ownership can become more fluid .
cegetel 's other shareholders include british telecom , which wants to sell its 26 % shareholding .
" we 're looking to sell our stake in cegetel , " said a bt spokeswoman .
" that stake certainly does n't form a part of our core business , so we are looking to exit that , " vodafone has unused bank facilities of $ 10.65bn which it could use to pay for the purchase , the financial times reported .
however , investors gave the news of a possible vodafone shopping trip the thumbs down .
the giant mobile phone firm , which operates in 17 european countries , has a debt mountain of its own , built up during a spate of acquisitions .
vodafone 's shares fell more than 2 % to 101 pence in early trading in london .
other cegetel shareholders include us firm sbc communications , which owns 15 % of the french firm .

no doubt that 's why al qaeda chose it .
the events of september 11th sent shudders through global financial markets and raised the spectre of a global recession .
in the end , the economic consequences of those terrible events were n't as severe as many people feared .
but it was a very uneasy ride .
even before that morning , the economic context was clouded .
for the previous decade , the united states had been the dominant driving force of the international economy .
long boom the us boomed through the 1990s .
when there was a wave of financial crises in the developing world - asia , russia and brazil from 1997 to 1999 - the us steamed on , providing a market for the rest of the world , especially for the asian countries recovering from their crisis .

no doubt that 's why al qaeda chose it .
the events of september 11th sent shudders through global financial markets and raised the spectre of a global recession .
in the end , the economic consequences of those terrible events were n't as severe as many people feared .
but it was a very uneasy ride .
even before that morning , the economic context was clouded .

the public anemone is a robot set in a rock pool filled with greenish water which reacts to light and touch , much like an real sea anemone .
the researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology in boston see their robot as a way of exploring artificial life .
they hope to gain insights into how to create robots that can behave and interact naturally with humans .
sea life " robots do n't have to be hard and mechanical , they can be organic , move naturally and be supple , " said cynthia breazeal of the media lab at the massachusetts institute of technology in boston .
breazeal : robots do n't have to be metallic " the idea is inspired by a more primitive form of life , so it looks almost like a cross between a plant and an animal , " she told the bbc programme go digital .
the public anemone has a flexible spine-like body .
around it are fibre optic wires , supposed to represent nematode worms , that pull in if you touch them .
the robotic creature is set in an aquarium so that the researchers can watch how people interact with something that appears organic but is in reality mechanical .
alien world " it moves in a serpentine motion , a very graceful motion and is covered in a silicon skin so it has a soft texture to it , " said professor breazeal .
being a robot is thirsty work the robot is set in its own rock garden , with more than 100 elements such as the lighting and sound effects controlled by computer .
the set is supposed to represent an interactive alien world .
" every now and then the anemone breaks from its chores in order to look at you , find your face , orient towards it. and if you reach it and startle it , it withdraws . "
the public anemone was recently showcased at the world 's leading computer graphics conference , siggraph , in the us .

bush : economy is sound it was an unusual coupling given the top two us leaders for security reasons have kept their distance from one another since september 's attacks in new york and washington .
it is but one example of how vulnerable republicans feel given the wobbly state of the us economy .
no longer fearful of terrorists and their tactics , messrs bush and cheney feel far more threatened by the ballot box .
accounting debacles and an anaemic economic recovery threaten to remove republican lawmakers , long associated with corporate interests , from their offices after november 's elections .
it is a turnaround from the mood after 11 september , when rapid action by the government and the us central bank , the federal reserve , seemed to stop the recession in its tracks .
funny books mr bush continues to hammer away his message the economy is sound - if sluggish .
americans , already angered by a spate of accounting scandals , are clearly worried by the slow progress of the economic recovery after enduring many months of uncertainty .
following last september 's terrorist attacks , doomsayers predicted the us economy , already slowing down , would fall deeper into recession .
but it rebounded quickly , leaving analysts to remark on what was thought to be the mildest recession in recent memory .
one reason was the series of interest rate cuts by the fed , bringing rates down to 1.75 % by christmas , the lowest in forty years .
beginning with the new year , however , it became apparent the glut of corporate-accounting scandals could swamp the fledgling recovery .
cavalier executives through their funny bookkeeping accomplished what osama bin laden 's grand attack could not in dashing america 's confidence .
y2k boost nevertheless , the effects of the 11 september attacks still ripple through the us economy .
shrinking share prices have created a headache the most conspicuous are those that affect the travel industry , including airlines , aerospace manufacturers , and resorts and hotels .
the recent bankruptcy filing by us airways was blamed squarely on the attacks , as are united airlines ' current woes .
but there are also significant indirect effects , says john lonski , senior economist at moody 's investors service .
" there 's a lot of risk aversion that is restraining business-investment spending , -lsb- which -rsb- will perhaps persist until the matter with iraq is clarified , " he says .
corporate investment has been noticeably absent in the us , following massive outlays for new computers and software in advance of year 2000 -lrb- y2k -rrb- .
us government spending businesses have since reined in costs , including business travel , thereby contributing further to airlines ' woes .
consumers , however , have continued to spend - and so has the us government .
in fact , the biggest effect of the 11 september terror attacks has been on the us budget , says jim glassman , chief economist at jp morgan .
" it changed our attitudes about fiscal austerity and the use of the budget , " he says , adding the attacks opened the floodgates for government spending - much of it unrelated to terrorism .
the boost in government largesse has fanned fears that years of fiscal discipline have been abandoned and budget deficits will balloon .
optimistic predictions as uncle sam loosens his budget belt , mr bush 's much-touted tax scheme , which helped sweep him into office , has come under fire .
the bush administration has forecast a deficit this year of $ 165bn -lrb- Â£ 107bn -rrb- , $ 60bn greater than previously thought .
the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- has criticised the president 's economic policies , saying he should raise taxes to balance the budget .
" the economic slowdown , the june 2001 tax cuts , the additional outlays associated with the 11 september terrorist attacks , and the march 2002 stimulus package now mean that deficits are likely for the next few years , " the imf said in its annual review of the us economy .
mr greenspan is mindful of the weakening recovery the imf also called the mr bush 's prediction of return to budget surpluses by 2005 " optimistic " .
economic risks the imf assessment was not all doom and gloom .
it said the recovery remains on track despite steep drops in share prices over the last four months .
it revised upward its expected growth rate of the us economy to 2.5 % from its previous 2.3 % it expected in april .
nevertheless , the imf said even as the economy is on the mend , " downside risks have intensified " .
the federal reserve bank came to the same conclusion after its most recent meeting .
it said in its policy statement , " the -lsb- economic -rsb- risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness " and hinted that it might lower interest rates further .
ballot box even as the us economy continues to shake off the effects of the 11 september attacks , the president is haunted more by the spectre of scandal and economic mismanagement .
to address that concern , the bush team in recent weeks has begun pointing the finger at the previous administration for the recession .
revised data unveiled in july proves the downturn started during the final months of bill clinton 's term , the bush administration says .
more recently , senior officials have begun to blame the recent accounting scandals on mr clinton as well .
they insist slack policies under his watch led to the corporate malfeasance that has soured investors and threatened to derail the current economic recovery .
at his economic forum in waco , mr bush touted the meeting as a way for " ordinary americans " and " regular folks " have their concerns aired over the state of the economy .
november 's elections , however , will be the final test of whether americans believe the bush team is delivering on its predictions .

bbc news -pipe- in depth -pipe- september 11 one year on -pipe- uk economy ' not out of woods ' bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point monday , 2 september , 2002 , 09:20 gmt 10:20 uk uk economy ' not out of woods ' by evan davis bbc economics editor far be it from me to quote charles dickens , but as far as the uk economy has been concerned in the past year , one can only say they were the best of times , they were the worst of times .
the best of times because britain has enjoyed a consumer boom -lrb- so far household spending is 3.9 % higher than last year -rrb- , a surge in house prices , and the lowest unemployment of any of the big industrial nations .
and by a narrow margin the uk avoided a recession -lrb- although growth was only 0.1 % in the six months between october to march -rrb- .
that is a very long way from the kind of crisis people were talking about in the aftermath of the attacks on the twin towers .
there can be little doubt that the economic impact of the terrorist attacks on the uk economy was very modest - mostly affecting specific sectors like aviation , tourism and insurance .
overseas visits to the united kingdom fell by 9 % for 2001 , with a big drop after september 11 .
but for all the so-called good news , for all the " va va voom " in the uk economy 's performance over the past year , there is still a very strong air of gloom around .
bad times it has been the worst of times in the stock market , which is well down - by 21 % for the year to date .
it has been a truly awful year for company investment -lrb- down over 5 % on a year ago -rrb- .
the city is in the midst of a job-shedding frenzy , albeit a quiet one .
and so is manufacturing industry , hurt by weaker exports to us and european markets .
these good times and bad times of the past year have co-existed , but they have not done so by coincidence .
the two are inextricably linked .
boom to bust the financial market boom and the investment boom of the late nineties led to the inevitable bust which has been so apparent in the last year .
that bust promoted drastic cuts in interest rates , and this prompted the housing and consumer booms that have kept the economy going at a tolerable rate .
hence , what we have seen in the past year is loose monetary policy cause the baton to pass from an old boom that had expired , to a new one .
that has given us the simultaneous bad side and good side to the economic story .
both sides represent the aftermath not of september 11 , but of the us-led stock market boom .
obviously one lesson of this experience is that monetary policy can work - it was those interest rate cuts made within days of 11 september that caused the mini-boom .
indeed , it is fair to say that one of the most important economic effects of the terrorist attacks might have been that they provoked early central bank action to stimulate the big economies .
and paradoxically , it happened just at a time when the economies needed pre-emptive action for reasons quite unrelated to the attacks themselves .
future worries but this analysis tells us that we are not out of the woods yet .
the very fact that we have moved from one boom to another over the past year is an indication that things are not quite right yet .

we seem a long way from that right now .

bbc news online examines the risks associated with the drug .
what is ecstasy ?
ecstasy is an illegal drug .
it is manufactured and is usually taken in tablet form .
it is related to amphetamine or ' speed ' .
it has a mood-altering effect and can sometimes cause mild hallucinations .
the cost of the drug has dropped sharply in recent years .
tablets can now be purchased for as little as Â£ 3 each in some parts of britain .
the drug is commonly used by young people attending raves or nightclubs .
an estimated 500,000 young britons take ecstasy every weekend .
surveys suggest that 15 % of 16 to 24 year olds have tried the drug while only 1 % of those over 35 have tried it .
what are the risks associated with taking the drug ?
most doctors and scientists believe that ecstasy is harmful .
recent studies have suggested that regular use of the drug may cause long-term brain changes , including memory impairment and depression .
others say it kills brain cells that produce serotonin , a vital chemical which regulates mood .
little is known about the long-term effects of regular usage of the drug , but some doctors believe it could damage the brain and vital organs like the liver and kidneys .
ecstasy is not regarded as being physically addictive .
however , users can become hooked on the psychological effects of the drug .
ecstasy has been linked to a number of deaths .
between 1993 and 1997 , there were 72 deaths in the uk attributed to ecstasy .
this compares to 158 deaths during that time which were linked to ' speed ' .
what does this latest study say ?
writing in the magazine , the psychologist , scientists at the university of liverpool suggest that previous research into the drug has been flawed .
they suggest that some experts have been biased and have interpreted their results to fit their view that the drug is unsafe .
they have stated that the drug may not be as dangerous in the long-term as some scientists suggest .
they also believe that the reported adverse effects of ecstasy may be imaginary - simply because most people now believe that the drug is harmful .
the scientists have also questioned the drug 's effects on the brain .
they believe ecstasy only affects nerve fibres , which can be regrown , and not cells .
their research paper has been criticised by scientists in the field and the parents of young people who have died after taking the drug .
what is the government 's view on the drug ?
mps have called for ecstasy to be downgraded from a class a drug to class b. the commons home affairs committee said the government was wrong to suggest that ecstasy was as harmful as heroin .
the reclassification would reduce the maximum sentence for those found carrying ecstasy from seven years to five .
those supplying or making the drug would be jailed for 14 years at most rather than facing the current possible life prison term .
home secretary david blunkett has rejected the call .
he has stated firmly that reclassification of ecstasy is not on his or the government 's agenda .

the best of times because britain has enjoyed a consumer boom -lrb- so far household spending is 3.9 % higher than last year -rrb- , a surge in house prices , and the lowest unemployment of any of the big industrial nations .
and by a narrow margin the uk avoided a recession -lrb- although growth was only 0.1 % in the six months between october to march -rrb- .
the housing boom continued unabated that is a very long way from the kind of crisis people were talking about in the aftermath of the attacks on the twin towers .
there can be little doubt that the economic impact of the terrorist attacks on the uk economy was very modest - mostly affecting specific sectors like aviation , tourism and insurance .
overseas visits to the united kingdom fell by 9 % for 2001 , with a big drop after september 11 .
but for all the so-called good news , for all the " va va voom " in the uk economy 's performance over the past year , there is still a very strong air of gloom around .
bad times it has been the worst of times in the stock market , which is well down - by 21 % for the year to date .
it has been a truly awful year for company investment -lrb- down over 5 % on a year ago -rrb- .
the city is in the midst of a job-shedding frenzy , albeit a quiet one .
and so is manufacturing industry , hurt by weaker exports to us and european markets .
these good times and bad times of the past year have co-existed , but they have not done so by coincidence .
the two are inextricably linked .
boom to bust the financial market boom and the investment boom of the late nineties led to the inevitable bust which has been so apparent in the last year .
that bust promoted drastic cuts in interest rates , and this prompted the housing and consumer booms that have kept the economy going at a tolerable rate .
hence , what we have seen in the past year is loose monetary policy cause the baton to pass from an old boom that had expired , to a new one .
that has given us the simultaneous bad side and good side to the economic story .
both sides represent the aftermath not of september 11 , but of the us-led stock market boom .
obviously one lesson of this experience is that monetary policy can work - it was those interest rate cuts made within days of 11 september that caused the mini-boom .
indeed , it is fair to say that one of the most important economic effects of the terrorist attacks might have been that they provoked early central bank action to stimulate the big economies .
and paradoxically , it happened just at a time when the economies needed pre-emptive action for reasons quite unrelated to the attacks themselves .
future worries but this analysis tells us that we are not out of the woods yet .
the very fact that we have moved from one boom to another over the past year is an indication that things are not quite right yet .
only when house prices that are too high and savings that are too low come back into line with their long term averages , will we know that the hangover of the nineties has passed .
we seem a long way from that right now .

veerappan abducted h nagappa , a former minister from the neighbouring karnataka state , and demanded the release of prisoners held in both tamil nadu and karnataka in exchange for mr nagappa 's freedom .
but tamil nadu chief minister jayalalitha told journalists in madras on monday her government would " do everything necessary " to capture veerappan , a notorious elephant poacher and sandal-wood smuggler , wanted for the alleged murder of around 100 men .
the state government in karnataka , in contrast , says it plans to negotiate mr nagappa 's safe release and is known to have eased off a search operation by security forces in the forest straddling the borders between the two states where veerappan operates .
family concerns despite her tough approach , ms jayalalitha assured the nagappa family that her government would try to capture the bandit without threatening mr nagappa 's life .
similar assurances were given by the chief minister of karnataka , sm krishna , to mr nagappa 's wife and son , at the family 's home in champarajnagar on the karnataka-tamil nadu border last week .
correspondents say mr nagappa 's family members are anxious to secure his release unharmed and the karnataka state government appears to have been more sympathetic to their pleas .
however , ms jayalalitha too appears to be paying attention to the concerns expressed by the nagappa family , and would be meeting mrs nagappa on tuesday .
but she seems determined to pursue the brigand .
she told journalists that while she was sympathetic to the family , she was opposed to sending emissaries to negotiate a deal with veerappan .
peaceful efforts karnataka officials , on the other hand , have already consulted venugopal , a lawyer , who has in the past served as an intermediary .
" the government of karnataka called on me and we spoke , " he said , " i 'm awaiting a message from veerappan . "
" we are expecting some demands from him though there are none to date , " mr venugopal told the afp news agency .
the indian government in delhi , concerned about the lack of progress in the search for mr nagappa , has offered troops but neither karnataka nor tamil nadu has showed any interest .
deputy prime minister lk advani is attending a function in karnataka on monday and is discussing the situation with state officials .
correspondents say a fresh initiative could emerge from the discussions .

in the aftermath of 11 september , europe had the chance to become the world 's economic superpower - and blew it royally .
europe has suffered no crippling terrorist attack , borne only a fraction of the burden of military response , endured no hi-tech meltdown -lrb- largely because it had no hi-tech sector in the first place -rrb- and remained immune to this year 's wave of accounting scandals .
but its economy , dangerously sluggish before the us attacks , has only become more so .
growth has stalled , stock markets have lagged wall street , the euro 's rebound has lost momentum - and political and economic relations with the us have rarely been worse .
nothing changed defying the well-worn maxim that " after 11 september , everything changed , " europe 's economy looks pretty familiar .
during the late 1990s , as the us surfed on a wave of hi-tech optimism , europe was derided for its rust-belt industries and grudging attitude to economic reform .
half a decade later , europe 's lack of sizzling internet start-ups may seem less embarrassing , but its economy is scarcely any more fashionable .
economic growth in the eurozone , which flickered into some sort of life a year ago , has now subsided below 0.5 % .
unemployment , europe 's economic achilles ' heel , has crept ever higher , and in germany refuses to stay below a hefty 4 million .
without the excuse of internet collapses , 11 september or enron , the continent 's stock markets have underperformed even the dow .
and the euro , although successfully launching as a cash currency at the beginning of this year and rallying bravely thereafter , has remained consistently below its launch rate .
feeling america 's pain the question is whether things could have been any different .
to a certain extent , europe has been the victim of circumstances .
although many like to think that europe gains when the us loses , america 's travails in the past year have spelt bad news for the eurozone economy .
as american companies pulled in their horns , investment in their preferred foreign market - europe - shrivelled away .
consumers , an increasingly powerful motor of the european economy , have proved just as skittish on this side of the atlantic as in the us .
and the fact that the terror attacks were directed at the us did not make europe immune from the financial paralysis of the post-attack months .
bad behaviour but europe has done itself few favours .
interest rates , which have been halved in the us since 11 september , have been cut by less than one-quarter by a grudging european central bank .
and with elections across much of europe in 2002 , notably in germany and france , politicians have been reluctant to push through the slash-and-burn reforms needed to make the economy nimbler .
most damaging of all - and to be fair , not something brussels can entirely be blamed for - has been the alarming deterioration in relations with washington .
although tolerably staunch allies on the battlefield , europe and us seem to be taking out their frustrations in the boardroom .
tit for tat just before 11 september , europe 's increasingly pugnacious competition authorities vetoed a merger between two us firms , honeywell and general electric .
since then , a number of skirmishes have been fought in the trade arena , culminating in president george w bush 's decision in march to slap punitive tariffs on steel imports .
at the same time , mr bush signed into law the biggest package of farm subsidies in us history , an act that brussels condemns as naked protectionism .
behind both sides ' positions lies a pile of ideological baggage : the us sees europeans as hypocritical whiners ; europeans are increasingly vocal about american cultural imperialism .
time for a change so what are the prospects for europe ?
economies are continuing to slow : the latest data out of germany , by far the region 's biggest , shows troubling signs of a " double-dip " recession , dipping back into the slump it escaped from earlier this year .
and as an assault on iraq becomes more likely , the ideological gulf between europe and the us will only widen .
one factor might shake-up the status quo , however .
the french election saw a shift to a right-of-centre regime ; according to the latest opinion polls , germany 's - due in late september - may do the same .
the new french government is still feeling its way , and the hopeful german opposition is being careful as the election approaches , but both promise a substantial change of direction .
of course neither may end up doing much to stimulate the european economy .
but a change - of almost any kind - is just what europe needs .

consumers , an increasingly powerful motor of the european economy , have proved just as skittish on this side of the atlantic as in the us .
and the fact that the terror attacks were directed at the us did not make europe immune from the financial paralysis of the post-attack months .
bad behaviour but europe has done itself few favours .
interest rates , which have been halved in the us since 11 september , have been cut by less than one-quarter by a grudging european central bank .
and with elections across much of europe in 2002 , notably in germany and france , politicians have been reluctant to push through the slash-and-burn reforms needed to make the economy nimbler .
most damaging of all - and to be fair , not something brussels can entirely be blamed for - has been the alarming deterioration in relations with washington .
although tolerably staunch allies on the battlefield , europe and us seem to be taking out their frustrations in the boardroom .
tit for tat just before 11 september , europe 's increasingly pugnacious competition authorities vetoed a merger between two us firms , honeywell and general electric .
the rusty cause of much transatlantic anguish since then , a number of skirmishes have been fought in the trade arena , culminating in president george w bush 's decision in march to slap punitive tariffs on steel imports .
at the same time , mr bush signed into law the biggest package of farm subsidies in us history , an act that brussels condemns as naked protectionism .
behind both sides ' positions lies a pile of ideological baggage : the us sees europeans as hypocritical whiners ; europeans are increasingly vocal about american cultural imperialism .
time for a change so what are the prospects for europe ?
economies are continuing to slow : the latest data out of germany , by far the region 's biggest , shows troubling signs of a " double-dip " recession , dipping back into the slump it escaped from earlier this year .
do n't talk about reform - it 's election year and as an assault on iraq becomes more likely , the ideological gulf between europe and the us will only widen .
one factor might shake-up the status quo , however .
the french election saw a shift to a right-of-centre regime ; according to the latest opinion polls , germany 's - due in late september - may do the same .
the new french government is still feeling its way , and the hopeful german opposition is being careful as the election approaches , but both promise a substantial change of direction .
of course neither may end up doing much to stimulate the european economy .
but a change - of almost any kind - is just what europe needs .

russia 's president vladimir putin has proved that he knew how to do it .
the events of 11 september have given him a unique chance to portray russia as reliable partner of the west - and gain economic support as a result .
in a striking contrast to his predecessor , the old spymaster evgeniy primakov , who had cancelled his trip to washington at midair on hearing the news that nato was bombing yugoslavia , mr. putin decided to join the joining the us-led war against terror .
thinking the unthinkable the president then over-ruled his old school generals and diplomats and allowed the us to establish military bases in the central asian republics , normally regarded by moscow as its rear garden .
he even promised to give the americans all russian intelligence information related to afghanistan .
the energy dialogue resulted in the first ever direct shipment of russian oil to the us as part of his honeymoon with washington , mr. putin also signed the first arms-control treaty in a decade and abandoned his opposition to the us renunciation of the anti-ballistic missile treaty .
in the past year , russia 's opposition to nato and eu enlargement has also all but vanished .
although opposed by the foreign policy establishment , the new business elite with strong global ambitions has vocally supported these moves .
hefty rewards they say that mr. putin simply accepted the inevitable , and in return russia will get much needed economic benefits .
during the past year russia was formally admitted to the g7 club of the wealthiest nations , with the prospect of a world summit in moscow .
the country has been given -lrb- by both the us and eu -rrb- the status of a market economy , enabling russia 's companies to export to west without being subject of painful anti-dumping tariffs .
and the strategic goal to gaining full membership of the world trade organisation is now much closer .
oil companies are also expecting huge benefits from the recently signed energy cooperation protocol with the us .
much needed support russia hopes to join wto and not to limit its export to energy only washington has even promised to encourage americans to invest in russia 's stock market , still soaring but threatened as the influx of reinvestments from offshore banks on cyprus and channel islands slows down .
although russia 's economy , boosted by high oil prices and political stability , has been booming for the past three years , a huge debt repayment problem is looming .
in 2003 the country has to pay some $ 17bn to its western creditors .
in the new spirit of political cooperation and amity with the west , new credits or even debt restructuring is no longer unthinkable .
top priority they were friends once russia still suffers from enormous and ineffective bureaucracy .
its energy and banking sectors need to be reformed , and social and pension programmes will need radical changes as population shrinks .
crumbling infrastructure , increasing health problems and striking inequality make the picture more sombre .
but there are dangers in the western approach .
by giving russia politically motivated economic benefits , like granting a market economy status before all the necessary reforms were even started , or hinting that the wto rules might be bent to make russia 's admittance faster , the us might weaken its leverage to enforce change should moscow 's zeal for modernisation evaporate .
for now the president and the majority of his voters are happy to get any kind of politically motivated economic credit they can muster .
mr. putin has said that the prosperity of the russians as his top priority , and few regret his giving away some musty imperial ambitions if it makes them better off .
although opinion polls suggest almost three quarters of the russians distrust america , those who can afford it buy imported goods , spend holidays in europe and desire the country to be more " civilised " , freer and prosperous .
mr. mr putin 's alliance with the us after 11 september looks both profitable and stable .
but one should not forget that in the past 15 years anti-western sentiments in russia have increased each time the economy faltered .
this happened in the early 1990s when mikhail gorbachev and then boris yeltsin 's reforms failed to deliver instant prosperity , and again in 1998 when a devastating financial crisis wiped out the first fruits of the painful market transition .
neither a powerful president nor the rich west can guarantee that russia will continue to prosper .

the appletons are not about to trade in their history with a great girl band , but their debut offering as a duo is just different enough to create a stir .

the continuing weakness of the japanese economy cast a long shadow across the region .
american industry was already contracting , with only consumers keeping the economy from sliding into recession .
singapore is built on trade , and reliant on high tech exports , particularly to the us .
the country actually slipped into recession in the first half of 2001 , well before the attacks in september .
immediately after 11 september people feared there would be a serious economic impact in asia .
tourism hit the most obvious impact was on travel .
people simply stopped flying .
that threatened to cripple the region 's tourism industry , which by now is vital for its economy .
in the past 20 years , thailand 's tourist industry has doubled in size , and is now the country 's biggest foreign currency earner .
as cambodia slowly emerges from decades of conflict , the trickle of adventurous travellers drawn to the splendours of angkor wat has grown to a steady stream .
in 1999 400,000 tourists arrived , earning the country $ 200m - more than 6 % of gdp .
over the past few years malaysia has watched the number of visitors grow steadily , and it 's become an increasingly important part of the economy .
by 2001 tourism accounted for 7.8 % of malaysia 's gdp .
the drop in visitor numbers was rapid , and dramatic .
between october and december last year , 2.3 million people visited malaysia - a drop of 17.9 % .
the same thing happened across the region - and only now are tourist numbers beginning to recover .
export worries asia 's exporters , particularly those making hi-tech goods , also feared hard times when the american economy slipped into recession .
exporters prepared for the worst , but american consumers showed more defiance than fear , and demand held up better than many had expected .
but some countries continued to struggle .
indonesia was already struggling under a mountain of debt , political instability and allegations of corruption - it was hardly in a strong position to win foreign direct investment .
it did n't seem likely its position as the world 's most populous muslim nation would help matters in the wake of september 11th .
and indeed foreign direct investment has fallen - but is politics the cause ?
china : threat or promise ?
china is winning an ever greater share of the foreign investment heading to asia , as investors are won over by the appeal of its staggering rates of economic growth .
and since it joined the wto in december , china 's markets are beginning to open up , offering greater access to its hundreds of millions of consumers .
china 's rapid growth and low cost of production is often seen as a threat to south east asian economies .
however china is n't only a market for western investors .
south east asia is seeing considerable growth in exports to china .
malaysia alone has seen exports to china grow by 50 % .
to some extent , this has helped pick up the slack from a slower us economy .
us influence but the us remains a dominant factor in the region 's economic health , especially for malaysia and singapore , and we 're not out of the woods yet .
early in the year it was becoming clear that the economic impact had n't been as bad as people expected .
there were tentative signs of real recovery .
singapore 's recession was officially over - it reported positive growth for the final quarter of 2002 .
then corporate scandals in the us sent stock prices tumbling and the us economy teetering back towards recession .
millions of americans saw their savings and investments wiped out .
that has caused much more serious damage to american buying power , and so economists here are warning the current downturn may prove to be a greater problem for asia 's economic recovery .
