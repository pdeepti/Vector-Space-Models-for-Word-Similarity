the situation is very difficult alfredo atanasof cabinet chief for some goods , the price rises have been even greater .
the prices of fresh eggs and vegetable oils , as well as the prices of computers and televisions , have risen between 100 % and 200 % , according to a survey by the argentine business chamber came .
the sharpest price increases were seen in april , raising fears that there could be worse to come .
" on monday the official inflation rate -lsb- for april -rsb- will be announced , and it will be around 10 % -lsb- for that month alone -rsb- , " said cabinet chief alfredo atanasof in interviews on sunday .
suffering a 70 % fall in the value of the peso since the 11-year peg to the us dollar was ended in january has sent the prices of imported goods soaring .
many argentines can not afford to buy food this has boosted demand for home-grown products , sending these prices higher too .
had it not been for a price freeze on public utilities , the official inflation rate would have been even higher .
after four years of recession , the country suffers from almost 20 % unemployment and flat wages , so the argentine people can ill afford a return to hyper-inflation - as seen during the 1980s when inflation reached almost 5,000 % .
" the situation is very difficult , " said mr atanasof .
surprise prices have risen much more sharply than president eduardo duhalde had predicted .
in january , he predicted that inflation for the year as a whole would reach 15 % .
despite having been caught by surprise , the argentine government will not intervene , mr atanasof said .
last week , argentina 's new economy minister , roberto lavagna , vowed to keep the peso floating .

total wine exports rose 33.3 % in march from february to 182m australian dollars -lrb- £ 67m ; $ 98m -rrb- , the australian bureau of statistics said .

the north americans imported almost 11 million litres of australian wine in march , up from about 7 million litres in february .
european drinkers sales to europe rose sharply too , climbing to 22.4 million litres from 16.9 million in february .
during 2001 , australia exported a total of 338.3 million litres of wine , generating a $ 1.75bn in foreign earnings .
wine is one of australia 's fastest-growing export products .

domestic demand weak australian wine makers saw their home sales fall in march , with domestic consumption slipping 4.9 % to 32.4 million litres .
however , the decline did not reflect increased consumption of foreign wines .

moreover , the policy framework put in place by labour - including an independent bank of england and new rules on government spending - have been widely praised , and have now been broadly accepted by the opposition .
labour has also stabilised the public finances , having inherited a huge budget deficit .
now the chancellor faces a new challenge of raising the money needed for the modernisation of the nhs and other key public services .
and a decision over the uk 's membership of the euro is promised by the middle of next year .
despite reforms , british companies are still lagging behind their european and us counterparts in the battle for higher productivity .
the improvement in the uk 's economic performance - which began under the conservatives - has given labour a once unthought of reputation as the party of economic competence , and helped make gordon brown the most popular minister after the prime minister .
however , as the graphs in this article demonstrate , the uk 's economic improvement began while kenneth clarke was still chancellor .
bank independence gordon brown 's first act on becoming chancellor was probably his most significant .
within days of taking power , he gave the bank of england independence to set interest rates through a nine-person monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- .
the mpc has generally won praise from economists for its rapid response to changing economic conditions , and cuts in interest rates helped moderate the consequences for britain of the world financial crisis in 1998 and the severe recession in the us in 2001 .
in fact , in 2001 , the uk was the fastest-growing of any of the world 's major economies , while inflation remained subdued and unemployment continued to fall .
shadow chancellor michael howard backs the creation of an independent mpc , saying " we have a framework now which i say is working pretty well .. in monetary policy at least , there is now a very considerable degree of economic consensus . "
gordon brown still retains a strong degree of influence on the mpc , appointing half its members for relatively short three-year terms .
and the chancellor also sets the inflation target - currently 2.5 % - which is " symmetrical " .
that means the bank is obliged to lower interest rates if inflation is too low as well as raise them if it is high , helping to keep growth strong .
however , as the fifth annoversary arrived , many economists believe that the chancellor is being optimistic in his estimates of future growth , and he has revised the long-run growth estimate for the uk economy by 0.25 % to 2.5 % .
prudence with a purpose ?
the move will help the government bridge the financing gap between spending and tax collections now that the chancellor has decided to loosen the purse-strings .
in his first three years in office , gordon brown enforced a severe squeeze on public spending - sticking with the conservatives ' spending plans - and in doing so during economic boom times , he eliminated the budget deficit .
but the cost was a further deterioration in public services , which the chancellor wants to put right with a £ 40bn increase in health spending over the next 5 years .
mr brown has announced an £ 8bn tax increase for next year - adding 1 % to national insurance payments to both employers and employees to fund the rise .
nevertheless , the budget deficit is set to rise to 1.4 % of gdp , or £ 17bn , by 2005-06 - although under the chancellor 's rules spending for investment , around £ 10bn , can be disregarded .
however , labour has consistently underspent public money earmarked for investment , and could be vulnerable if tax increases do not result in measurable improvements in public services .
euro debate the rising budget deficit is one of the main reasons the chancellor appears to have grown more eurosceptic .
if the uk adopted the euro , then britain would have to aim to balance its budget and ensure that it never borrowed more than 3 % of gdp .
the european commission has already criticised the uk government for its rising deficit .
mr brown has pledged to tell parliament by the middle of next year whether the uk meets the five tests he has set for recommending euro-membership to the public - who would then have the chance to vote in a referendum .
many economists believe that the uk already meets the main test - that its economy is broadly convergent with the rest of the eu , with interest rates , inflation and growth broadly similar .
but mr brown appears reluctant to hand over the main job of economic management to the european central bank , after the success of the independent bank of england .
given the chancellor 's tight grip on economic policy , this could be the biggest source of tension with the prime minister , who is notably warmer towards the single currency .
strains with business the big tax increase has taken its toll on labour 's relations with business , which both mr blair and mr brown had been carefully cultivating .
corporate leaders have been upset over the lack of consultation over the tax increases , and they complain that under labour the burden of regulation has risen - partly because labour has adopted some european social legislation .
with labour still riding high in the opinion polls , big business is not about to abandon its dialogue with the government - and the chancellor will continue with his raft of measures to boost training , research , and investment .
however , in the long run , the biggest challenge for industry is to boost its productivity - the output that each worker produces - where the uk lags behind the us , germany , and france in order to raise the uk 's standard of living .
for mr brown , the challenge will be to keep his business supporters happy and his reputation for prudence intact , while presiding over the biggest increase in public spending for decades .

but in 2002 , as the premier celebrates his fifth anniversary in office , the average shopper can get one much more powerful for about half that much . "
the typical price of an home in 1997 was £ 68,000 compared to £ 102,000 now " the figures , compiled for bbc one 's vote 2002 programme , also found that most britons under mr blair 's stewardship are better off than they were .
when labour came in , £ 367 was the average weekly pay .
it is now up to £ 444 .
so what other things have changed for us in five years of tony blair ?
house prices up well there are more of us for a start - about 60m in 2002 , compared with 59m in 1997 .
there are still more women than men despite female numbers going up by about a quarter of a million , while males have grown by nearly half a million .
average earnings today can buy 21 more hamburgers than they could five years ago and 162 litres more petrol .
house prices have soared .
the typical price of an abode in 1997 was £ 68,000 compared to £ 102,000 now .
the working week has reduced by an hour to 38 hours and more of us travel abroad .
when labour came to power , half of us spent our holidays overseas and 11 % of us had mobile phones .
now 60 % of us travel abroad and nearly three quarters of us have mobile phones .
but despite this freedom , more of us are likely to be in jail .
inmates numbered 68,000 when mr blair took over .
now there are 77,000 .
private healthcare labour 's attack on crime is having mixed results - 274,000 violent crimes in 1997 and 438,000 cars stolen .
now there are 642,000 violent crimes a year , but car thefts are down to 373,000 .
meanwhile , it seems we are not turning into television addicts .
despite there being 366 tv channels now , compared to 40 in 1997 , we still watch an average of 25 hours television a week .
five years ago 9 % of households were connected to the internet , now 42 % are online .
but while 100,000 of us paid for our operations in 1997 , now 250,000 pay for treatment .
there is no change in the percentage of people going to independent private schools - 6.9 % in 1997 and the same figure now .
but enthusiasm for democracy is patchy - 30 % of the whole electorate voted for tony blair in 1997 .
in last year 's general election , less than a quarter of all those who could have voted cast their vote for labour .

some pledges have been omitted for the sake of brevity .
no judgement has been made to the inherent value of the pledge , but important criticisms are included where applicable .
you can choose another policy area below : introducton and explanation economy health education home affairs environment welfare constitution foreign / defence what the manifesto said : " as an initial , self-contained reform , not dependent on further reform in the future , the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the house of lords will be ended ... "
conclusion : pledge met the house of lords act 1999 disqualified all hereditary peers for membership of the house , but allowed 90 hereditary peers and the holders of the offices of earl marshal and lord great chamberlain to say on to ensure there were enough peers to conduct business .
the remaining hereditary peers will be excluded when the much postponed ' second stage ' of lords reform takes place .
what the manifesto said : " the appointment of life peers to the house of lords will be reviewed .
our objective will be to ensure that , over time , party appointees as life peers more accurately reflect the proportion of votes cast at the previous general election .
we are committed to maintaining an independent cross-bench presence of life peers . "
conclusion : partially met the government has yet to publish its proposals for completing stage two of lords reform .
a white paper last year came in for criticism and it is expected that legislation will differ from the proposals it made .
while this issue has frustrated the constitutional reform lobby , the government has established a commission to propose non-party peers - though its decisions have been criticised .
what the manifesto said : " a committee of both houses of parliament will be appointed to undertake a wide-ranging review of possible further change -lsb- in the lords -rsb- and then to bring forward proposals for reform . "
conclusion : pledge met a royal commission , chaired by lord wakeham and including members of both houses , recommended a mix of elected and appointed members .
however , the proposals put forward by the government has been criticised for not bearing any resemblance to the wakeham findings .
what the manifesto said : " we believe the house of commons is in need of modernisation and we will ask the house to establish a special select committee to review its procedures . "
conclusion : pledge met the modernisation committee first met in june 1997 and made a series of recommendations that led to some changes such as changing the hours of sittings .
criticisms and qualifications for many , however , it has not gone far enough .
a group of labour mps has led a campaigin to make westminster more family-friendly , including a protracted row over whether female mps can breastfeed in the commons chamber , a campaign they lost .
conservatives have also accused the government of using measures such as shorter hours to kill debate and push through legislation .
what the manifesto said : " prime minister 's questions will be made more effective . "
conclusion : debatable the only change that has been made to prime minister 's questions is to change it from two 15 minute sessions per week to one 30-minute session on wednesdays .
the government says that the longer session leads to a more informed and fairer debate .
the opposition says that there are fewer opportunities to put scrutinise the prime minister .
many outside observers think it 's still the same outdated occasion where the parties sling mud at each other .
what the manifesto said : " ministerial accountability will be reviewed so as to remove recent abuses . "
conclusion : pledge not met critics say that this was an extremely vague commitment .
the best public guide to its completion is the reissued ministerial code .
this document was criticised by the public administration committee for not properly clarifying issues of accountability .
what the manifesto said : " the process for scrutinising european legislation will be overhauled . "
conclusion : partially met the commons agreed in 1998 to widen the scope of european legislation which may be considered by the commons to include documents brought forward under all three pillars of the european union , rather than that brought forward purely through the european commission .
the select committee on european legislation has become the european scrutiny committee and three european standing committees were established .
however , the government also built into this resolution the right to override or expedite scrutiny of legislation in certain circumstances .
what the manifesto said : " the nolan recommendations will be fully implemented and extended to all public bodies . "
conclusion : pledge not met although the government has reiterated its intention to legislate in this area , no formal steps have actually been taken .
a 2001 report by the public administration select committee found that there were ongoing accountability issues with non-departmental bodies .
what the manifesto said : " we will oblige parties to declare the source of all donations above a minimum figure ... "
conclusion : pledge met parties must now declare donations of more than £ 5,000 to their central offices , as well as declaring donations over £ 1,000 to local or constituency parties .
this has not stopped labour 's opponents from pursuing allegations of under-the-counter sleaze against the party as both the bernie ecclestone and lakshmi mittal controversies have shown .
what the manifesto said : " foreign funding -lsb- of political parties -rsb- will be banned . "
conclusion : partially met there are some restrictions under european community law limiting the extent of restriction .
companies registered in another member state but carrying out some business in the uk can still make donations to uk parties .
candidates in northern ireland are exempt from all restrictions .
what the manifesto said : " we are committed to a referendum on the voting system for the house of commons .
an independent commission on voting systems will be appointed early to recommend a proportional alternative to the first-past-the-post system . "
conclusion : pledge not met the jenkins commission produced its report on a new voting system in october 1998 .
the government has not held a referendum on the subject .
what the manifesto said : " we are pledged to a freedom of information act , leading to more open government . "
conclusion : pledge met the freedom of information act received royal assent on 30 november 2000 .
criticisms and qualifications the act will not come into force until 2005 and it has been widely criticised as being as weak .
ministers will still have widespread exemptions from its provisions and some argue that it is actually weaker than the voluntary code introduced by the former conservative prime minister john major .
what the manifesto said : " a sovereign westminster parliament will devolve power to scotland ... and wales . "
conclusion : pledge met the scotland act gained royal assent on 19 november 1998 .
the scottish parliament met for the first time on 12 may 1999 .
the government of wales act was passed in 1998 and the new assembly took up powers in july 1999 .
what the manifesto said : " following a referendum to confirm popular demand , there will be a new deal for london , with a strategic authority and a mayor , each directly elected . "
conclusion : pledge met the directly-elected greater london authority was created in 2000 , under the greater london authority act 1999 .
ken livingstone was elected the first mayor of the city .
what the manifesto said : " demand for directly elected regional government so varies across england that it would be wrong to impose a uniform system .
in time we will introduce legislation to allow the people , region by region , to decide in a referendum whether they want directly elected regional government . "
conclusion : pledge not met while this pledge has not been met within the first five years , the government is expected to shortly propose what it will do .
regional assemblies for england has been hotly debated behind the scenes in whitehall and at westminster .
what the manifesto said : " we will encourage democratic innovations in local government , including pilots of the idea of elected mayors with executive powers in cities . "
conclusion : pledge met the local government act 2000 placed an obligation on councils to take a new structure , either a cabinet style system or a directly elected mayor .
the old committee system has been ditched .
what the manifesto said : " labour is committed to a fair distribution of government grant . "
conclusion : pledge not met labour described this as an ' urgent priority ' for reform .
but it has continued to use the existing grant formulae with no plans to change it before 2003 .
ministers say that a new " fairer and more stable " system will be introduced on 1 april 2003 but there is little detail about how it will work .
what the manifesto said : " councils should not be forced to put their services out to tender , but will be required to obtain best value . "
conclusion : pledge met the local government act 1999 abolished compulsory competitive tendering and introduced " best value " .
councils now have a duty to subject decisions to " the four cs " : competition , challenge , comparison and consultation .
what the manifesto said : " to ensure greater accountability , a proportion of councillors in each locality will be elected annually . "
conclusion : pledge not met metropolitan districts have elections of a third of council seats each year for three out of four years , a system district councils and english shire unitaries can choose to adopt .
however , they can also elect to keep the existing system of elections once every four years .
this four-year system remains in place for all other council structures -lrb- london boroughs , the gla , welsh and scottish unitaries and as well as a number of district and unitary authorities -rrb- .

you can choose another policy area below : introducton and explanation economy health education home affairs environment welfare constitution foreign / defence what the manifesto said : " urgent reform of the common agricultural policy .
it is costly , vulnerable to fraud and not geared to environmental protection . "
conclusion : pledge met in the last round of cap negotiations in 1999 , the way was paved for reform to the eu-wide system of agricultural subsidy .
agenda 2000 -lrb- as the reforms are known -rrb- makes provision for a gradual shift of subsidies from food production to rural development .
members states are now entitled to redirect up to 20 % of their eu money towards rural development schemes .

furthermore , the aftermath of the foot and mouth crisis has again highlighted the campaign for wider agricultural reforms .
what the manifesto said : " we will seek a thorough overhaul of the common fisheries policy to conserve our fish stocks in the long-term interests of the uk fishing industry . "
conclusion : partially met uk ministers take part in annual negotiations with other eu fisheries ministers to set fishing quotas .
in the most recent such meeting , the uk delegation managed to argue successfully for some of the quotas to be greater than those suggested by the commission .
criticisms and qualifications there is , however , some concern that the eu common fisheries policy is unworkable in its current form and radical reform is needed .
the commission have published proposals which have received broad support .
what the manifesto said : " greater openness and democracy in eu institutions with open voting in the council of ministers and more effective scrutiny of the commission by the european parliament . "
conclusion : pledge not met this issue has only recently been addressed within the european union with a deal to form a convention to examine the gap between brussels and the people .
the convention has a year to come up with proposals that will probably be put to the governments in 2004 .
what the manifesto said : " we have long supported a proportional voting system for election to the european parliament . "
conclusion : pledge met voting arrangements were changed in the european parliamentary elections act passed in january 1999 .
critics have attacked the " closed-list " form of proportional representation .
the further down a party list a candidate appears , the less likely they are to be elected for that party .
what the manifesto said : " retention of the national veto over key matters of national interest -lsb- in europe -rsb- . "
conclusion : debatable during the nice summit in 2000 , britain made it clear that it would not abandon the veto on six key areas : taxation , social security , border controls , defence , treaty changes and the uk 's own resources .
however , in a joint letter signed in february 2002 , tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schroeder called for a further reduction of the national veto in european union policymaking .
in a speech in the hague in february 2002 , foreign secretary jack straw suggested britain might accept an end to the use of the national veto in asylum and immigration policy .
what the manifesto said : " there are three pre-conditions which would have to be satisfied before britain could join -lsb- the euro -rsb- during the next parliament : first , the cabinet would have to agree ; then parliament ; and finally the people would have to say ' yes ' in a referendum . "
conclusion : pledge met in effect the government has kept to this pledge by not actually doing anything at all .
no decision on emu entry has been taken as yet .
by june 2003 , however , the treasury must decide whether there is a " clear and unambiguous " economic case for entry on the basis of its five tests .
the government must then win a referendum and apply for eurozone membership .
its european partners will have to agree that the uk meets the maastricht criteria .

conclusion : pledge met the strategic defence review was published in july 1998 .
the government has also begun further consultations to take account of international developments since 11 september 2001 .

the most critical question has been the issue of over-stretch .
conservatives have warned that the british armed forces have been under pressure because of commitments that have ranged from sierra leone to the balkans .
what the manifesto said : " labour will ban the import , export , transfer and manufacture of all forms of anti-personnel landmines .
we will introduce an immediate moratorium on their use . "

britain signed up immediately , and the landmines bill received royal assent on 28th july 1998 .
what the manifesto said : " labour will not permit the sale of arms to regimes that might use them for internal repression or international aggression . "
conclusion : debatable the government did permit the sale of hawk jets to indonesia when it was still a dictatorship .
it said that it was obliged to permit the sale because the licences had been granted by the previous administration .
critics say that the government has used a generous interpretation of its own guidelines .
among the more controversial decisions , ministers allowed parts for hawk jets to be shipped to zimbabwe in february 2000 .
it later stopped further exports to the country .
what the manifesto said : " we will increase the transparency and accountability of decisions on export licences for arms . "
conclusion : partially met since 1997 , the government has published an annual report on strategic arms export controls , detailing all of the export licence decisions from the previous year , significantly improving the transparency of the arms export licencing system .
the export control bill establishes the right of parliamentary scrutiny of secondary legislation and export control policy .

what the manifesto said : " in government we will strengthen the british aid programme and bring -lsb- international -rsb- development issues back into the mainstream of government decision-making ...
a cabinet minister will lead a new department of international development . "

legislation since then has placed the reduction of poverty at the centre of uk decisions on international assistance .
british contributions to international aid do , however , fall short of the united nations target of 0.7 % of national income .

we have taken the five-year time limit imposed on governments as the point at which to judge whether or not a pledge has been met .
this research is an objective analysis of the government 's record , using the terms of its own " contract with the people " as a benchmark .
the decisions on whether or not a pledge has been met do not include judgements as to the inherent value of any of the pledges or the quality of its delivery .
but we have included important criticisms where applicable .
therefore , the government has been measured against the letter rather than the spirit of its manifesto commitments .
for this reason , the notes below each pledge should be taken into account .
for example , the government can be said to have fulfilled its pledge to introduce an integrated transport policy because the policy now exists .
but it is essential to note that there has been widespread criticism of the government 's handling of transport .
there are five categories : pledge met : the government has met the letter of its manifesto commitment pledge not met : the government has not met the letter of its commitment partly met : some activity in this area has been noted on course : the pledge is likely to be met in the coming months debatable : no objective measure can be made at this stage the bbc 's research identified 229 pledges in the manifesto .
some are omitted here for the sake of brevity .
you can join the debate on the merits of the government 's work by taking part in our talking point debate .

what the manifesto said : " we will use the money saved by scrapping nursery vouchers to guarantee places for four year-olds ... we will set targets for universal provision for three year-olds whose parents want it . "
conclusion : pledge met labour changed the way nurseries are funded and there has been a free place for almost all of the 614,900 four-year-olds in the uk since september 1998 .
in practice the small gap between the number of places and the number of children does not matter as many parents choose alternative provision .
what the manifesto said : " we will invite selected local authorities to pilot early excellence centres combining education and care for the under-fives . "
conclusion : pledge met labour established " early years development partnerships " in 1997 .
the teams brought together by local education authorities , map out and develop early education and childcare services for their area .

we have also secured agreement to make access charges as low as possible . "
conclusion : pledge not met this remains one of the labour government 's most controversial early moves .
announced by tony blair in 1996 , it caught headlines and the public 's growing early interest in the internet without making clear what it meant .
working on the most basic interpretation of the pledge , internet access , the government has fallen short .
according to the latest figures , 97 % of schools have internet access , 100 % of colleges and 90 % of nhs trusts .
but only 67 % of public libraries have access .

we will achieve this by ... piloting literacy summer schools " conclusion : pledge met in 2001 the government earmarked £ 22m for summer schemes aimed at helping children who had failed to reach national literacy and numeracy levels by the end of their primary education .

what the manifesto said : " we will encourage the use of the most effective teaching methods , including phonics for reading and whole class interactive teaching for maths . "
conclusion : pledge met phonics , the relationship between the sound and spelling of words , has been a central part of the national literacy since 1997 .

the scheme is linked to the excellence in cities initiative .
what the manifesto said : " there will be more parent governors and , for the first time , parent representatives on leas . "
conclusion : pledge met the government said in its consultation on school governing bodies that it had " already increased the number of parents on school governing bodies " and parents were given the right to sit on local education authorities in 2000 legislation .

critics say planned reforms of the school governor system may lead to further change .
what the manifesto said : " an independent standing committee will continue to advise us on the implementation of our plans -lsb- for new technology in schools -rsb- . "

what the manifesto said : " exclusion or suspension may sometimes be necessary .
we will pilot pupil referral units -lsb- for these pupils -rsb- .

there are nearly 300 prus in england .
what the manifesto said : " we will improve teacher training , and ensure that all teachers have an induction year when they first qualify , to ensure their suitability for teaching . "
conclusion : pledge met the government has introduced national skill tests for all trainee teachers .
teachers leaving college now spend their first year classed as a " newly qualified teacher " where , in theory , they receive further training .
criticisms and qualifications critics of the government 's education policy say it is difficult to tell whether or not the new system has improved teacher training to any noticeable degree .
what the manifesto said : " we will create a new grade of teachers to recognise the best . "
conclusion : pledge met an advanced skills teacher -lrb- ast -rrb- is a teacher who achieves the very highest standards of classroom practice and who is paid to share his or her skills and experience with other teachers .
part of the idea behind the grade is to provide teachers who do not want to become managers with an alternative career path .
what the manifesto said : " we will establish mandatory qualifications for the post -lsb- of headteacher -rsb- ... "

the government has also enhanced the use and scope of as-levels - though with some controversy .
what the manifesto said : " we will invest public money for training in individual learning accounts which -lsb- people -rsb- can then use to gain the skills they want ... "
conclusion : pledge met the ila programme was set up with a fanfare in september 2000 and aimed to provide people aged 19 or over with up to 80 % of the costs of a training scheme of their choosing .
it was aimed at groups including mothers wishing to return to work .

some pledges have been omitted for the sake of brevity .
no judgement has been made to the inherent value of the pledge , but important criticisms are included where applicable .
you can choose another policy area below : introducton and explanation economy health education home affairs environment welfare constitution foreign / defence what the manifesto said : " as an initial , self-contained reform , not dependent on further reform in the future , the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the house of lords will be ended ... "
conclusion : pledge met the house of lords act 1999 disqualified all hereditary peers for membership of the house , but allowed 90 hereditary peers and the holders of the offices of earl marshal and lord great chamberlain to say on to ensure there were enough peers to conduct business .
the remaining hereditary peers will be excluded when the much postponed ' second stage ' of lords reform takes place .
what the manifesto said : " the appointment of life peers to the house of lords will be reviewed .
our objective will be to ensure that , over time , party appointees as life peers more accurately reflect the proportion of votes cast at the previous general election .
we are committed to maintaining an independent cross-bench presence of life peers . "
conclusion : partially met the government has yet to publish its proposals for completing stage two of lords reform .
a white paper last year came in for criticism and it is expected that legislation will differ from the proposals it made .
while this issue has frustrated the constitutional reform lobby , the government has established a commission to propose non-party peers - though its decisions have been criticised .
what the manifesto said : " a committee of both houses of parliament will be appointed to undertake a wide-ranging review of possible further change -lsb- in the lords -rsb- and then to bring forward proposals for reform . "
conclusion : pledge met a royal commission , chaired by lord wakeham and including members of both houses , recommended a mix of elected and appointed members .
however , the proposals put forward by the government has been criticised for not bearing any resemblance to the wakeham findings .
what the manifesto said : " we believe the house of commons is in need of modernisation and we will ask the house to establish a special select committee to review its procedures . "
conclusion : pledge met the modernisation committee first met in june 1997 and made a series of recommendations that led to some changes such as changing the hours of sittings .
criticisms and qualifications for many , however , it has not gone far enough .
a group of labour mps has led a campaigin to make westminster more family-friendly , including a protracted row over whether female mps can breastfeed in the commons chamber , a campaign they lost .
conservatives have also accused the government of using measures such as shorter hours to kill debate and push through legislation .
what the manifesto said : " prime minister 's questions will be made more effective . "
conclusion : debatable the only change that has been made to prime minister 's questions is to change it from two 15 minute sessions per week to one 30-minute session on wednesdays .
the government says that the longer session leads to a more informed and fairer debate .
the opposition says that there are fewer opportunities to put scrutinise the prime minister .
many outside observers think it 's still the same outdated occasion where the parties sling mud at each other .
what the manifesto said : " ministerial accountability will be reviewed so as to remove recent abuses . "
conclusion : pledge not met critics say that this was an extremely vague commitment .
the best public guide to its completion is the reissued ministerial code .
this document was criticised by the public administration committee for not properly clarifying issues of accountability .
what the manifesto said : " the process for scrutinising european legislation will be overhauled . "
conclusion : partially met the commons agreed in 1998 to widen the scope of european legislation which may be considered by the commons to include documents brought forward under all three pillars of the european union , rather than that brought forward purely through the european commission .
the select committee on european legislation has become the european scrutiny committee and three european standing committees were established .
however , the government also built into this resolution the right to override or expedite scrutiny of legislation in certain circumstances .
what the manifesto said : " the nolan recommendations will be fully implemented and extended to all public bodies . "
conclusion : pledge not met although the government has reiterated its intention to legislate in this area , no formal steps have actually been taken .
a 2001 report by the public administration select committee found that there were ongoing accountability issues with non-departmental bodies .
what the manifesto said : " we will oblige parties to declare the source of all donations above a minimum figure ... "
conclusion : pledge met parties must now declare donations of more than £ 5,000 to their central offices , as well as declaring donations over £ 1,000 to local or constituency parties .
this has not stopped labour 's opponents from pursuing allegations of under-the-counter sleaze against the party as both the bernie ecclestone and lakshmi mittal controversies have shown .
what the manifesto said : " foreign funding -lsb- of political parties -rsb- will be banned . "
conclusion : partially met there are some restrictions under european community law limiting the extent of restriction .
companies registered in another member state but carrying out some business in the uk can still make donations to uk parties .
candidates in northern ireland are exempt from all restrictions .
what the manifesto said : " we are committed to a referendum on the voting system for the house of commons .
an independent commission on voting systems will be appointed early to recommend a proportional alternative to the first-past-the-post system . "
conclusion : pledge not met the jenkins commission produced its report on a new voting system in october 1998 .
the government has not held a referendum on the subject .
what the manifesto said : " we are pledged to a freedom of information act , leading to more open government . "
conclusion : pledge met the freedom of information act received royal assent on 30 november 2000 .
criticisms and qualifications the act will not come into force until 2005 and it has been widely criticised as being as weak .
ministers will still have widespread exemptions from its provisions and some argue that it is actually weaker than the voluntary code introduced by the former conservative prime minister john major .
what the manifesto said : " a sovereign westminster parliament will devolve power to scotland ... and wales . "
conclusion : pledge met the scotland act gained royal assent on 19 november 1998 .
the scottish parliament met for the first time on 12 may 1999 .
the government of wales act was passed in 1998 and the new assembly took up powers in july 1999 .
what the manifesto said : " following a referendum to confirm popular demand , there will be a new deal for london , with a strategic authority and a mayor , each directly elected . "
conclusion : pledge met the directly-elected greater london authority was created in 2000 , under the greater london authority act 1999 .
ken livingstone was elected the first mayor of the city .
what the manifesto said : " demand for directly elected regional government so varies across england that it would be wrong to impose a uniform system .
in time we will introduce legislation to allow the people , region by region , to decide in a referendum whether they want directly elected regional government . "
conclusion : pledge not met while this pledge has not been met within the first five years , the government is expected to shortly propose what it will do .
regional assemblies for england has been hotly debated behind the scenes in whitehall and at westminster .
what the manifesto said : " we will encourage democratic innovations in local government , including pilots of the idea of elected mayors with executive powers in cities . "
conclusion : pledge met the local government act 2000 placed an obligation on councils to take a new structure , either a cabinet style system or a directly elected mayor .
the old committee system has been ditched .
what the manifesto said : " labour is committed to a fair distribution of government grant . "
conclusion : pledge not met labour described this as an ' urgent priority ' for reform .
but it has continued to use the existing grant formulae with no plans to change it before 2003 .
ministers say that a new " fairer and more stable " system will be introduced on 1 april 2003 but there is little detail about how it will work .
what the manifesto said : " councils should not be forced to put their services out to tender , but will be required to obtain best value . "
conclusion : pledge met the local government act 1999 abolished compulsory competitive tendering and introduced " best value " .
councils now have a duty to subject decisions to " the four cs " : competition , challenge , comparison and consultation .
what the manifesto said : " to ensure greater accountability , a proportion of councillors in each locality will be elected annually . "
conclusion : pledge not met metropolitan districts have elections of a third of council seats each year for three out of four years , a system district councils and english shire unitaries can choose to adopt .
however , they can also elect to keep the existing system of elections once every four years .
this four-year system remains in place for all other council structures -lrb- london boroughs , the gla , welsh and scottish unitaries and as well as a number of district and unitary authorities -rrb- .

some pledges have been omitted for the sake of brevity .
no judgement has been made to the inherent value of the pledge , but important criticisms are included where applicable .
you can choose another policy area below : introducton and explanation economy health education home affairs environment welfare constitution foreign / defence what the manifesto said : " all departments must promote policies to sustain the environment .
parliament should have an environmental audit committee to ensure high standards across government . "
conclusion : pledge met whether the government could ever " ensure " that sustainable development was implemented across all departments is open for debate .
however , in november 1997 it did appoint the environmental audit committee charged with looking at how departments were pursuing sustainable development .
what the manifesto said : " a sustainable environment requires above all an effective and integrated transport policy at national , regional and local level ... "
conclusion : pledge met the government published a white paper on integrated transport in 1998 which was later expanded into the 10 year transport plan .
the government also set up an independent commission for integrated transport to " review the government 's progress " .
criticisms and qualifications transport remains one of the most controversial issues for this government .
while it can say that it kept to the letter of the manifesto , critics say that it has so far failed to actually achieve its goals .
the rail network , at the centre of the scheme , remains mired in controversy after the collapse of railtrack .
while urban light railway schemes are underway in some cities , plans to completely overhaul the london underground have been delayed by two years of argument over how to pay for it .
independent analysis of the government 's ambitious 10 year plan has raised serious questions about whether or not the figures will ultimately add up .
campaigners have also complained that early moves towards radical measures such as congestion charging have been hampered by ministerial timidity before the roads lobby .
what the manifesto said : " we will establish more effective and accountable regulation by the rail regulator ; we will ensure that the public subsidy serves the public interest ; and we will establish a new rail authority ... "
conclusion : debatable the government did set up the strategic rail authority in february 2001 and so met part of the pledge .
the sra has published a strategic plan .
however , the effectiveness of the body at providing a plan that meets passenger expectations is up for debate given the continuing controversy over the future of the entire industry .
what the manifesto said : " labour plans a new public / private partnership to improve the underground , safeguard its commitment to the public interest and guarantee value for money ... "
conclusion : on course the government announced in february 2002 that it was going ahead with plans for part-privatisation of the london underground despite wide-spread opposition in the capital , led by the mayor ken livingstone .
the issue remains mired in controversy with opponents insisting that ppp is fundamentally flawed on both financial and safety grounds .
what the manifesto said : " the key to efficient bus services is proper regulation at local level , with partnerships between local councils and bus operators an essential component ... there must be improved provision and enforcement of bus lanes . "
conclusion : pledge met traffic commissioners have been appointed to enforce standards within the bus industry .
the 2000 transport act made provision for " quality partnerships " between local authorities and bus companies .
the government has earmarked some £ 19 billion of the 10-year transport plan for bus improvements , including provision of bus lanes .
it is arguable how well they are enforced .
what the manifesto said : " better parking facilities for cars must be linked to convenient bus services to town centres . "
conclusion : debatable the 10-year plan and commission for integrated transport both pledged more park and ride schemes .
but there is little evidence yet of a systematic improvement in park-ride schemes .
what the manifesto said : " cycling and walking must be made safer , especially around schools . "
conclusion : pledge met the latest figures for deaths and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists show they have fallen compared to the 1994-98 average .
the government launched a road safety strategy in 2000 which included extensive literature aimed at teaching children how to be safe either on foot or on bicycles .

what the manifesto said : " while recognising the need for flexibility in implementation and for certain exemptions , we support the right of employees not to be forced to work more than 48 hours a week ; to an annual holiday entitlement ; and to limited unpaid parental leave . "

the rights to holiday leave and unpaid parental leave are guaranteed by the employment relations act 1999 .
what the manifesto said : " we are reviewing educational finance and maintenance for those older than 16 ... "

the legislation was enacted - just under the wire - on the 1 may 2002 .
what the manifesto said : " the phased release of capital receipts from council house sales will increase the stock of housing for rent " conclusion : pledge met the 1997 local government finance act provides basis for release of capital receipts , but not all of the money has yet been released .
what the manifesto said : " we will examine means of delivering more automatic help to the poorest pensioners " conclusion : pledge met the minimum income guarantee , labour 's renaming of income support , has increased payments to poorer pensioners .
chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown pledged in the 2002 budget to ensure that single pensioners would have a minimum income of £ 100 from 2003 .
however , there are problems with take up .
campaigners estimate that at least 500,000 pensioners are not claiming the support they are entitled to .
what the manifesto said : " we will reform the financial services act so that the scandal of pension mis-selling ... will not happen again . "
conclusion : pledge met the financial services and markets act 2000 established a powerful regulatory body , the financial services authority , whose remits includes the sale of pensions .
the regulator was charged with tackling the fall-out of the pensions mis-selling scandal in two ways .
the most urgent cases comprising 421,000 people were dealt with in the first phase .
the fsa told pensions firms that they had to clear all outstanding less-urgent cases - generally younger people - by 30 june 2002 .
what the manifesto said : " labour will create a new framework - stakeholder pensions ... "
conclusion : pledge met stakeholder pensions became available in april 2001 .
some 750,000 people have bought into the scheme .

what the manifesto said : " we will also seek to develop the administrative structure of serps so as to create a ' citizenship pension ' for those who assume responsibility as carers -lsb- and -rsb- as a result lose out on the pension entitlements ... "
conclusion : pledge met carers and long-term disabled people who are not working will receive credits as part of the new state second pension replacing serps in april 2002 .
what the manifesto said : " we will establish a royal commission to work out a fair system for funding long-term care for the elderly . "
conclusion : pledge met the royal commission reported in march 1999 and recommended that the government provide free nursing and personal care for all .
it also recommended that the government establish a national commission to not only set and monitor standards but represent the rights of the elderly .
criticisms and qualifications the government subsequently ignored the major recommendation for free nursing and personal care , much to the anger of campaigners .
but , as a consequence of devolution , scotland went its own way when holyrood voted to pay for both .
the issue has consistently ranked as among the most important in opinion polls on health provision .
what the manifesto said : " we are committed to an independent inspection and regulation service for residential homes and domiciliary care . "
conclusion : pledge met the care standards act 2000 established the national care standards commission as a statutory independent body .

some pledges have been omitted for the sake of brevity .
no judgement has been made to the inherent value of the pledge , but important criticisms are included where applicable .
you can choose another policy area below : introducton and explanation economy health education home affairs environment welfare constitution foreign / defence what the manifesto said : " we are pledged not to raise the basic or top rates of income tax throughout the next parliament . "
conclusion : pledge met the top-rate has remained at 40 % since 1997 .
the basic rate was actually reduced from 23 % to 22 % in 2000 .
the total tax burden under labour has risen as the government has increased indirect taxation .
what the manifesto said : " our long-term objective is a lower starting rate of income tax of ten pence in the pound . "
conclusion : pledge met the measure was introduced in the 1999 budget .
what the manifesto said : " we will cut vat on fuel to five per cent .
we renew our pledge not to extend vat to food , children 's clothes , books and newspapers and public transport fares . "
conclusion : pledge met chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown cut vat on fuel to 5 % in his first budget of 1997 .
vat has not been levied on food , children 's clothes , books and newspapers and public transport fares .
criticisms and qualifications critics say that while vat has gone down on domestic fuel , the government has done little to help those consuming other fuels such as petrol .
this led to the nationwide fuel protests of september 2000 .
what the manifesto said : " we will match the current target for low and stable inflation of 2 .
5 per cent or less . "
conclusion : pledge met labour 's policy is a 2.5 % target for underlying inflation , with a margin of error of plus or minus 1 % .
inflation has stayed within this band virtually throughout labour 's time in government .
criticisms and qualifications given that the bank of england has been given operational independence to set interest rates , one of the most significant factors to affect inflation , it is debatable whether or not gordon brown or the bank 's monetary policy committee can take more credit for this success .
what the manifesto said : " we will reform the bank of england to ensure that decision-making on monetary policy is more effective , open , accountable and free from short-term political manipulation . "
conclusion : pledge met the bank of england was given independence and control over interest rates in 1997 .
criticisms and qualifications accountability and openness remain outstanding issues for critics .
while the treasury select committee holds hearings for new members of the bank 's monetary policy committee , it can not reject candidates .
secondly , minutes of the mpc 's deliberations are not released until some weeks after its decision on rates .
what the manifesto said : " for the next two years labour will work within the departmental ceilings for spending already announced . "
conclusion : pledge met in 1997-99 , labour stuck rigidly to the spending plans it inherited from the conservatives , even though this sparked opposition on its own backbenches .
what the manifesto said : " we will conduct a central spending review and departmental reviews to assess how to use resources better ... "
conclusion : pledge met the government carried out comprehensive spending reviews in 1998 and 2000 which set the priorities for departmental spending for future years .
what the manifesto said : " we will enforce the ' golden rule ' of public spending - over the economic cycle , we will only borrow to invest and not to fund current expenditure ... "
conclusion : pledge met on the government 's own terms .
the cyclically adjusted current budget has remained in surplus .
criticisms and qualifications critics say that this is was vague statement that is easy to fudge .
for instance , there is a lot of debate about how exactly you define the economic cycle or " investment " itself .
other critics say that the pledge was largely meaningless for the first years of the government as there was little noticeable investment in public services .
what the manifesto said : " we will introduce a new individual savings account and extend the principle of tessas and peps to promote long-term saving . "
conclusion : pledge met individual savings accounts were introduced in april 1999 to replace both tessas and peps .
there are three different versions which allow investors to put investments into tax-free cash savings , insurance or stocks and shares .
what the manifesto said : " we will review corporate and capital gains tax regimes ... "
conclusion : pledge met the government has cut both corporation tax and capital gains taxes with the explicit aim of encouraging investment .
for instance , gordon brown 's 1998 budget cut corporation tax to 30p .
criticisms and qualifications businesses have reacted with some hostility to the 2002 budget saying that the 1p hike on employer 's national insurance contributions -lrb- nics -rrb- is a major blow to small companies and manufacturing .
they say that the nics rise for nhs investment has more than offset positive measures such as tax credits for research and development .
what the manifesto said : " as an early priority we will reform britain 's competition law ... "
conclusion : pledge met the competition act of 1998 set up the competition commission , which has recently conducted investigations into instances of market abuse into banking and supermarkets .
what the manifesto said : " in the utility industries we will promote competition wherever possible .
where competition is not an effective discipline , for example in the water industry which has a poor environmental record and has in most cases been a tax-free zone , we will pursue tough , efficient regulation in the interests of customers ... "
conclusion : partially met the government introduced the water industry act in 1999 and the utilities act in 2000 .
however , further water regulation and telecoms regulation was dropped from the latter act with consumers and environmental groups saying much work remains to be done .
what the manifesto said : " a labour government will overcome the problems that have plagued the private finance initiative at a national level .
we will set priorities between projects , saving time and expense ... "
conclusion : partially met the government has sought to simplify pfi through its new incarnation as public private partnerships .
these have increasingly brought private business into new areas of public service beyond capital spending such as hospital building .
however pfi projects remain a miniscule part of total government spending .
economists , such as the institute for fiscal studies , caution that ministers have not resolved problems over who is ultimately responsible f things go wrong - government or the private sector .
nowhere has this been seen more than with the protracted row over the future of the london underground with the government saying the ppp scheme offers value for money and opponents , led by london mayor ken livingstone , saying that it leave safety in the hands of unaccountable private companies .
what the manifesto said : " we will aim to simplify and speed up the planning process for major infrastructure projects of vital national interest . "
conclusion : pledge not met in july 2001 , stephen byers announced proposals for planning law reform .
the consultation ended in march this year but no legislation has yet been brought forward .
what the manifesto said : " we will ensure that self-financing commercial organisations within the public sector - the post office is a prime example - are given greater commercial freedom ... "
conclusion : pledge met the post office has been given greater freedoms - but has also lost its monopoly on a number of service .
there are controversial proposals to end the post office 's letters monopoly by 2006 , something that the business says threatens its very survival .
what the manifesto said : " support for small businesses will have a major role in our plans for economic growth .
we will provide for statutory interest on late payment of debts " conclusion : pledge met the late payment of commercial debts act 1998 allows firms to claim interest on debts owed , although evidence suggests it is not having much effect .
what the manifesto said : " we will cut unnecessary red tape -lsb- for small businesses -rsb- " conclusion : pledge not met this remains one of the most controversial labour pledges .
the government set up the better regulation task force to look at the burden on business and recommend change .
but the confederation of british industry says that the government has actually imposed an extra £ 16bn of costs on business .
this includes the minimum wage and working time directive .
criticisms and qualifications supporters of the government say that the cbi overstates the case .
it says that measures such as the minimum wage have proved a positive benefit to the british economy by safeguarding wages and putting paid to unscrupulous employers .
the application of the working time directive in the uk is different to others parts of the european union with many sectors allowed exemptions .
what the manifesto said : " we will establish one-stop regional development agencies to co-ordinate regional economic development ... "
conclusion : pledge met they have been up and running for several years , having been established under the terms of the regional development agencies act 1998 .
what the manifesto said : " we support a major push to promote energy conservation - particularly by the promotion of home energy efficiency schemes ¿ " conclusion : pledge met the energy efficiency commitment 2002-05 places an obligation on energy suppliers to promote improvements in energy efficiency by domestic consumers .
what the manifesto said : " we are committed to an energy policy designed to promote cleaner , more efficient energy use and production , including a new and strong drive to develop renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy , and combined heat and power .
we see no economic case for the building of any new nuclear power stations . "
conclusion : pledge met the government says that 5 % of all the uk electricity needs should be met by renewable sources by the end of 2003 and 10 % by 2010 .
a recently-commissioned government report recommended that the uk should set a target of 20 % for 2020 .
criticisms and qualifications nuclear power remains a more difficult issue .
as the current stations are decommissioned , the uk need to either vastly increase green energy production or burn more fossil fuels to fill the gap .
the government 's chief scientific advisor believes that green energy can not meet the need and has called for new nuclear stations .
the government has yet to commit itself one way or the other .
what the manifesto said : " the key elements of the trade union legislation of the 1980s will stay - on ballots , picketing and industrial action . "
conclusion : pledge met none of the reforms cited in the pledge have been repealed .
what the manifesto said : " people should be free to join or not to join a union . "
conclusion : pledge met labour reversed the previous government 's policy of not allowing gchq workers to join a union .
1980s legislation outlawing the closed shop has also been retained , so workers are still free not to join a union if they so wish .
what the manifesto said : " where they do decide to join , and where a majority of the relevant workforce vote in a ballot for the union to represent them , the union should be recognised ... "
conclusion : pledge met unions now get automatic recognition in a firm if more than 50 % of workers are members .
if membership is lower , a union can gain recognition in larger firms where a ballot shows that a majority of those voting , and at least 40 % of those eligible to vote , are in favour of recognition .
what the manifesto said : " we support too the social chapter of the eu , but will deploy our influence in europe to ensure that it develops so as to promote employability and competitiveness , not inflexibility . "
conclusion : pledge met the government signed up to the social chapter early in the last parliament .
it has also pushed competitiveness in europe with varying success .
what the manifesto said : " there should be a statutory level beneath which pay should not fall - with the minimum wage decided not on the basis of a rigid formula but according to the economic circumstances of the time . "
conclusion : pledge met the minimum wage was introduced in april 1999 after a consultation on its level and vociferous campaigning on opposite sides by unions and employers .
since then , it has largely ceased to be a major political issue other than there remains opposition within labour itself and the unions to the split rate which means that 18-21-year-olds are paid less .
low pay campaigners also say that the wage should be automatically increased annually because of inflation .
what the manifesto said : " we will give 250,000 under-25s opportunities for work , education and training . "
conclusion : pledge met one of the government 's key five pledges of the 1997 campaign .
the target was reached on 30 november 2000 .
some 345,000 people have now moved though the new deal scheme for young people into work .
criticisms and qualifications questions have been raised about the costs of the new deal .
it is argued that with unemployment falling from before labour came to power , this group would have found work without needing the complicated scheme .
what the manifesto said : " all young people will be offered part-time or full-time education after the age of 16 .
any under-18 year-old in a job will have the right to study on an approved course for qualifications at college . "
conclusion : partially met all young people aged 16-18 are , of course , entitled to full or part-time education .
in-work training is more complicated .
employees aged 16 or 17 are only eligible to paid time off for study or training if they meet certain criteria based on their previous educational achievement .
in theory this meets the manifesto pledge but in practice means that some may not have access .
what the manifesto said : " we will replace the failed youth training scheme with our new target 2000 programme , offering young people high-quality education and training . "
conclusion : pledge not met it is not at all clear what target 2000 meant or was intended to be .
some of its issues were addressed by the new deal and other organisations .
one of the cornerstones , however , of the government 's life-long learning policy , individual learning accounts -lrb- ilas -rrb- , was suspended in december 2001 after reports of wide-scale fraud .
what the manifesto said : " once the youngest child is in the second term of full-time school , lone parents will be offered advice to develop a package of job search , training and after-school care to help them off benefit . "
conclusion : pledge met 200,000 lone parents have been through the new deal for lone parents - around half have found work .
40 % of lone parents are in work - the government aim to get this up to 70 % .
but two thirds of single parents are living on or below income support level - compared to 27 % of two parent families .
what the manifesto said : " in new and innovative ' employment zones ' , personal job accounts will combine money currently available for benefits and training , to offer the unemployed new options ... we will co-ordinate benefits , employment and career services ¿ " conclusion : pledge met the government launched the first fifteen employment zones on 9 march 2000 .
the zones aim to provide solutions for areas experiencing high levels of long term unemployment .
what the manifesto said : " we will start with a clampdown on housing benefit fraud , estimated to cost £ 2 billion a year and will maintain action against benefit fraud of all kinds ... "
conclusion : debatable the 2001 social security fraud act aims to improve measures to cut benefit fraud .
defrauders face ' a two strikes and you 're out ' .
critics says the need for this proves the failure of the 1999 anti-fraud strategy .
fraud in social security benefits costs the taxpayer £ 4 billion every year according to the commons ' public accounts committee , which supports many of the government 's initiatives but worries at the lack of urgency .

some pledges have been omitted for the sake of brevity .
no judgement has been made to the inherent value of the pledge , but important criticisms are included where applicable .
you can choose another policy area below : introducton and explanation economy health education home affairs environment welfare constitution foreign / defence what the manifesto said : " we will relieve the police of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens to get more officers back on the beat . "
conclusion : on course the police reform bill -lrb- currently going through parliament -rrb- contains provisions to increase the powers of case managers , detention staff and scene of crime officers , so as to give regular police officers more opportunity to be seen on the beat .
the government has heralded the legislation as one of the most important changes to british policing in years .
criticisms and qualifications but the proposals are not without controversy .
the government wants to introduce " community support officers " who will have some powers in matters such as crowd control , truancy and minor offences such as littering .
police oppose this proposal saying that it erodes their powers and confuses the situation by creating a level of policing without actually using police .
the house of lords has inflicted a series of defeats on the government over the bill , but ministers insist that these will be reversed in the commons .
what the manifesto said : " labour will decentralise the cps , with local crown prosecutors co-operating more effectively with local police forces . "
conclusion : pledge met in 1999 the cps was split up into 42 regions to match police constabularies .
further changes are in the pipeline such as placing some cps lawyers in the same buildings as police officers .
what the manifesto said : " we will halve the time it takes to get persistent young offenders from arrest to sentencing " conclusion : pledge met this was one of labour 's five key manifesto pledges which appeared on special cards given out during the 1997 general election .
in 1996 , dealing with a persistent young offender took an average of 142 days .
in june 2001 , this had been cut to 69 days , two days below the government 's target of 71 .
what the manifesto said : " we will replace widespread repeat cautions -lsb- for young offenders -rsb- with a single final warning " conclusion : pledge met the 1998 crime and disorder act replaced the existing system of cautioning with the new " final warning " .
for a first offence , young offenders can expect either a reprimand , a final warning or criminal charges depending on the seriousness of the offence .
following one reprimand , any further offence will lead to a warning or a charge .
any further offending will normally result in a charge .
police can still give a second warning where the latest offence is less serious than a previous one and more than two years have passed since the first warning .
what the manifesto said : " we will bring together youth offender teams in every area " conclusion : pledge met the crime and disorder act 1998 placed new duties on local authorities with education and social services responsibilities , chief officers of police , police authorities , probation committees and health authorities in england and wales to establish youth offending teams .
these bodies are now expected to ensure that there is an appropriate youth justice system in their area which aims to match offending with the appropriate solution , for instance tackling social problems in the home .
what the manifesto said : " we will streamline the system of youth courts to make it far more effective . "
conclusion : pledge met the government is implementing " referral orders " nationwide .
when a young offender pleads guilty in court , they are referred to a special panel drawn from the local community .
this panel examines the causes of the offending and is charged with drawing up a plan to tackle it .
this can involve a contract of sorts between the panel , the offender and parents .
what the manifesto said : " seek to ensure that prison regimes are constructive and require inmates to face up to their offending behaviour . "
conclusion : pledge met although the weekly average number of hours of purposeful activity per prisoner has remained constant at 23.8 , the number of hours of education rose between 1997 and 2001 .
the home office instructed prisons to have a greater focus on literacy and numeracy in the hope of breaking the cycle of offending .
the number of prisoners completing offending behaviour programmes has risen substantially since 1997 , criticisms and qualifications in 2000-01 the prison service failed to meet half of its own targets including those for purposeful activity , literacy and numeracy .
the number of offenders completing sex offender treatment programme falls short of the targets .
what the manifesto said : " we will implement an effective sentencing system for all the main offences to ensure greater consistency and stricter punishment for serious repeat offenders . "
conclusion : pledge not met the 2001 criminal justice bill included a promise to " provide a vehicle for legislation to implement parts of the sentencing review " .
these changes were to draw on the conclusions of the halliday report on sentencing , but the legislation has yet to be proposed .
the government , however , has recently taken delivery of a major report into the future of the criminal court system .
this has recommended a radical overhaul of the system including the introduction of an intermediate tier of courts aimed at speeding up the process and ensuring more consistency .
what the manifesto said : " child protection orders will deal with young children suffering neglect by parents because they are left out on their own far too late at night . "
conclusion : pledge met local child curfew orders were first introduced in the crime and disorder act 1998 to keep children under 10 off the streets at night .
in august 2001 the government announced curfew orders would be extended to children aged up to 15 .
criticisms and qualifications while the government can claim that it has met the pledge by passing the law , there has been little take up of the orders .
for more than a year after they were first introduced , no local authority , charged with dealing with the problem , sought a curfew order .
their reluctance to use the law was based on a belief that they would prove unenforceable .
ministers have moved to reform the scheme , saying that it should be just one weapon against youth offending .
anti-social behaviour orders , which can lead to punishment of parents , have proved more popular among local authorities .
what the manifesto said : " new parental responsibility orders will make parents face up to their responsibility for their children 's misbehaviour . "
conclusion : pledge met introduced by the crime and disorder act 1998 , councils can apply for parenting orders to be imposed if a child has committed a criminal offence or has been truanting or has been seriously anti-social on the streets .
what the manifesto said : " community safety orders will deal with threatening and disruptive criminal neighbours . "
conclusion : pledge met now called anti-social behaviour orders , these were introduced by the crime and disorder act 1998 .
466 orders have been imposed since went on-stream in april 1999 , costing an average £ 5,360 .
what the manifesto said : " there will be legislation to allow individual mps a free vote for a complete ban on handguns . "
conclusion : pledge met the firearms -lrb- amendment -rrb- -lrb- no.2 -rrb- act 1997 received royal assent in november 1997 , after a free vote .
as then home secretary , jack straw said at the time , " i strongly commend the bill 's proposals to the house , but i want to make it crystal clear that - as in opposition - it will be a matter for my hon friends ' individual consciences to decide whether to support or oppose the measure tonight . "
what the manifesto said : " we will tackle the unacceptable level of anti-social behaviour and crime on our streets .
our ' zero tolerance ' approach will ensure that petty criminality among young offenders is seriously addressed . "
conclusion : pledge not met although the government have introduced various initiatives -lrb- see above -rrb- , street crime has continued to rise and has become something of a political hot potato .
london has suffered some of the worst problems with robberies rising from 36,317 to 47,636 in the 11 months to the end of february 2002 .
in april the prime minister pledged to halt the rise of street crime in london within five months .
what the manifesto said : " we will create a new offence of racial harassment and a new crime of racially motivated violence to protect ethnic minorities from intimidation . "
conclusion : pledge met legislation covering this issue became law as part of the crime and disorder act 1998 .
what the manifesto said : " labour will appoint an anti-drugs supremo to co-ordinate our battle against drugs across all government departments . "
conclusion : pledge met the former chief constable of west yorkshire , keith hellawell , became the first anti-drugs co-ordinator - dubbed the " drugs czar " - in 1998 .
mr hellawell was charged with knocking together whitehall heads to make sure that drugs policy across government was co-ordinated .
criticisms and qualifications however , three years into his strategy , he left the post in august 2001 after being effectively sidelined by the new home secretary david blunkett .
mr blunkett took responsibility for drugs policy and appointed a minister to oversee policy .
what the manifesto said : " we will ensure that victims are kept fully informed of the progress of their case , and why charges may have been downgraded or dropped . "
conclusion : pledge not met the victims ' charter , which sets out what victims can expect in the handling of their cases , has not been revised since 1996 .
in february 2001 , the home office issued a consultation on a possible update of the document , but no further action has been taken .
what the manifesto said : " greater protection will be provided for victims in rape and serious sexual offence trials and for those subject to intimidation , including witnesses . "
conclusion : pledge met the youth justice and criminal evidence act 1999 introduced a range of measures to protect witnesses .
these include a ban on cross-examination of rape victims by the defendant in person ; measures such as recorded pre-trial cross-examination to help child witnesses ; use of screens , live tv links and video recorded interviews of witnesses .
what the manifesto said : " we will place a new responsibility on local authorities to develop statutory partnerships to help prevent crime .

some pledges have been omitted for the sake of brevity .
no judgement has been made to the inherent value of the pledge , but important criticisms are included where applicable .
you can choose another policy area below : introducton and explanation economy health education home affairs environment welfare constitution foreign / defence what the manifesto said : " we will relieve the police of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens to get more officers back on the beat . "
conclusion : on course the police reform bill -lrb- currently going through parliament -rrb- contains provisions to increase the powers of case managers , detention staff and scene of crime officers , so as to give regular police officers more opportunity to be seen on the beat .
the government has heralded the legislation as one of the most important changes to british policing in years .
criticisms and qualifications but the proposals are not without controversy .
the government wants to introduce " community support officers " who will have some powers in matters such as crowd control , truancy and minor offences such as littering .
police oppose this proposal saying that it erodes their powers and confuses the situation by creating a level of policing without actually using police .
the house of lords has inflicted a series of defeats on the government over the bill , but ministers insist that these will be reversed in the commons .
what the manifesto said : " labour will decentralise the cps , with local crown prosecutors co-operating more effectively with local police forces . "
conclusion : pledge met in 1999 the cps was split up into 42 regions to match police constabularies .
further changes are in the pipeline such as placing some cps lawyers in the same buildings as police officers .
what the manifesto said : " we will halve the time it takes to get persistent young offenders from arrest to sentencing " conclusion : pledge met this was one of labour 's five key manifesto pledges which appeared on special cards given out during the 1997 general election .
in 1996 , dealing with a persistent young offender took an average of 142 days .
in june 2001 , this had been cut to 69 days , two days below the government 's target of 71 .
what the manifesto said : " we will replace widespread repeat cautions -lsb- for young offenders -rsb- with a single final warning " conclusion : pledge met the 1998 crime and disorder act replaced the existing system of cautioning with the new " final warning " .
for a first offence , young offenders can expect either a reprimand , a final warning or criminal charges depending on the seriousness of the offence .
following one reprimand , any further offence will lead to a warning or a charge .
any further offending will normally result in a charge .
police can still give a second warning where the latest offence is less serious than a previous one and more than two years have passed since the first warning .
what the manifesto said : " we will bring together youth offender teams in every area " conclusion : pledge met the crime and disorder act 1998 placed new duties on local authorities with education and social services responsibilities , chief officers of police , police authorities , probation committees and health authorities in england and wales to establish youth offending teams .
these bodies are now expected to ensure that there is an appropriate youth justice system in their area which aims to match offending with the appropriate solution , for instance tackling social problems in the home .
what the manifesto said : " we will streamline the system of youth courts to make it far more effective . "
conclusion : pledge met the government is implementing " referral orders " nationwide .
when a young offender pleads guilty in court , they are referred to a special panel drawn from the local community .

this can involve a contract of sorts between the panel , the offender and parents .
what the manifesto said : " seek to ensure that prison regimes are constructive and require inmates to face up to their offending behaviour . "
conclusion : pledge met although the weekly average number of hours of purposeful activity per prisoner has remained constant at 23.8 , the number of hours of education rose between 1997 and 2001 .
the home office instructed prisons to have a greater focus on literacy and numeracy in the hope of breaking the cycle of offending .
the number of prisoners completing offending behaviour programmes has risen substantially since 1997 , criticisms and qualifications in 2000-01 the prison service failed to meet half of its own targets including those for purposeful activity , literacy and numeracy .
the number of offenders completing sex offender treatment programme falls short of the targets .
what the manifesto said : " we will implement an effective sentencing system for all the main offences to ensure greater consistency and stricter punishment for serious repeat offenders . "
conclusion : pledge not met the 2001 criminal justice bill included a promise to " provide a vehicle for legislation to implement parts of the sentencing review " .
these changes were to draw on the conclusions of the halliday report on sentencing , but the legislation has yet to be proposed .
the government , however , has recently taken delivery of a major report into the future of the criminal court system .
this has recommended a radical overhaul of the system including the introduction of an intermediate tier of courts aimed at speeding up the process and ensuring more consistency .
what the manifesto said : " child protection orders will deal with young children suffering neglect by parents because they are left out on their own far too late at night . "
conclusion : pledge met local child curfew orders were first introduced in the crime and disorder act 1998 to keep children under 10 off the streets at night .
in august 2001 the government announced curfew orders would be extended to children aged up to 15 .
criticisms and qualifications while the government can claim that it has met the pledge by passing the law , there has been little take up of the orders .
for more than a year after they were first introduced , no local authority , charged with dealing with the problem , sought a curfew order .
their reluctance to use the law was based on a belief that they would prove unenforceable .
ministers have moved to reform the scheme , saying that it should be just one weapon against youth offending .
anti-social behaviour orders , which can lead to punishment of parents , have proved more popular among local authorities .
what the manifesto said : " new parental responsibility orders will make parents face up to their responsibility for their children 's misbehaviour . "
conclusion : pledge met introduced by the crime and disorder act 1998 , councils can apply for parenting orders to be imposed if a child has committed a criminal offence or has been truanting or has been seriously anti-social on the streets .
what the manifesto said : " community safety orders will deal with threatening and disruptive criminal neighbours . "
conclusion : pledge met now called anti-social behaviour orders , these were introduced by the crime and disorder act 1998 .
466 orders have been imposed since went on-stream in april 1999 , costing an average £ 5,360 .

conclusion : pledge met the firearms -lrb- amendment -rrb- -lrb- no.2 -rrb- act 1997 received royal assent in november 1997 , after a free vote .
as then home secretary , jack straw said at the time , " i strongly commend the bill 's proposals to the house , but i want to make it crystal clear that - as in opposition - it will be a matter for my hon friends ' individual consciences to decide whether to support or oppose the measure tonight . "
what the manifesto said : " we will tackle the unacceptable level of anti-social behaviour and crime on our streets .
our ' zero tolerance ' approach will ensure that petty criminality among young offenders is seriously addressed . "
conclusion : pledge not met although the government have introduced various initiatives -lrb- see above -rrb- , street crime has continued to rise and has become something of a political hot potato .
london has suffered some of the worst problems with robberies rising from 36,317 to 47,636 in the 11 months to the end of february 2002 .
in april the prime minister pledged to halt the rise of street crime in london within five months .
what the manifesto said : " we will create a new offence of racial harassment and a new crime of racially motivated violence to protect ethnic minorities from intimidation . "
conclusion : pledge met legislation covering this issue became law as part of the crime and disorder act 1998 .
what the manifesto said : " labour will appoint an anti-drugs supremo to co-ordinate our battle against drugs across all government departments . "
conclusion : pledge met the former chief constable of west yorkshire , keith hellawell , became the first anti-drugs co-ordinator - dubbed the " drugs czar " - in 1998 .
mr hellawell was charged with knocking together whitehall heads to make sure that drugs policy across government was co-ordinated .
criticisms and qualifications however , three years into his strategy , he left the post in august 2001 after being effectively sidelined by the new home secretary david blunkett .
mr blunkett took responsibility for drugs policy and appointed a minister to oversee policy .
what the manifesto said : " we will ensure that victims are kept fully informed of the progress of their case , and why charges may have been downgraded or dropped . "
conclusion : pledge not met the victims ' charter , which sets out what victims can expect in the handling of their cases , has not been revised since 1996 .
in february 2001 , the home office issued a consultation on a possible update of the document , but no further action has been taken .
what the manifesto said : " greater protection will be provided for victims in rape and serious sexual offence trials and for those subject to intimidation , including witnesses . "
conclusion : pledge met the youth justice and criminal evidence act 1999 introduced a range of measures to protect witnesses .
these include a ban on cross-examination of rape victims by the defendant in person ; measures such as recorded pre-trial cross-examination to help child witnesses ; use of screens , live tv links and video recorded interviews of witnesses .
what the manifesto said : " we will place a new responsibility on local authorities to develop statutory partnerships to help prevent crime .
local councils will then be required to set targets for the reduction of crime and disorder in their area . "

what the manifesto said : " we will pilot the use of compulsory drug testing and treatment orders for offenders to ensure that the link between drug addiction and crime is broken . "
conclusion : pledge met the provisions in the criminal justice and court services bill currently before parliament will build upon drug testing already being carried out through the drug treatment and testing order and drug testing in prison .
the bill provides for the compulsory drug testing of offenders and alleged offenders at various points in the criminal justice system .
what the manifesto said : " -lsb- we will bring -rsb- remand delays down to the national targets " conclusion : pledge not met this pledge aimed to find the money needed to fund the compulsory drug treatment orders for offenders .
legislation in 1998 created a framework for new time limits which were eventually set in 2001 after consultation .
but , the remand time limits only apply to young offenders .
what the manifesto said : " we will attack the drug problem in prisons .
in addition to random drug testing of all prisoners we will aim for a voluntary testing unit in every prison for prisoners ready to prove they are drug-free . "
conclusion : pledge met in 1998 the government allocated £ 76m to dealing with drugs in prisons .
this included £ 17m for voluntary testing units .
since then , some 55,000 prisoners have taken part or continue to take part in the scheme .
what the manifesto said : " we will by statute incorporate the european convention on human rights into uk law to bring these rights home and allow our people access to them in their national courts " conclusion : pledge met the human rights act gained royal assent on 9 november 1998 .
what the manifesto said : " we will ensure swift and fair decisions on whether -lsb- an asylum seeker -rsb- can stay or go " conclusion : debatable the 1999 asylum and immigration act was introduced with the aim of making the system faster , firmer and fairer .
a year later it was mired in chaos and controversy with accusations that it could not cope with the scale of the task .
the backlog of claims is finally being reduced , decisions being made more quickly but doubts remain about fairness .

some pledges have been omitted for the sake of brevity .
no judgement has been made to the inherent value of the pledge , but important criticisms are included where applicable .
you can choose another policy area below : introducton and explanation economy health education home affairs environment welfare constitution foreign / defence what the manifesto said : " we are pledged not to raise the basic or top rates of income tax throughout the next parliament . "
conclusion : pledge met the top-rate has remained at 40 % since 1997 .
the basic rate was actually reduced from 23 % to 22 % in 2000 .
the total tax burden under labour has risen as the government has increased indirect taxation .
what the manifesto said : " our long-term objective is a lower starting rate of income tax of ten pence in the pound . "
conclusion : pledge met the measure was introduced in the 1999 budget .
what the manifesto said : " we will cut vat on fuel to five per cent .
we renew our pledge not to extend vat to food , children 's clothes , books and newspapers and public transport fares . "
conclusion : pledge met chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown cut vat on fuel to 5 % in his first budget of 1997 .
vat has not been levied on food , children 's clothes , books and newspapers and public transport fares .
criticisms and qualifications critics say that while vat has gone down on domestic fuel , the government has done little to help those consuming other fuels such as petrol .
this led to the nationwide fuel protests of september 2000 .
what the manifesto said : " we will match the current target for low and stable inflation of 2 .
5 per cent or less . "
conclusion : pledge met labour 's policy is a 2.5 % target for underlying inflation , with a margin of error of plus or minus 1 % .
inflation has stayed within this band virtually throughout labour 's time in government .
criticisms and qualifications given that the bank of england has been given operational independence to set interest rates , one of the most significant factors to affect inflation , it is debatable whether or not gordon brown or the bank 's monetary policy committee can take more credit for this success .
what the manifesto said : " we will reform the bank of england to ensure that decision-making on monetary policy is more effective , open , accountable and free from short-term political manipulation . "
conclusion : pledge met the bank of england was given independence and control over interest rates in 1997 .
criticisms and qualifications accountability and openness remain outstanding issues for critics .
while the treasury select committee holds hearings for new members of the bank 's monetary policy committee , it can not reject candidates .
secondly , minutes of the mpc 's deliberations are not released until some weeks after its decision on rates .
what the manifesto said : " for the next two years labour will work within the departmental ceilings for spending already announced . "
conclusion : pledge met in 1997-99 , labour stuck rigidly to the spending plans it inherited from the conservatives , even though this sparked opposition on its own backbenches .
what the manifesto said : " we will conduct a central spending review and departmental reviews to assess how to use resources better ... "
conclusion : pledge met the government carried out comprehensive spending reviews in 1998 and 2000 which set the priorities for departmental spending for future years .
what the manifesto said : " we will enforce the ' golden rule ' of public spending - over the economic cycle , we will only borrow to invest and not to fund current expenditure ... "
conclusion : pledge met on the government 's own terms .
the cyclically adjusted current budget has remained in surplus .
criticisms and qualifications critics say that this is was vague statement that is easy to fudge .
for instance , there is a lot of debate about how exactly you define the economic cycle or " investment " itself .
other critics say that the pledge was largely meaningless for the first years of the government as there was little noticeable investment in public services .
what the manifesto said : " we will introduce a new individual savings account and extend the principle of tessas and peps to promote long-term saving . "
conclusion : pledge met individual savings accounts were introduced in april 1999 to replace both tessas and peps .
there are three different versions which allow investors to put investments into tax-free cash savings , insurance or stocks and shares .
what the manifesto said : " we will review corporate and capital gains tax regimes ... "
conclusion : pledge met the government has cut both corporation tax and capital gains taxes with the explicit aim of encouraging investment .
for instance , gordon brown 's 1998 budget cut corporation tax to 30p .
criticisms and qualifications businesses have reacted with some hostility to the 2002 budget saying that the 1p hike on employer 's national insurance contributions -lrb- nics -rrb- is a major blow to small companies and manufacturing .
they say that the nics rise for nhs investment has more than offset positive measures such as tax credits for research and development .
what the manifesto said : " as an early priority we will reform britain 's competition law ... "
conclusion : pledge met the competition act of 1998 set up the competition commission , which has recently conducted investigations into instances of market abuse into banking and supermarkets .
what the manifesto said : " in the utility industries we will promote competition wherever possible .
where competition is not an effective discipline , for example in the water industry which has a poor environmental record and has in most cases been a tax-free zone , we will pursue tough , efficient regulation in the interests of customers ... "
conclusion : partially met the government introduced the water industry act in 1999 and the utilities act in 2000 .
however , further water regulation and telecoms regulation was dropped from the latter act with consumers and environmental groups saying much work remains to be done .
what the manifesto said : " a labour government will overcome the problems that have plagued the private finance initiative at a national level .
we will set priorities between projects , saving time and expense ... "
conclusion : partially met the government has sought to simplify pfi through its new incarnation as public private partnerships .
these have increasingly brought private business into new areas of public service beyond capital spending such as hospital building .
however pfi projects remain a miniscule part of total government spending .
economists , such as the institute for fiscal studies , caution that ministers have not resolved problems over who is ultimately responsible f things go wrong - government or the private sector .
nowhere has this been seen more than with the protracted row over the future of the london underground with the government saying the ppp scheme offers value for money and opponents , led by london mayor ken livingstone , saying that it leave safety in the hands of unaccountable private companies .
what the manifesto said : " we will aim to simplify and speed up the planning process for major infrastructure projects of vital national interest . "
conclusion : pledge not met in july 2001 , stephen byers announced proposals for planning law reform .
the consultation ended in march this year but no legislation has yet been brought forward .
what the manifesto said : " we will ensure that self-financing commercial organisations within the public sector - the post office is a prime example - are given greater commercial freedom ... "
conclusion : pledge met the post office has been given greater freedoms - but has also lost its monopoly on a number of service .
there are controversial proposals to end the post office 's letters monopoly by 2006 , something that the business says threatens its very survival .
what the manifesto said : " support for small businesses will have a major role in our plans for economic growth .
we will provide for statutory interest on late payment of debts " conclusion : pledge met the late payment of commercial debts act 1998 allows firms to claim interest on debts owed , although evidence suggests it is not having much effect .
what the manifesto said : " we will cut unnecessary red tape -lsb- for small businesses -rsb- " conclusion : pledge not met this remains one of the most controversial labour pledges .
the government set up the better regulation task force to look at the burden on business and recommend change .
but the confederation of british industry says that the government has actually imposed an extra £ 16bn of costs on business .
this includes the minimum wage and working time directive .
criticisms and qualifications supporters of the government say that the cbi overstates the case .
it says that measures such as the minimum wage have proved a positive benefit to the british economy by safeguarding wages and putting paid to unscrupulous employers .
the application of the working time directive in the uk is different to others parts of the european union with many sectors allowed exemptions .
what the manifesto said : " we will establish one-stop regional development agencies to co-ordinate regional economic development ... "
conclusion : pledge met they have been up and running for several years , having been established under the terms of the regional development agencies act 1998 .
what the manifesto said : " we support a major push to promote energy conservation - particularly by the promotion of home energy efficiency schemes ¿ " conclusion : pledge met the energy efficiency commitment 2002-05 places an obligation on energy suppliers to promote improvements in energy efficiency by domestic consumers .
what the manifesto said : " we are committed to an energy policy designed to promote cleaner , more efficient energy use and production , including a new and strong drive to develop renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy , and combined heat and power .
we see no economic case for the building of any new nuclear power stations . "
conclusion : pledge met the government says that 5 % of all the uk electricity needs should be met by renewable sources by the end of 2003 and 10 % by 2010 .
a recently-commissioned government report recommended that the uk should set a target of 20 % for 2020 .
criticisms and qualifications nuclear power remains a more difficult issue .
as the current stations are decommissioned , the uk need to either vastly increase green energy production or burn more fossil fuels to fill the gap .
the government 's chief scientific advisor believes that green energy can not meet the need and has called for new nuclear stations .
the government has yet to commit itself one way or the other .
what the manifesto said : " the key elements of the trade union legislation of the 1980s will stay - on ballots , picketing and industrial action . "
conclusion : pledge met none of the reforms cited in the pledge have been repealed .

what the manifesto said : " we will reduce class sizes for five , six and seven year-olds to 30 or under , by phasing out the assisted places scheme ... "
conclusion : pledge met in september 2001 there were 63,300 infant classes taught by one teacher .
of these , only 68 classes - 0.1 % of the total - included more than 30 pupils in circumstances which break the rules .
what the manifesto said : " we will use the money saved by scrapping nursery vouchers to guarantee places for four year-olds ... we will set targets for universal provision for three year-olds whose parents want it . "
conclusion : pledge met labour changed the way nurseries are funded and there has been a free place for almost all of the 614,900 four-year-olds in the uk since september 1998 .
in practice the small gap between the number of places and the number of children does not matter as many parents choose alternative provision .
what the manifesto said : " we will invite selected local authorities to pilot early excellence centres combining education and care for the under-fives . "
conclusion : pledge met labour established " early years development partnerships " in 1997 .
the teams brought together by local education authorities , map out and develop early education and childcare services for their area .
what the manifesto said : " we have agreed with british telecom and the cable companies that they will wire up schools , libraries , colleges and hospitals to the information superhighway free of charge .
we have also secured agreement to make access charges as low as possible . "
conclusion : pledge not met this remains one of the labour government 's most controversial early moves .
announced by tony blair in 1996 , it caught headlines and the public 's growing early interest in the internet without making clear what it meant .
working on the most basic interpretation of the pledge , internet access , the government has fallen short .

but only 67 % of public libraries have access .

what the manifesto said : " for those failing schools unable to improve , ministers will order a ' fresh start ' - close the school and start afresh on the same site . "

there are currently 25 schools under the programme , 15 of which are secondary .
what the manifesto said : " we must recognise the three ' r 's for what they are - building blocks of all learning that must be taught better .
we will achieve this by ... piloting literacy summer schools " conclusion : pledge met in 2001 the government earmarked £ 22m for summer schemes aimed at helping children who had failed to reach national literacy and numeracy levels by the end of their primary education .
criticisms and qualifications critics of the scheme say that some of the work has been pitched at too low a level , meaning that some of the children may see their literacy deteriorate while on the course , even if their self-esteem rises .
what the manifesto said : " we will encourage the use of the most effective teaching methods , including phonics for reading and whole class interactive teaching for maths . "
conclusion : pledge met phonics , the relationship between the sound and spelling of words , has been a central part of the national literacy since 1997 .
what the manifesto said : 15 .

the scheme is linked to the excellence in cities initiative .
what the manifesto said : " there will be more parent governors and , for the first time , parent representatives on leas . "
conclusion : pledge met the government said in its consultation on school governing bodies that it had " already increased the number of parents on school governing bodies " and parents were given the right to sit on local education authorities in 2000 legislation .
criticisms and qualifications the statement can not be easily verified because there are no central figures on parent representation .
critics say planned reforms of the school governor system may lead to further change .
what the manifesto said : " an independent standing committee will continue to advise us on the implementation of our plans -lsb- for new technology in schools -rsb- . "
conclusion : pledge not met in opposition , labour used the independent stevenson committee to advise it on information technology policy for education .
the committee did not continue its work after it published its report .
what the manifesto said : " public / private partnerships will improve the condition of school buildings . "
conclusion : pledge met in as much as the budget for school building has risen from £ 683m in 1996/97 to more than £ 2bn this year .
it is set to reach £ 3.5bn by 2004 .
what the manifesto said : " exclusion or suspension may sometimes be necessary .
we will pilot pupil referral units -lsb- for these pupils -rsb- .

there are nearly 300 prus in england .
what the manifesto said : " we will improve teacher training , and ensure that all teachers have an induction year when they first qualify , to ensure their suitability for teaching . "
conclusion : pledge met the government has introduced national skill tests for all trainee teachers .
teachers leaving college now spend their first year classed as a " newly qualified teacher " where , in theory , they receive further training .
criticisms and qualifications critics of the government 's education policy say it is difficult to tell whether or not the new system has improved teacher training to any noticeable degree .
what the manifesto said : " we will create a new grade of teachers to recognise the best . "
conclusion : pledge met an advanced skills teacher -lrb- ast -rrb- is a teacher who achieves the very highest standards of classroom practice and who is paid to share his or her skills and experience with other teachers .
part of the idea behind the grade is to provide teachers who do not want to become managers with an alternative career path .
what the manifesto said : " we will establish mandatory qualifications for the post -lsb- of headteacher -rsb- ... "
conclusion : pledge not met three training programmes are currently administered by the national college for school leadership .

what the manifesto said : " the improvement and expansion needed -lsb- in higher education -rsb- can not be funded out of general taxation .
the costs of student maintenance should be repaid by graduates on an income-related basis ... "
conclusion : pledge met the government reformed student maintenance funding , changing the terms of repayment and privatising some of the debt .

students in scotland do not have to pay tuition fees at its universities ; but students from other parts of the uk studying there do .
the northern ireland assembly has also considered changing its system .
what the manifesto said : " our new university for industry , collaborating with the open university , will bring new opportunities to adults seeking to develop their potential . "

the government has also enhanced the use and scope of as-levels - though with some controversy .
what the manifesto said : " we will invest public money for training in individual learning accounts which -lsb- people -rsb- can then use to gain the skills they want ... "
conclusion : pledge met the ila programme was set up with a fanfare in september 2000 and aimed to provide people aged 19 or over with up to 80 % of the costs of a training scheme of their choosing .
it was aimed at groups including mothers wishing to return to work .
criticisms and qualifications in november 2001 the scheme was suspended in england amid revelations that the programme was open to fraud .
the government says that it is committed to reintroducing a scheme , but not until it has worked out what went wrong .

some pledges have been omitted for the sake of brevity .
no judgement has been made to the inherent value of the pledge , but important criticisms are included where applicable .
you can choose another policy area below : introducton and explanation economy health education home affairs environment welfare constitution foreign / defence what the manifesto said : " as an initial , self-contained reform , not dependent on further reform in the future , the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the house of lords will be ended ... "
conclusion : pledge met the house of lords act 1999 disqualified all hereditary peers for membership of the house , but allowed 90 hereditary peers and the holders of the offices of earl marshal and lord great chamberlain to say on to ensure there were enough peers to conduct business .
the remaining hereditary peers will be excluded when the much postponed ' second stage ' of lords reform takes place .
what the manifesto said : " the appointment of life peers to the house of lords will be reviewed .
our objective will be to ensure that , over time , party appointees as life peers more accurately reflect the proportion of votes cast at the previous general election .
we are committed to maintaining an independent cross-bench presence of life peers . "
conclusion : partially met the government has yet to publish its proposals for completing stage two of lords reform .
a white paper last year came in for criticism and it is expected that legislation will differ from the proposals it made .
while this issue has frustrated the constitutional reform lobby , the government has established a commission to propose non-party peers - though its decisions have been criticised .
what the manifesto said : " a committee of both houses of parliament will be appointed to undertake a wide-ranging review of possible further change -lsb- in the lords -rsb- and then to bring forward proposals for reform . "
conclusion : pledge met a royal commission , chaired by lord wakeham and including members of both houses , recommended a mix of elected and appointed members .
however , the proposals put forward by the government has been criticised for not bearing any resemblance to the wakeham findings .
what the manifesto said : " we believe the house of commons is in need of modernisation and we will ask the house to establish a special select committee to review its procedures . "
conclusion : pledge met the modernisation committee first met in june 1997 and made a series of recommendations that led to some changes such as changing the hours of sittings .
criticisms and qualifications for many , however , it has not gone far enough .
a group of labour mps has led a campaigin to make westminster more family-friendly , including a protracted row over whether female mps can breastfeed in the commons chamber , a campaign they lost .
conservatives have also accused the government of using measures such as shorter hours to kill debate and push through legislation .
what the manifesto said : " prime minister 's questions will be made more effective . "
conclusion : debatable the only change that has been made to prime minister 's questions is to change it from two 15 minute sessions per week to one 30-minute session on wednesdays .
the government says that the longer session leads to a more informed and fairer debate .
the opposition says that there are fewer opportunities to put scrutinise the prime minister .
many outside observers think it 's still the same outdated occasion where the parties sling mud at each other .
what the manifesto said : " ministerial accountability will be reviewed so as to remove recent abuses . "
conclusion : pledge not met critics say that this was an extremely vague commitment .
the best public guide to its completion is the reissued ministerial code .
this document was criticised by the public administration committee for not properly clarifying issues of accountability .
what the manifesto said : " the process for scrutinising european legislation will be overhauled . "
conclusion : partially met the commons agreed in 1998 to widen the scope of european legislation which may be considered by the commons to include documents brought forward under all three pillars of the european union , rather than that brought forward purely through the european commission .
the select committee on european legislation has become the european scrutiny committee and three european standing committees were established .
however , the government also built into this resolution the right to override or expedite scrutiny of legislation in certain circumstances .
what the manifesto said : " the nolan recommendations will be fully implemented and extended to all public bodies . "
conclusion : pledge not met although the government has reiterated its intention to legislate in this area , no formal steps have actually been taken .
a 2001 report by the public administration select committee found that there were ongoing accountability issues with non-departmental bodies .
what the manifesto said : " we will oblige parties to declare the source of all donations above a minimum figure ... "
conclusion : pledge met parties must now declare donations of more than £ 5,000 to their central offices , as well as declaring donations over £ 1,000 to local or constituency parties .
this has not stopped labour 's opponents from pursuing allegations of under-the-counter sleaze against the party as both the bernie ecclestone and lakshmi mittal controversies have shown .
what the manifesto said : " foreign funding -lsb- of political parties -rsb- will be banned . "
conclusion : partially met there are some restrictions under european community law limiting the extent of restriction .
companies registered in another member state but carrying out some business in the uk can still make donations to uk parties .
candidates in northern ireland are exempt from all restrictions .
what the manifesto said : " we are committed to a referendum on the voting system for the house of commons .
an independent commission on voting systems will be appointed early to recommend a proportional alternative to the first-past-the-post system . "
conclusion : pledge not met the jenkins commission produced its report on a new voting system in october 1998 .
the government has not held a referendum on the subject .
what the manifesto said : " we are pledged to a freedom of information act , leading to more open government . "
conclusion : pledge met the freedom of information act received royal assent on 30 november 2000 .
criticisms and qualifications the act will not come into force until 2005 and it has been widely criticised as being as weak .
ministers will still have widespread exemptions from its provisions and some argue that it is actually weaker than the voluntary code introduced by the former conservative prime minister john major .
what the manifesto said : " a sovereign westminster parliament will devolve power to scotland ... and wales . "
conclusion : pledge met the scotland act gained royal assent on 19 november 1998 .
the scottish parliament met for the first time on 12 may 1999 .
the government of wales act was passed in 1998 and the new assembly took up powers in july 1999 .
what the manifesto said : " following a referendum to confirm popular demand , there will be a new deal for london , with a strategic authority and a mayor , each directly elected . "
conclusion : pledge met the directly-elected greater london authority was created in 2000 , under the greater london authority act 1999 .
ken livingstone was elected the first mayor of the city .
what the manifesto said : " demand for directly elected regional government so varies across england that it would be wrong to impose a uniform system .
in time we will introduce legislation to allow the people , region by region , to decide in a referendum whether they want directly elected regional government . "
conclusion : pledge not met while this pledge has not been met within the first five years , the government is expected to shortly propose what it will do .
regional assemblies for england has been hotly debated behind the scenes in whitehall and at westminster .
what the manifesto said : " we will encourage democratic innovations in local government , including pilots of the idea of elected mayors with executive powers in cities . "
conclusion : pledge met the local government act 2000 placed an obligation on councils to take a new structure , either a cabinet style system or a directly elected mayor .
the old committee system has been ditched .
what the manifesto said : " labour is committed to a fair distribution of government grant . "
conclusion : pledge not met labour described this as an ' urgent priority ' for reform .
but it has continued to use the existing grant formulae with no plans to change it before 2003 .
ministers say that a new " fairer and more stable " system will be introduced on 1 april 2003 but there is little detail about how it will work .
what the manifesto said : " councils should not be forced to put their services out to tender , but will be required to obtain best value . "
conclusion : pledge met the local government act 1999 abolished compulsory competitive tendering and introduced " best value " .
councils now have a duty to subject decisions to " the four cs " : competition , challenge , comparison and consultation .
what the manifesto said : " to ensure greater accountability , a proportion of councillors in each locality will be elected annually . "
conclusion : pledge not met metropolitan districts have elections of a third of council seats each year for three out of four years , a system district councils and english shire unitaries can choose to adopt .

this four-year system remains in place for all other council structures -lrb- london boroughs , the gla , welsh and scottish unitaries and as well as a number of district and unitary authorities -rrb- .

some pledges have been omitted for the sake of brevity .
no judgement has been made to the inherent value of the pledge , but important criticisms are included where applicable .
you can choose another policy area below : introducton and explanation economy health education home affairs environment welfare constitution foreign / defence what the manifesto said : " labour will cut costs by removing the internal market .
the savings achieved will go on direct care ... the first £ 100 million saved will treat an extra 100,000 patients " conclusion : pledge met in march 2000 the government announced that this target had been met .
on first coming to office , the figure stood at 1,158,000 .
in march 2000 the list had come down to 1,037,066 , meeting the key election pledge .
the figures for the end of february 2002 was 1,050,400 .
criticisms and qualifications while the government can claim to have met the letter of the pledge , there are many criticisms of how it did so .
ministers struggled for three years to meet the commitment , leading to accusations that clinical priorities were being skewed to meet the target .
the most significant criticism was that the list was being massaged downwards through delays in giving people their first appointment with a consultant - in effect a waiting list to get on the official waiting list .
the government has now adopted waiting times rather than numbers of patients as the key target .
what the manifesto said : " gps and nurses will take the lead in combining together locally to plan local health services more efficiently for all the patients in their area ... "
conclusion : pledge met commissioning pilots were started in 1998 and the network of primary care groups established in april 1999 .
what the manifesto said : " the current system of year-on-year contracts is costly and unstable .
we will introduce three to five year agreements between the local primary care teams and hospitals ... "
conclusion : pledge met the government introduced this change in its white paper ' the new nhs ' , published on 8 december 1997 , saying that the policy change would allow health officials more scope to strategically plan the needs of an area .
what the manifesto said : " hospitals will retain their autonomy over day-to-day administrative functions , but , as part of the nhs , they will be required to meet high-quality standards in the provision of care .
management will be held to account for performance levels . "
conclusion : pledge met hospitals remain responsible for their own administration .
' nhs performance indicators ' -lrb- league tables -rrb- are published .
if the government considers an nhs trust to be failing , it can send in a " hit squad " to overhaul the hospital .
what the manifesto said : " boards will become more representative of the local communities they serve . "
conclusion : pledge met labour complained prior to the 1997 election that hospital boards were being stuffed with tory place men and women .
appointments to hospital boards are no longer made by the secretary of state .
since april 2001 they have been handled by an nhs appointments commission .
criticisms and qualifications critics say that given that up to 1,500 posts come up for renewal every year , labour used the four years between coming to power and the establishment of the new commission to do exactly what the previous administration had done and stuff boards with its own supporters .
what the manifesto said : " a greater proportion of every pound spent will go on patient care not bureaucracy . "
conclusion : debatable there is no single accepted definition of nhs administration costs or bureaucratic load .
the department of health says that it " has no current plans to develop such a definition " and it is arguable whether one could ever be agreed upon by all concerned .
while the parties can argue over whether there is actually more red tape or not , figures in february 2000 revealed that the number of administrators relative to nhs beds had actually increased to an all-time high .
what the manifesto said : " we will raise spending on the nhs in real terms every year ... "
conclusion : pledge met nhs spending in 2002-03 will increase by £ 5.7bn to £ 68.9bn.
this is an annual real increase of 5.7 % up to the end of the current spending round in 2003/04 .
what the manifesto said : " we will end waiting for cancer surgery , thereby helping thousands of women waiting for breast cancer treatment . "
conclusion : pledge not met in march 2002 , a report by the royal college of radiologists found that the number of patients starting radiotherapy within the government target of four weeks of a consultant 's recommendation had fallen in just two years from 68 % to 32 % .
the government accepted the report but said that the number of radiographers had actually increased by 10 % since labour came to power .
what the manifesto said : " a new patients ' charter will concentrate on the quality and success of treatment . "
conclusion : pledge met two reports published in 1998 highlighted the need to make the patients charter more patient focused .
in april 2001 , the government replaced the charter with your guide to the nhs .
there are still patients ' charters in scotland , wales and northern ireland .
what the manifesto said : " as part of our concern to ensure quality , we will work towards the elimination of mixed-sex wards . "
conclusion : pledge not met a bbc survey in november 2001 found that health authorities do not expect to meet target of eliminating 95 % of mixed sex wards by end of 2002 .
what the manifesto said : " health authorities will become the guardians of high standards .
they will monitor services , spread best practice and ensure rising standards of care . "
conclusion : pledge not met while the government has established structures to monitor standards , they are not based on health authorities , as pledged .
criticisms and qualifications however , the government says that its national commission for health improvement -lrb- chi -rrb- , established in 1999 , and the national institute for clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- , share responsibility for spreading best practice .
what the manifesto said : " labour will overcome the problems that have plagued the private finance initiative ... and develop new forms of public / private partnership that work better and protect the interests of the nhs . "
conclusion : debatable the government argues that private money leads to better management and incentives to keep within a deadline and budget .
however , the influential institute for public policy research , says that there is no evidence to support most hospitals built under pfi are scheduled to open in 2004 so it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions yet .
one of the most controversial aspects of labour 's pursuit of pfi is its move towards paying private companies to run hospitals - including responsibility for staff .
what the manifesto said : " a new minister for public health will attack the root causes of ill health , and so improve lives and save the nhs money . "
conclusion : pledge met yvette cooper is the current minister for public health .
her responsibilities health promotion and prevention and tackling inequalities .
what the manifesto said : " labour will set new goals for improving the overall health of the nation which recognise the impact that poverty , poor housing , unemployment and a polluted environment have on health . "
conclusion : pledge met in 1999 , the government published a strategy for public health which included in targets for cutting deaths from cancer , heart disease and stroke , accidents and mental illness .
the document stressed that the government recognized that many of these deaths were linked to social , economic and environmental factors .
what the manifesto said : " labour will establish an independent food standards agency . "
conclusion : pledge met established by an act of parliament in 2000 , the food standards agency aims to protect the public 's health and consumer interests in relation to food and its production .
what the manifesto said : " smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in the uk .
we will therefore ban tobacco advertising . "
conclusion : on course the government introduced a bill to ban tobacco advertising in the 2000-01 session .
it failed to reach the statute book because of the calling of the general election .
the legislation was reintroduced in the lords by the liberal democrats and the government says that it will be given time and support in the commons .
criticisms and qualifications one of the labour government 's few early wobbles came as a consequence of the plan to ban tobacco advertising when the government agreed a highly controversial exception for formula one motor racing .
it then emerged that the head of the sport , bernie ecclestone , had donated £ 1m to labour .
the party subsequently returned the cash after taking advice from public standards watchdog sir patrick neill .

some pledges have been omitted for the sake of brevity .
no judgement has been made to the inherent value of the pledge , but important criticisms are included where applicable .
you can choose another policy area below : " as an initial , self-contained reform , not dependent on further reform in the future , the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the house of lords will be ended ... "
the house of lords act 1999 disqualified all hereditary peers for membership of the house , but allowed 90 hereditary peers and the holders of the offices of earl marshal and lord great chamberlain to say on to ensure there were enough peers to conduct business .
the remaining hereditary peers will be excluded when the much postponed ' second stage ' of lords reform takes place .
" the appointment of life peers to the house of lords will be reviewed .
our objective will be to ensure that , over time , party appointees as life peers more accurately reflect the proportion of votes cast at the previous general election .
we are committed to maintaining an independent cross-bench presence of life peers . "
the government has yet to publish its proposals for completing stage two of lords reform .
a white paper last year came in for criticism and it is expected that legislation will differ from the proposals it made .
while this issue has frustrated the constitutional reform lobby , the government has established a commission to propose non-party peers - though its decisions have been criticised .
" a committee of both houses of parliament will be appointed to undertake a wide-ranging review of possible further change -lsb- in the lords -rsb- and then to bring forward proposals for reform . "
a royal commission , chaired by lord wakeham and including members of both houses , recommended a mix of elected and appointed members .
however , the proposals put forward by the government has been criticised for not bearing any resemblance to the wakeham findings .
" we believe the house of commons is in need of modernisation and we will ask the house to establish a special select committee to review its procedures . "
the modernisation committee first met in june 1997 and made a series of recommendations that led to some changes such as changing the hours of sittings .
for many , however , it has not gone far enough .
a group of labour mps has led a campaigin to make westminster more family-friendly , including a protracted row over whether female mps can breastfeed in the commons chamber , a campaign they lost .
conservatives have also accused the government of using measures such as shorter hours to kill debate and push through legislation .
" prime minister 's questions will be made more effective . "
the only change that has been made to prime minister 's questions is to change it from two 15 minute sessions per week to one 30-minute session on wednesdays .
the government says that the longer session leads to a more informed and fairer debate .
the opposition says that there are fewer opportunities to put scrutinise the prime minister .
many outside observers think it 's still the same outdated occasion where the parties sling mud at each other .
" ministerial accountability will be reviewed so as to remove recent abuses . "
critics say that this was an extremely vague commitment .
the best public guide to its completion is the reissued ministerial code .
this document was criticised by the public administration committee for not properly clarifying issues of accountability .
" the process for scrutinising european legislation will be overhauled . "
the commons agreed in 1998 to widen the scope of european legislation which may be considered by the commons to include documents brought forward under all three pillars of the european union , rather than that brought forward purely through the european commission .
the select committee on european legislation has become the european scrutiny committee and three european standing committees were established .
however , the government also built into this resolution the right to override or expedite scrutiny of legislation in certain circumstances .
" the nolan recommendations will be fully implemented and extended to all public bodies . "
although the government has reiterated its intention to legislate in this area , no formal steps have actually been taken .
a 2001 report by the public administration select committee found that there were ongoing accountability issues with non-departmental bodies .
" we will oblige parties to declare the source of all donations above a minimum figure ... "
parties must now declare donations of more than £ 5,000 to their central offices , as well as declaring donations over £ 1,000 to local or constituency parties .
this has not stopped labour 's opponents from pursuing allegations of under-the-counter sleaze against the party as both the bernie ecclestone and lakshmi mittal controversies have shown .
" foreign funding -lsb- of political parties -rsb- will be banned . "
there are some restrictions under european community law limiting the extent of restriction .
companies registered in another member state but carrying out some business in the uk can still make donations to uk parties .
candidates in northern ireland are exempt from all restrictions .
" we are committed to a referendum on the voting system for the house of commons .
an independent commission on voting systems will be appointed early to recommend a proportional alternative to the first-past-the-post system . "
the jenkins commission produced its report on a new voting system in october 1998 .
the government has not held a referendum on the subject .
" we are pledged to a freedom of information act , leading to more open government . "
the freedom of information act received royal assent on 30 november 2000 .
the act will not come into force until 2005 and it has been widely criticised as being as weak .
ministers will still have widespread exemptions from its provisions and some argue that it is actually weaker than the voluntary code introduced by the former conservative prime minister john major .
" a sovereign westminster parliament will devolve power to scotland ... and wales . "
the scotland act gained royal assent on 19 november 1998 .
the scottish parliament met for the first time on 12 may 1999 .
the government of wales act was passed in 1998 and the new assembly took up powers in july 1999 .
" following a referendum to confirm popular demand , there will be a new deal for london , with a strategic authority and a mayor , each directly elected . "
the directly-elected greater london authority was created in 2000 , under the greater london authority act 1999 .
ken livingstone was elected the first mayor of the city .
" demand for directly elected regional government so varies across england that it would be wrong to impose a uniform system .
in time we will introduce legislation to allow the people , region by region , to decide in a referendum whether they want directly elected regional government . "
while this pledge has not been met within the first five years , the government is expected to shortly propose what it will do .
regional assemblies for england has been hotly debated behind the scenes in whitehall and at westminster .
" we will encourage democratic innovations in local government , including pilots of the idea of elected mayors with executive powers in cities . "
the local government act 2000 placed an obligation on councils to take a new structure , either a cabinet style system or a directly elected mayor .
the old committee system has been ditched .
" labour is committed to a fair distribution of government grant . "
labour described this as an ' urgent priority ' for reform .
but it has continued to use the existing grant formulae with no plans to change it before 2003 .
ministers say that a new " fairer and more stable " system will be introduced on 1 april 2003 but there is little detail about how it will work .
" councils should not be forced to put their services out to tender , but will be required to obtain best value . "
the local government act 1999 abolished compulsory competitive tendering and introduced " best value " .
councils now have a duty to subject decisions to " the four cs " : competition , challenge , comparison and consultation .
" to ensure greater accountability , a proportion of councillors in each locality will be elected annually . "
metropolitan districts have elections of a third of council seats each year for three out of four years , a system district councils and english shire unitaries can choose to adopt .
however , they can also elect to keep the existing system of elections once every four years .
this four-year system remains in place for all other council structures -lrb- london boroughs , the gla , welsh and scottish unitaries and as well as a number of district and unitary authorities -rrb- .
