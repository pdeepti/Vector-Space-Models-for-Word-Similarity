william tierney , who was sacked from his job at camp x-ray last month , says that interrogators have been too lenient and says a british media campaign of political correctness is among the reasons .
he also says that interrogators have been over-sensitive to accusations of harsh treatment .
some of them are too young , he says , and others not well enough schooled in the ways of the middle east and central asia to make any progress in breaking the resolve of the tough al-qaeda fighters they are questioning .
buckets for toilets thin foam mattresses beards shaved clickable guide : inside camp x-ray the pentagon denies the allegations .
officials say mr tierney simply found it difficult to work in a team .
the row came as it was announced that 300 taliban and al-qaeda prisoners at camp x-ray will soon move out of the chain-link cells that prompted an outcry from human rights groups and into more solid structures .
prison camp officials would not say when the captives would be moved into the new camp delta prison , except that it was " imminent . "
the new camp is made up of long rows of cells in sand-coloured buildings that look like elongated mobile homes .
walls separating the cells are metal mesh , so prisoners will be able to see and chat with their immediate neighbours .
but the outer walls are solid .
guards must shackle prisoners who want to go to the toilet each 8-ft -lrb- 2.4 metre -rrb- by 6ft 8-inch -lrb- 2 metre -rrb- cell has a metal bed attached to the wall , a mattress , a low sink with running water and a floor-style toilet that flushes .
the indoor plumbing will ease the burden on the 600 military police guarding the prisoners .
at camp x-ray , they must repeatedly shackle the prisoners and escort them from their cells to portable toilets , except in emergencies when the prisoners use plastic buckets in their cells .
the us does not consider the captives to be prisoners of war under the geneva convention but camp officials said they are honouring the " spirit of geneva " by treating them humanely .
the government has announced plans to try some of them before military tribunals , though it has not said what charges they might face .
hunger strike earlier this month , amnesty international criticised that as a " pick-and-choose approach " amounting to " cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . "
two prisoners who protested at their uncertain fate by refusing to eat for 30 days were force-fed 2,000 calories a day through nasal feeding tubes for 10 days .
they were returned to the prison cells but still are not eating and probably will be taken back to the hospital in a few days for more forced feeding .
the new camp has 408 cells finished and another 204 scheduled to be completed by the end of may , an indication that more prisoners held in afghanistan will be sent to guantanamo .

secretary-general kofi annan made the announcement after talks with an israeli delegation in new york to discuss israel 's objections to the mission 's members and its mandate .
foreign minister shimon peres said that a delay until sunday would give the israeli cabinet the opportunity to discuss the mission before the team arrived . "
there has been some progress but it 's now time to quit it altogether , it 's time to end this " george w bush bbc un correspondent greg barrow says there is an acceptance that without the full co-operation of israel and the palestinian authority that the mission could be undermined .
the mission was originally delayed after israel demanded more counter-terrorism expertise on the mission , but mr annan had seemed prepared to go ahead on the grounds that these demands had been satisfied .
two senior irish policemen with anti-terrorist experience will assist peter fitzgerald , the security official already appointed .
the decision to delay the mission followed increasingly strong calls by us president george w bush for israel to end its incursions into west bank towns .
" there has been some progress but it 's now time to quit it altogether , " he said .
" it 's time to end this . "
israeli forces continued their operation in the west bank with a fresh incursion into the town of qalqilya , but were reported to have left again on friday evening .
they are now said to have taken up position around the town .
earlier , two palestinians were wounded in a gunbattle near the besieged church of the nativity in bethlehem .
however , retracting an earlier statement that it was prepared to use force , the israeli army says its goal is to resolve the siege peacefully , to release the people inside arrest those who are wanted without harming the church .
in ramallah , where palestinian leader yasser arafat remains confined to his headquarters , israeli troops reportedly fired tear gas on several hundred demonstrators demanding mr arafat 's release .
' no reason for delay ' the office of israeli prime minister ariel sharon said the un mission 's brief was not compatible with the mandate of the security council and it asked for further discussions in new york .
mr annan initially resisted any further delay , but later agreed to a request for a postponement from israeli foreign minister shimon peres .
the un has been insisting its mission should go ahead as planned this weekend , after it agreed to add two military experts to the team in response to an earlier israeli request .
israel said the team was unbalanced and its scope needed clarification before it can begin its work .
israeli conditions israeli government spokesman avi pazner said earlier that he expected the un mission to investigate " terrorist activity " and guarantee immunity for israeli soldiers .
israeli radio says the immunity is necessary to protect army personnel who testify to the un team from any subsequent criminal prosecutions .
the radio said israel wanted the un mission to meet victims of palestinian suicide attacks .
israel is also pushing for the right for both sides to review the un team 's report before it is presented to mr annan , according to the radio .
the israelis say their incursion in jenin earlier in april was part of their military operation to destroy " terrorist cells " .
the palestinians have accused israel of a massacre and allege war crimes were committed during the eight-day occupation of the camp .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- plane-spotters warned over appeal categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 27 april , 2002 , 05:32 gmt 06:32 uk plane-spotters warned over appeal the group were stunned by the verdicts the british plane-spotters found guilty of spy charges in greece have been warned they are unlikely to clear their names through the greek courts .
human rights lawyer stephen jakobi , of fair trials abroad , said he believed the only option open to them now was to take their case to the european courts .
his advice comes as the 12 plane-spotters are due to arrive back in england , less than 24 hours after six of them - and two dutchmen - were found guilty of espionage at a military air show .
the eight were sentenced to three years in prison , but were told they could go home pending their appeal .
the remaining six britons were found guilty of aiding and abetting and were given sentences of one year each , suspended for three years .
' expensive ' the 12 britons are due to fly back to luton airport on saturday morning , but all have vowed to return to greece to clear their names .
peter norris , one of the convicted spotters , was comforted by his wife perdita but mr jakobi warned them they should effectively write off an appeal in greece , and instead concentrate on the european courts .
" i do n't believe there is a cat in hell 's chance of getting anywhere in the greek courts , " he said .
" i see only one reason for going back , which is to spend as little money as possible on getting the appeal turned down , which is what will happen , before taking it to europe . "
the main problem for the plane-spotters was that they could not now afford to conduct an expensive appeal which would inevitably fail , mr jakobi added .
' disproportionate ' if the group was to go back to greece to fight the sentences and face the possibility of jail , then the government should provide some sort of help , he said .
foreign secretary jack straw said on friday evening he was " shocked " by the scale of the sentences .
he was relieved the plane-spotters were being allowed home - for the time being - and stressed he and his staff would continue to offer them support .
downing street said the prime minister tony blair believed the case had been " disproportionate " and had discussed it with his greek counterpart , costas simitis .
national security all the members of the group had denied the espionage charges , which carry a maximum penalty of five years in jail or a hefty fine .
they were arrested at an air show in kalamata , southern greece , last november , and charged with taking pictures in a military zone .
the plane-spotters insisted they were at the show on the invitation of the greek authorities and that any information collected was already freely available .
but greek prosecutors told the court in kalamata they knew what they were doing was illegal and could compromise the country 's national security .
they spent five weeks in prison before being released on 14 dec after posting bail of Â£ 9,000 each .
originally they faced a felony charge of spying , which carries a 20-year sentence , but this was later downgraded to misdemeanour charges .

human rights lawyer stephen jakobi , of fair trials abroad , said he believed the only option open to them now was to take their case to the european courts .
his advice comes as the 12 plane-spotters are due to arrive back in england , less than 24 hours after six of them - and two dutchmen - were found guilty of espionage at a military air show .
the eight were sentenced to three years in prison , but were told they could go home pending their appeal .
the remaining six britons were found guilty of aiding and abetting and were given sentences of one year each , suspended for three years .
' expensive ' the 12 britons are due to fly back to luton airport on saturday morning , but all have vowed to return to greece to clear their names .
but mr jakobi warned them they should effectively write off an appeal in greece , and instead concentrate on the european courts .
" i do n't believe there is a cat in hell 's chance of getting anywhere in the greek courts , " he said .
" i see only one reason for going back , which is to spend as little money as possible on getting the appeal turned down , which is what will happen , before taking it to europe . "
the main problem for the plane-spotters was that they could not now afford to conduct an expensive appeal which would inevitably fail , mr jakobi added .
' disproportionate ' if the group was to go back to greece to fight the sentences and face the possibility of jail , then the government should provide some sort of help , he said .
foreign secretary jack straw said on friday evening he was " shocked " by the scale of the sentences .
he was relieved the plane-spotters were being allowed home - for the time being - and stressed he and his staff would continue to offer them support .
downing street said the prime minister tony blair believed the case had been " disproportionate " and had discussed it with his greek counterpart , costas simitis .
national security all the members of the group had denied the espionage charges , which carry a maximum penalty of five years in jail or a hefty fine .
they were arrested at an air show in kalamata , southern greece , last november , and charged with taking pictures in a military zone .
the plane-spotters insisted they were at the show on the invitation of the greek authorities and that any information collected was already freely available .
but greek prosecutors told the court in kalamata they knew what they were doing was illegal and could compromise the country 's national security .
they spent five weeks in prison before being released on 14 dec after posting bail of Â£ 9,000 each .
originally they faced a felony charge of spying , which carries a 20-year sentence , but this was later downgraded to misdemeanour charges .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- gm safety tests ' flawed ' categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 27 april , 2002 , 10:17 gmt 11:17 uk gm safety tests ' flawed ' protesters have often uprooted gm crops safety tests on genetically modified maize -lrb- corn -rrb- currently growing in britain were flawed , it has emerged .
the crop , t-25 gm maize , was tested in laboratory experiments on chickens .
during the tests , twice as many chickens died when fed on t-25 gm maize , compared with those fed on conventional maize .
this research was apparently overlooked when the crop was given marketing approval in 1996 .
acre - the advisory committee on releases to the environment - granted approval for the commercial use of t-25 .
the tests were no good enough to base a student project on , let alone a marketing consent for a gm product dr stephen keston but , following an investigation by bbc radio 4 's farming today programme , acre 's chairman lord alan gray admitted he believed the research should have been re-analysed and that safety tests were not good enough to give a true picture of the risks involved .
t-25 was first approved by the french authorities , then the rest of europe in 1996 - but it was only when it reached the seed listing stage that doubts began to be raised .
t-25 gm maize is being grown throughout the uk as part of the government 's field crop trials and is intended to be used as cattle feed .
dr stephen keston , a senior researcher at the department of veterinary sciences at bristol veterinary school , studied the initial tests .
' thin science ' he said they were " not really good enough to base a student project on , let alone a marketing consent for a gm product " .
" it does surprise me that we have got so far down the line of licensing a gm crop apparently based on very weak and thin science , " he said .
when the marketing consent was granted there were only two animal studies relating to t-25 available to the approval committees - one on rats and one on chickens - and both have subsequently been criticised by independent scientists .
dr gray was on the committee that gave the original consent .
he said advice given to the panel from its experts had initially said there was " nothing in any of the data they looked at which made them believe there was a risk to the animals , humans and the environment from feeding this product " .
fears but he admitted it might have been better to re-analyse the chicken feeding tests , given the doubts raised .
peter ainsworth , shadow secretary of state for the department for environment -lrb- defra -rrb- is calling for an overhaul of the whole approvals process for gm crops .
in january , the government announced 44 more sites across the country would be used for farm trials of genetically modified oilseed rape and beet .
campaigners , including friends of the earth , have long argued against the trials and expressed fears about safety .
several times trial fields have been taken over by protesters who have uprooted the experimental plants in order to prevent what they describe as contamination of other crops and wild species .
