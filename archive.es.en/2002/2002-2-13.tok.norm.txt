british-born sheikh omar was arrested on monday " unless we discover firm evidence about what has happened to daniel , i would say it is unclear -lsb- if he is still alive -rsb- , " syed kamal shah , police chief in the southern province of sindh , told reuters .
mr pearl , a reporter for the wall street journal , disappeared last month in karachi while investigating islamic militants .
the arrest of sheikh omar is being seen as the biggest breakthrough in the three-week-old investigation and could reveal whether mr pearl is alive - or whether he has been executed , as earlier threatened by the kidnappers .
investigating authorities believe sheikh omar , 27 , who was implicated by other captured suspects , is linked to the banned militant group , jaish-e-mohammed .
a british-born islamic militant , he had been imprisoned in india on charges of kidnapping four tourists and released in a hostage exchange deal in 1999 .
three men , arrested for helping to send e-mails including photographs of the kidnapped 38-year-old south asia bureau chief , told police they were following sheikh omar 's orders .
on tuesday , the three were remanded in custody for a further 14 days by a judge in karachi .
they arrived at the high-security trial handcuffed and chained together , with their faces covered by blankets and towels .
several more arrests were reported in karachi , rawalpindi and other major cities .
daniel pearl wanted to interview islamic militants jamil yousuf , head of a citizens ' police liaison committee that is involved with the investigation , said the key break in sheikh omar 's arrest came on monday night with the arrest of a suspect in islamabad who gave key information .

the commons modernisation committee says chairmen of the select committees , who can call ministers to account for their actions , should be paid for the extra work .
main proposals senior mps paid for leading scrutiny work whips to lose final say on who sits on select committees more staff for scrutiny new checks on departments ' financial accounts despite speculation the chairmen could see their salaries rise by around £ 27,000 to £ 78,000 , the committee says it has not discussed any figures at all and that the amounts would be " modest " .
the changes are aimed at creating an alternative career structure for the many mps who are not on the ministerial ladder .
the cross-party committee also proposes giving select committees more staff , as well as defining their remits more clearly .
the reform plans follow the outcry sparked in parliament last year when labour whips tried to replace gwyneth dunwoody and donald anderson as select committee chairmen .
whips to lose control after a humiliating defeat on the issue , the government promised it would change the way mps scrutinised ministers ' work .
under the plans from the modernisation committee , chaired by commons leader robin cook , party whips would be stripped of the final say over who sits on select committees .
instead , a new nominations committee would be created , itself selected by senior mps chosen by the speaker .
the new committee would be able to accept and reject nominations from each party to the select committees , which under the plans would be renamed " scrutiny committees " .
select committee chairman are currently not paid for their extra duties .
the new salaries are designed to stop backbenchers leaving committees to pursue government ambitions .
liberal democrat chief whip paul tyler , a member of the modernisation committee , said mps sometimes left to become " junior whip in charge of bottle washing " as the first rung on the ministerial ladder .
but mr tyler admitted he had " misgivings " about the salary proposal .
' modest ' pay hikes if the commons approves the idea , the new salaries would be set by the independent senior salaries review board .
despite that caveat , mr cook said the pay hikes were likely to be " modest " .
the new plans also try to define the remits of select committees around " core tasks " , including the new role of examining the financial accounts of government departments .
they would also look at appointments made by ministers to executive agencies outside of government .
the committees would have bigger workloads but would also get more staff , including people seconded from the national audit office .
mr cook wants the changes put in place during this parliament , although many of the plans will have little effect until the wholesale reappointment of select committees after the next election .
earlier , mrs dunwoody , chairman of the commons transport select committee , told bbc radio 4 's today programme it was not a good idea to pay committee chairmen .
" that would soon make the post part of the sinecure and part of this theory that if you get somebody locked into government in some way then of course they are never going to argue , " she said .
questions under scrutiny publication of proposals coincides with a move from former labour whip graham allen to make questions to ministers in the commons more topical and timely .
mps currently have to give two weeks notice of their question , although they can ask a supplementary query on the same topic .
when he appears before the commons procedure committee on tuesday , mr allen will press for that notice period to be abandoned .
that would both make questions more topical and make ministers defend general policy on their feet rather than " waste weeks " of civil service time on preparing for questions that were never asked , he argued .
simon woolley , from campaign group operation black vote , welcomed any attempts to reform parliament 's " archaic " practices .
but people would only become more engaged in politics if parliament better reflected the make up of british society , mr woolley told the today programme .

pro-hunt campaigners deny that the hunt is cruel , saying that it is a practical and useful method of controlling the fox population .
it is estimated that there are 23,000 foxes in scotland , although it is difficult to know for sure .
however , it is indisputable that foxes are wild predators that eat rabbits , hares , mice , poultry and small lambs .
the extent of the damage done by foxes is a matter which is contested .
countryside campaigners support mounted fox hunts as a method of controlling the number of foxes .
the mounted hunt involves foxes being chased by a pack of hounds and a group of huntsmen and women on horseback for several hours .
the hounds follow the fox until it is driven into hiding , killed by the dogs or escapes .
hunt supporters do not believe this is a cruel sport .
the fox does not anticipate death and is not unduly traumatised by the pursuit , they say .
and they add that the fox is often killed by a " quick nip " to the back of the head , which they allege kills it outright .
hunting , they say , not only kills one fox , but disperses others .
the alternatives - shooting , gassing , snaring or poisoning - would all inflict much more pain and suffering on the foxes , according to hunt supporters .
other arguments used by pro-hunt campaigners include the defence of countryside traditions and the number of people employed either directly or indirectly in the fox hunts .
the south of scotland , which has the majority of the country 's 10 mounted hunts , would be worst affected by a hunt ban .
animal welfare campaigners say fox hunting is cruel and unnecessary .
they point to the fact that the fox has no natural predators except man , and is therefore not accustomed to being chased .
they say that if , and only if , there is a specific problem with a fox in one area , then shooting by a marksman is the only humane way to deal with the problem .
and they do not accept the country sport lobby 's stance that foxes are pests , and need to be destroyed somehow .
they reject claims of a quick , clean death for the fox and say that killing wild animals for pleasure should not be acceptable in this day and age .
