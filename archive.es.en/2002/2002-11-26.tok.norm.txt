yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .
edmund stoiber , the conservative chancellor candidate who narrowly lost to schröder , is confident voters will punish the government in the hesse and lower saxony state elections in february .
" the head of government has become a laughable number one in the hit parade as an electoral fraudster and hiker of taxes , " he said .
reforms watered down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , chairman of the commission to reform the labor market , has fiercely criticized the government 's backtracking over his proposals .
and there are harsh words too from those whose expertise was called upon to come up with proposals aimed at kickstarting germany 's economy .
peter hartz , for example , the volkswagen manager whose labor reform commission focused on halving unemployment , has vehemently attacked the government for backtracking and caving in to union demands .
" the way the plans look now , it will certainly not be possible to create jobs for two million people , " he told the news magazine der spiegel .
" important parts of our concept are missing from the legislation , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.11.2002 germany 's free democrats want möllemann out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen möllemann is unlikely to leave the free democrats without a fight .
the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .
haider would be orthodox communist if it helped him to get to power . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .
jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .
conservatives win big in austrian election austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .

yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .
edmund stoiber , the conservative chancellor candidate who narrowly lost to schröder , is confident voters will punish the government in the hesse and lower saxony state elections in february .
" the head of government has become a laughable number one in the hit parade as an electoral fraudster and hiker of taxes , " he said .
reforms watered down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , chairman of the commission to reform the labor market , has fiercely criticized the government 's backtracking over his proposals .
and there are harsh words too from those whose expertise was called upon to come up with proposals aimed at kickstarting germany 's economy .
peter hartz , for example , the volkswagen manager whose labor reform commission focused on halving unemployment , has vehemently attacked the government for backtracking and caving in to union demands .
" the way the plans look now , it will certainly not be possible to create jobs for two million people , " he told the news magazine der spiegel .
" important parts of our concept are missing from the legislation , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.11.2002 desperately seeking schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has every right to look worried as he contemplates his future the german public wants strong leadership in these awkward times for the country .
yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .
edmund stoiber , the conservative chancellor candidate who narrowly lost to schröder , is confident voters will punish the government in the hesse and lower saxony state elections in february .
" the head of government has become a laughable number one in the hit parade as an electoral fraudster and hiker of taxes , " he said .
reforms watered down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , chairman of the commission to reform the labor market , has fiercely criticized the government 's backtracking over his proposals .
and there are harsh words too from those whose expertise was called upon to come up with proposals aimed at kickstarting germany 's economy .
peter hartz , for example , the volkswagen manager whose labor reform commission focused on halving unemployment , has vehemently attacked the government for backtracking and caving in to union demands .
" the way the plans look now , it will certainly not be possible to create jobs for two million people , " he told the news magazine der spiegel .
" important parts of our concept are missing from the legislation , " he said .
how and whether schröder will bounce back is anyone 's guess .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .
haider would be orthodox communist if it helped him to get to power . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.11.2002 desperately seeking schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has every right to look worried as he contemplates his future the german public wants strong leadership in these awkward times for the country .
yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .
edmund stoiber , the conservative chancellor candidate who narrowly lost to schröder , is confident voters will punish the government in the hesse and lower saxony state elections in february .
" the head of government has become a laughable number one in the hit parade as an electoral fraudster and hiker of taxes , " he said .
reforms watered down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , chairman of the commission to reform the labor market , has fiercely criticized the government 's backtracking over his proposals .
and there are harsh words too from those whose expertise was called upon to come up with proposals aimed at kickstarting germany 's economy .
peter hartz , for example , the volkswagen manager whose labor reform commission focused on halving unemployment , has vehemently attacked the government for backtracking and caving in to union demands .
" the way the plans look now , it will certainly not be possible to create jobs for two million people , " he told the news magazine der spiegel .
" important parts of our concept are missing from the legislation , " he said .
how and whether schröder will bounce back is anyone 's guess .
a political talk-show guest recently likened him to a surfer waiting for that special wave .
" either he rides that wave or it pulls him under , " the pundit said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's winter of discontent looms large businesses and financial institutions are preparing for the german economy to fall into a recession .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .
haider would be orthodox communist if it helped him to get to power . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .
jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .
conservatives win big in austrian election austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear .

the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .
damaging maneuvers in their report , fdp leaders said that möllemann had tried to maneuver the party " into the murky waters of the political fringe , " a reference to the pre-election campaign brochure in which he attacked sharon and michel friedman , vice-president of the central council of jews in germany .
the fdp 's poor showing in the september election , in which they only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote having aimed for 18 percent , is largely attributed to the brochure campaign accusing friedman of inciting anti-semitism .

deputy chairman walter döring told the party to expect a " mudslinging match . "

the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .
damaging maneuvers in their report , fdp leaders said that möllemann had tried to maneuver the party " into the murky waters of the political fringe , " a reference to the pre-election campaign brochure in which he attacked sharon and michel friedman , vice-president of the central council of jews in germany .
the fdp 's poor showing in the september election , in which they only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote having aimed for 18 percent , is largely attributed to the brochure campaign accusing friedman of inciting anti-semitism .
seperately , möllemann is facing a criminal investigation in his home state on suspicion of violating party funding law .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament .
möllemann vows to fight but möllemann would not be möllemann if he did not come out fighting against the leadership 's decision .
" i would never in my wildest dreams have believed that the liberal party of law and order , the fdp , could have given me a political trial without hearing my testimony , " he said in a magazine interview to be released later this week .
and möllemann 's colleagues believe möllemann will put up a fight to the bitter end .
deputy chairman walter döring told the party to expect a " mudslinging match . "
birgit homburger , deputy chairwoman of the fdp 's parliamentary group , warned of a protracted affair : with a personality like möllemann you have to expect that he will inflict further damage on the party . "
" no other option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle will be hoping to exorcise the party 's ill-fated 18 percent campaign with möllemann 's expulsion .
guido westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- , the fdp 's youthful leader who some say covertly supported möllemann 's dogmatic approach in trying to put the party into the spotlight , is convinced that möllemann 's expulsion will be successful .
" the facts are clear , " he said , adding , " there is no other option . "
the case for möllemann 's expulsion will be put to an arbitration panel appointed by the party .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.11.2002 desperately seeking schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has every right to look worried as he contemplates his future the german public wants strong leadership in these awkward times for the country .
yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .

yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .
haider would be orthodox communist if it helped him to get to power . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .
jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .
conservatives win big in austrian election austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear .

the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .
damaging maneuvers in their report , fdp leaders said that möllemann had tried to maneuver the party " into the murky waters of the political fringe , " a reference to the pre-election campaign brochure in which he attacked sharon and michel friedman , vice-president of the central council of jews in germany .
the fdp 's poor showing in the september election , in which they only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote having aimed for 18 percent , is largely attributed to the brochure campaign accusing friedman of inciting anti-semitism .
seperately , möllemann is facing a criminal investigation in his home state on suspicion of violating party funding law .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament .
möllemann vows to fight but möllemann would not be möllemann if he did not come out fighting against the leadership 's decision .
" i would never in my wildest dreams have believed that the liberal party of law and order , the fdp , could have given me a political trial without hearing my testimony , " he said in a magazine interview to be released later this week .
and möllemann 's colleagues believe möllemann will put up a fight to the bitter end .
deputy chairman walter döring told the party to expect a " mudslinging match . "
birgit homburger , deputy chairwoman of the fdp 's parliamentary group , warned of a protracted affair : with a personality like möllemann you have to expect that he will inflict further damage on the party . "
" no other option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle will be hoping to exorcise the party 's ill-fated 18 percent campaign with möllemann 's expulsion .
guido westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- , the fdp 's youthful leader who some say covertly supported möllemann 's dogmatic approach in trying to put the party into the spotlight , is convinced that möllemann 's expulsion will be successful .
" the facts are clear , " he said , adding , " there is no other option . "

the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .
damaging maneuvers in their report , fdp leaders said that möllemann had tried to maneuver the party " into the murky waters of the political fringe , " a reference to the pre-election campaign brochure in which he attacked sharon and michel friedman , vice-president of the central council of jews in germany .
the fdp 's poor showing in the september election , in which they only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote having aimed for 18 percent , is largely attributed to the brochure campaign accusing friedman of inciting anti-semitism .
seperately , möllemann is facing a criminal investigation in his home state on suspicion of violating party funding law .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament .
möllemann vows to fight but möllemann would not be möllemann if he did not come out fighting against the leadership 's decision .
" i would never in my wildest dreams have believed that the liberal party of law and order , the fdp , could have given me a political trial without hearing my testimony , " he said in a magazine interview to be released later this week .
and möllemann 's colleagues believe möllemann will put up a fight to the bitter end .
deputy chairman walter döring told the party to expect a " mudslinging match . "
birgit homburger , deputy chairwoman of the fdp 's parliamentary group , warned of a protracted affair : with a personality like möllemann you have to expect that he will inflict further damage on the party . "
" no other option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle will be hoping to exorcise the party 's ill-fated 18 percent campaign with möllemann 's expulsion .
guido westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- , the fdp 's youthful leader who some say covertly supported möllemann 's dogmatic approach in trying to put the party into the spotlight , is convinced that möllemann 's expulsion will be successful .
" the facts are clear , " he said , adding , " there is no other option . "
the case for möllemann 's expulsion will be put to an arbitration panel appointed by the party .
the party leadership said it would launch proceedings on december 9 should möllemann not quit voluntarily . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new anti-semitism flap tarnishes fdp leader a senior leader of the liberal free democrats is back in the headlines for taunting israeli prime minister ariel sharon and the head of germany ’ s biggest jewish organization in a campaign flyer .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !

variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .

when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .

the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .
damaging maneuvers in their report , fdp leaders said that möllemann had tried to maneuver the party " into the murky waters of the political fringe , " a reference to the pre-election campaign brochure in which he attacked sharon and michel friedman , vice-president of the central council of jews in germany .
the fdp 's poor showing in the september election , in which they only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote having aimed for 18 percent , is largely attributed to the brochure campaign accusing friedman of inciting anti-semitism .
seperately , möllemann is facing a criminal investigation in his home state on suspicion of violating party funding law .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament .
möllemann vows to fight but möllemann would not be möllemann if he did not come out fighting against the leadership 's decision .
" i would never in my wildest dreams have believed that the liberal party of law and order , the fdp , could have given me a political trial without hearing my testimony , " he said in a magazine interview to be released later this week .
and möllemann 's colleagues believe möllemann will put up a fight to the bitter end .
deputy chairman walter döring told the party to expect a " mudslinging match . "
birgit homburger , deputy chairwoman of the fdp 's parliamentary group , warned of a protracted affair : with a personality like möllemann you have to expect that he will inflict further damage on the party . "
" no other option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle will be hoping to exorcise the party 's ill-fated 18 percent campaign with möllemann 's expulsion .
guido westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- , the fdp 's youthful leader who some say covertly supported möllemann 's dogmatic approach in trying to put the party into the spotlight , is convinced that möllemann 's expulsion will be successful .
" the facts are clear , " he said , adding , " there is no other option . "
the case for möllemann 's expulsion will be put to an arbitration panel appointed by the party .

yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .
edmund stoiber , the conservative chancellor candidate who narrowly lost to schröder , is confident voters will punish the government in the hesse and lower saxony state elections in february .
" the head of government has become a laughable number one in the hit parade as an electoral fraudster and hiker of taxes , " he said .
reforms watered down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , chairman of the commission to reform the labor market , has fiercely criticized the government 's backtracking over his proposals .
and there are harsh words too from those whose expertise was called upon to come up with proposals aimed at kickstarting germany 's economy .
peter hartz , for example , the volkswagen manager whose labor reform commission focused on halving unemployment , has vehemently attacked the government for backtracking and caving in to union demands .
" the way the plans look now , it will certainly not be possible to create jobs for two million people , " he told the news magazine der spiegel .
" important parts of our concept are missing from the legislation , " he said .

yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.11.2002 desperately seeking schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has every right to look worried as he contemplates his future the german public wants strong leadership in these awkward times for the country .
yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .
edmund stoiber , the conservative chancellor candidate who narrowly lost to schröder , is confident voters will punish the government in the hesse and lower saxony state elections in february .
" the head of government has become a laughable number one in the hit parade as an electoral fraudster and hiker of taxes , " he said .
reforms watered down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , chairman of the commission to reform the labor market , has fiercely criticized the government 's backtracking over his proposals .
and there are harsh words too from those whose expertise was called upon to come up with proposals aimed at kickstarting germany 's economy .
peter hartz , for example , the volkswagen manager whose labor reform commission focused on halving unemployment , has vehemently attacked the government for backtracking and caving in to union demands .
" the way the plans look now , it will certainly not be possible to create jobs for two million people , " he told the news magazine der spiegel .
" important parts of our concept are missing from the legislation , " he said .
how and whether schröder will bounce back is anyone 's guess .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .
haider would be orthodox communist if it helped him to get to power . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .
haider would be orthodox communist if it helped him to get to power . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .
jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .

the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .
damaging maneuvers in their report , fdp leaders said that möllemann had tried to maneuver the party " into the murky waters of the political fringe , " a reference to the pre-election campaign brochure in which he attacked sharon and michel friedman , vice-president of the central council of jews in germany .
the fdp 's poor showing in the september election , in which they only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote having aimed for 18 percent , is largely attributed to the brochure campaign accusing friedman of inciting anti-semitism .
seperately , möllemann is facing a criminal investigation in his home state on suspicion of violating party funding law .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament .
möllemann vows to fight but möllemann would not be möllemann if he did not come out fighting against the leadership 's decision .
" i would never in my wildest dreams have believed that the liberal party of law and order , the fdp , could have given me a political trial without hearing my testimony , " he said in a magazine interview to be released later this week .
and möllemann 's colleagues believe möllemann will put up a fight to the bitter end .
deputy chairman walter döring told the party to expect a " mudslinging match . "
birgit homburger , deputy chairwoman of the fdp 's parliamentary group , warned of a protracted affair : with a personality like möllemann you have to expect that he will inflict further damage on the party . "
" no other option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle will be hoping to exorcise the party 's ill-fated 18 percent campaign with möllemann 's expulsion .
guido westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- , the fdp 's youthful leader who some say covertly supported möllemann 's dogmatic approach in trying to put the party into the spotlight , is convinced that möllemann 's expulsion will be successful .
" the facts are clear , " he said , adding , " there is no other option . "
the case for möllemann 's expulsion will be put to an arbitration panel appointed by the party .

the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .
damaging maneuvers in their report , fdp leaders said that möllemann had tried to maneuver the party " into the murky waters of the political fringe , " a reference to the pre-election campaign brochure in which he attacked sharon and michel friedman , vice-president of the central council of jews in germany .
the fdp 's poor showing in the september election , in which they only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote having aimed for 18 percent , is largely attributed to the brochure campaign accusing friedman of inciting anti-semitism .
seperately , möllemann is facing a criminal investigation in his home state on suspicion of violating party funding law .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament .
möllemann vows to fight but möllemann would not be möllemann if he did not come out fighting against the leadership 's decision .
" i would never in my wildest dreams have believed that the liberal party of law and order , the fdp , could have given me a political trial without hearing my testimony , " he said in a magazine interview to be released later this week .
and möllemann 's colleagues believe möllemann will put up a fight to the bitter end .
deputy chairman walter döring told the party to expect a " mudslinging match . "
birgit homburger , deputy chairwoman of the fdp 's parliamentary group , warned of a protracted affair : with a personality like möllemann you have to expect that he will inflict further damage on the party . "

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .
haider would be orthodox communist if it helped him to get to power . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .
jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .
conservatives win big in austrian election austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear .

during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .
haider would be orthodox communist if it helped him to get to power . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .
jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .
conservatives win big in austrian election austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear .

the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .
damaging maneuvers in their report , fdp leaders said that möllemann had tried to maneuver the party " into the murky waters of the political fringe , " a reference to the pre-election campaign brochure in which he attacked sharon and michel friedman , vice-president of the central council of jews in germany .
the fdp 's poor showing in the september election , in which they only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote having aimed for 18 percent , is largely attributed to the brochure campaign accusing friedman of inciting anti-semitism .
seperately , möllemann is facing a criminal investigation in his home state on suspicion of violating party funding law .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament .
möllemann vows to fight but möllemann would not be möllemann if he did not come out fighting against the leadership 's decision .
" i would never in my wildest dreams have believed that the liberal party of law and order , the fdp , could have given me a political trial without hearing my testimony , " he said in a magazine interview to be released later this week .
and möllemann 's colleagues believe möllemann will put up a fight to the bitter end .
deputy chairman walter döring told the party to expect a " mudslinging match . "
birgit homburger , deputy chairwoman of the fdp 's parliamentary group , warned of a protracted affair : with a personality like möllemann you have to expect that he will inflict further damage on the party . "
" no other option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle will be hoping to exorcise the party 's ill-fated 18 percent campaign with möllemann 's expulsion .
guido westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- , the fdp 's youthful leader who some say covertly supported möllemann 's dogmatic approach in trying to put the party into the spotlight , is convinced that möllemann 's expulsion will be successful .
" the facts are clear , " he said , adding , " there is no other option . "
the case for möllemann 's expulsion will be put to an arbitration panel appointed by the party .

in western germany , the business climate index fell from 87.7 to 87.3 points , the lowest level since january .
however , the decline was less severe than many economists expected .
according to the ifo survey , which polled more than 7,000 businesses through germany , november ’ s bad mood can be traced to gloom over prospects for the next few months .
the index of overall german business confidence fell from 97.9 to 95.8 points .
pessimism is especially apparent in the construction , manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors , while the retail sector expressed slightly more confidence . more briefs 26.11.2002 -pipe- allianz group lowers profit sharing rates 25.11.2002 -pipe- former thyssen ceo to run mobilcom 25.11.2002 -pipe- strikes in france force lufthansa to cancel flights 25.11.2002 -pipe- head of europe ’ s largest baking group steps down 22.11.2002 -pipe- comroad scales down figures after boss ’ s conviction 22.11.2002 -pipe- commerzbank sells u.s. subsidiary 22.11.2002 -pipe- mobilcom avoids bankruptcy with deal 22.11.2002 -pipe- buch.de closes in on amazon radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.11.2002 desperately seeking schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has every right to look worried as he contemplates his future the german public wants strong leadership in these awkward times for the country .
yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .
edmund stoiber , the conservative chancellor candidate who narrowly lost to schröder , is confident voters will punish the government in the hesse and lower saxony state elections in february .
" the head of government has become a laughable number one in the hit parade as an electoral fraudster and hiker of taxes , " he said .
reforms watered down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , chairman of the commission to reform the labor market , has fiercely criticized the government 's backtracking over his proposals .
and there are harsh words too from those whose expertise was called upon to come up with proposals aimed at kickstarting germany 's economy .
peter hartz , for example , the volkswagen manager whose labor reform commission focused on halving unemployment , has vehemently attacked the government for backtracking and caving in to union demands .
" the way the plans look now , it will certainly not be possible to create jobs for two million people , " he told the news magazine der spiegel .
" important parts of our concept are missing from the legislation , " he said .
how and whether schröder will bounce back is anyone 's guess .

yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .
edmund stoiber , the conservative chancellor candidate who narrowly lost to schröder , is confident voters will punish the government in the hesse and lower saxony state elections in february .
" the head of government has become a laughable number one in the hit parade as an electoral fraudster and hiker of taxes , " he said .
reforms watered down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , chairman of the commission to reform the labor market , has fiercely criticized the government 's backtracking over his proposals .
and there are harsh words too from those whose expertise was called upon to come up with proposals aimed at kickstarting germany 's economy .
peter hartz , for example , the volkswagen manager whose labor reform commission focused on halving unemployment , has vehemently attacked the government for backtracking and caving in to union demands .
" the way the plans look now , it will certainly not be possible to create jobs for two million people , " he told the news magazine der spiegel .
" important parts of our concept are missing from the legislation , " he said .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .

the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .
damaging maneuvers in their report , fdp leaders said that möllemann had tried to maneuver the party " into the murky waters of the political fringe , " a reference to the pre-election campaign brochure in which he attacked sharon and michel friedman , vice-president of the central council of jews in germany .
the fdp 's poor showing in the september election , in which they only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote having aimed for 18 percent , is largely attributed to the brochure campaign accusing friedman of inciting anti-semitism .
seperately , möllemann is facing a criminal investigation in his home state on suspicion of violating party funding law .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament .
möllemann vows to fight but möllemann would not be möllemann if he did not come out fighting against the leadership 's decision .
" i would never in my wildest dreams have believed that the liberal party of law and order , the fdp , could have given me a political trial without hearing my testimony , " he said in a magazine interview to be released later this week .
and möllemann 's colleagues believe möllemann will put up a fight to the bitter end .
deputy chairman walter döring told the party to expect a " mudslinging match . "
birgit homburger , deputy chairwoman of the fdp 's parliamentary group , warned of a protracted affair : with a personality like möllemann you have to expect that he will inflict further damage on the party . "
" no other option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle will be hoping to exorcise the party 's ill-fated 18 percent campaign with möllemann 's expulsion .
guido westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- , the fdp 's youthful leader who some say covertly supported möllemann 's dogmatic approach in trying to put the party into the spotlight , is convinced that möllemann 's expulsion will be successful .
" the facts are clear , " he said , adding , " there is no other option . "
the case for möllemann 's expulsion will be put to an arbitration panel appointed by the party .
the party leadership said it would launch proceedings on december 9 should möllemann not quit voluntarily . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new anti-semitism flap tarnishes fdp leader a senior leader of the liberal free democrats is back in the headlines for taunting israeli prime minister ariel sharon and the head of germany ’ s biggest jewish organization in a campaign flyer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.11.2002 desperately seeking schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has every right to look worried as he contemplates his future the german public wants strong leadership in these awkward times for the country .
yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .
edmund stoiber , the conservative chancellor candidate who narrowly lost to schröder , is confident voters will punish the government in the hesse and lower saxony state elections in february .
" the head of government has become a laughable number one in the hit parade as an electoral fraudster and hiker of taxes , " he said .
reforms watered down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , chairman of the commission to reform the labor market , has fiercely criticized the government 's backtracking over his proposals .
and there are harsh words too from those whose expertise was called upon to come up with proposals aimed at kickstarting germany 's economy .
peter hartz , for example , the volkswagen manager whose labor reform commission focused on halving unemployment , has vehemently attacked the government for backtracking and caving in to union demands .
" the way the plans look now , it will certainly not be possible to create jobs for two million people , " he told the news magazine der spiegel .
" important parts of our concept are missing from the legislation , " he said .

in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career . his detractors call him a ' yuppie fascist ' , a ' xenophobic opportunist ' and a ' nazi apologist ' ; his supporters refer to him as a considerate person with great imagination and his wife calls him a man who has become more romantic with the years .
love him or hate him , everyone has an opinion on jörg haider .
he says all the wrong things - then he says all the right things .
he is either a brash , populist politician or a racist who supports aspects of nazism .
either way , he refuses to be ignored or go away .
he is the most prominent far-right fly in europe 's ointment .
the man who has courted controversy throughout his career added yet another twist to his tale on monday when he retracted his resignation as governor of the southern austrian stronghold of carinthia to head back into the political fray .
haider , the architect of the far-right freedom party 's rise to power , had decided to quit after his party received a crushing blow in sunday 's general elections and conceded defeat to coalition partners , the conservative people 's party .
back from the brink once again , haider does n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riess-passer : known as ' the king 's cobra ' when she was haider 's deputy .
it 's not the first time haider has done a u-turn .
he resigned as head of the party in 2000 , weeks after it entered the coalition government .
he handed over the reins of the party to vice-chancellor susanne riess-passer -lrb- photo -rrb- , and publicly focused on his southern stronghold of carinthia .
but , after a failed attempt to take back the leadership , haider continued to wield considerable influence behind the scenes .
the move to step back from leadership has done nothing to keep haider out of the pages of the press ; a place he has inhabited since his rise to power began 26 years ago .
the son of nazi party officials , haider spent his early days in the austrian town of bad goisern before leaving for vienna to study law .
it was there that he joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he became its leader 10 years later , when the party was barely getting 5 percent at the polls .
under his influence , the party has increased that support to 28 percent in the last 14 years .
freedom party 's election caused outrage across europe in that time , haider has caused much sensation , flattering and offending in equal measure .
when the freedom party came to power , the eu broke off bilateral relations with austria , imposed sanctions on it and enforced diplomatic isolation .
haider and his runaway mouth were cited as the cause for all this friction .
his misdemeanors are legion but the most infamous are those connected with his opinions about the nazis .
during his first stint as governor of carinthia in 1989 , haider said that the third reich had " a positive economic policy " which wiped out unemployment in germany .
his tenure ended abruptly and he was forced to resign a few years later , he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army that should be honored " .
he has also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .

in a time magazine interview at the time , haider attempted to defend himself : " as i have said before , i have made some mistakes in the past and i regret this and i apologize for having wounded people .
i have made it clear that the freedom party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism and national socialism . "
' dirty ' speech landed haider in court but he left clean but in 2001 , he was at it again .
haider avoided legal action after an austrian court threw out a complaint of anti-semitism against him .
the leader of austria 's jewish community , ariel muzicant , had accused haider of telling a cheering crowd that he could " not understand how someone called ariel could have so much dirt sticking to him " .
haider claimed that it was a pun on words as ariel is also a brand of washing powder , but critics said it was a clear reference to the nazi belief that jews were dirty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " yoo-hoo !
jorg !
over here ! "
variety seems to be the spice of life for haider .
when he 's not being named in football bribing scandals , cited in accusations of anti-semitism and racism - he 's taking business trips to libya and iraq to buy cheap fuel for the carinthians and flying on " secret missions " to moscow by the pistol manufacturer gaston glock , to look at buying soviet fighter jets .
nothing more than a cunning opportunist ?
although demonized by many , others inside and outside see him not only as a fascist but only as a cunning opportunist .
an editorial in the austrian daily die presse once said of him : " he 's a racist if it serves his purposes ; he 's a xenophobe if it serves his purposes ; he 's pro-europe if it serves his purposes ; and anti-europe if it serves his purposes .
haider would be orthodox communist if it helped him to get to power . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .
jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .

the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .

the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation . one of germany 's most charismatic political figures is on the verge of being kicked out of his party should he not resign first .
the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- federal leadership voted unanimously to oust the controversial möllemann if he he did not leave the party voluntarily by next monday .
the party has been tainted by a scandal involving illegal funding and an election pamphlet attacking israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
möllemann was dealt a further blow after his own state fdp association leaders followed their federal colleagues ' lead in demanding his expulsion .
the 57-year-old former cabinet minister is accused of orchestrating some € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- in illegal funding and attempting to cover up his actions .
damaging maneuvers in their report , fdp leaders said that möllemann had tried to maneuver the party " into the murky waters of the political fringe , " a reference to the pre-election campaign brochure in which he attacked sharon and michel friedman , vice-president of the central council of jews in germany .
the fdp 's poor showing in the september election , in which they only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote having aimed for 18 percent , is largely attributed to the brochure campaign accusing friedman of inciting anti-semitism .
seperately , möllemann is facing a criminal investigation in his home state on suspicion of violating party funding law .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament .
möllemann vows to fight but möllemann would not be möllemann if he did not come out fighting against the leadership 's decision .
" i would never in my wildest dreams have believed that the liberal party of law and order , the fdp , could have given me a political trial without hearing my testimony , " he said in a magazine interview to be released later this week .
and möllemann 's colleagues believe möllemann will put up a fight to the bitter end .
deputy chairman walter döring told the party to expect a " mudslinging match . "
birgit homburger , deputy chairwoman of the fdp 's parliamentary group , warned of a protracted affair : with a personality like möllemann you have to expect that he will inflict further damage on the party . "
" no other option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle will be hoping to exorcise the party 's ill-fated 18 percent campaign with möllemann 's expulsion .
guido westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- , the fdp 's youthful leader who some say covertly supported möllemann 's dogmatic approach in trying to put the party into the spotlight , is convinced that möllemann 's expulsion will be successful .
" the facts are clear , " he said , adding , " there is no other option . "
the case for möllemann 's expulsion will be put to an arbitration panel appointed by the party .
the party leadership said it would launch proceedings on december 9 should möllemann not quit voluntarily . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new anti-semitism flap tarnishes fdp leader a senior leader of the liberal free democrats is back in the headlines for taunting israeli prime minister ariel sharon and the head of germany ’ s biggest jewish organization in a campaign flyer .

yet chancellor gerhard schröder seems paralyzed by inertia , unable to act upon the most pressing problems facing his government . these are troubling times for germany 's chancellor , gerhard schröder , as he struggles to reassert his authority and personality on his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , his government and the electorate .
throw in the opposition and you have four formidable political institutions that seem to have lost all respect for the once mighty , media-savvy chancellor .
with germany facing recession and the potential pitfall of a war on iraq , the country is crying out for a strong leader more than ever .
however , schröder seems a shadow of his former self .
gone are the days when his political instinct took over and steamrollered his political friends and foes alike .
worrying signs from lower saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's state premier , may soon have to tell reporters why he lost his state 's election .
sigmar gabriel , the social democratic premier of lower saxony , which goes to the polls on february 2 , said over the weekend that the federal government 's policies were not helping his campaign .
" at the moment we are battling a strong headwind , " he said .
" of course people in lower saxony are also unsettled .
the government has taken on too much .
it would have been better to take one step at a time . "
a poll conducted last week showed the spd in lower saxony falling to 34 percent from 47.9 percent , while the opposition conservatives rose to 43 percent from 35.9 percent .
schröder 's disappearance since he barely scraped back to power just over two months ago , schröder has seen his support and that of this party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , plummet to record post-war lows .
a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy just after the election has sparked rumours and accusations that the government coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens deliberately misinformed the public .
ironically enough , the sentiment in germany seems to be that the public is prepared to face painful reforms of the labor market and the social welfare system in order to pull germany out of this quagmire .
what the public needs , however , is a tough-talking , honest chancellor telling them that sacrifices are required .
as sigmar gabriel put it : schröder " must show strong leadership again , because that is precisely why people elected him . "
the gerhard schröder of two or three years ago would have been precisely that figure , now , he is seen as procrastinating and keeping a low profile .
some observers note that schröder has acted similarly in the past , waiting for the opportune moment to move out of the background and take charge again .
calls for a " blood , sweat and tears " speech however , even schröder 's closest political allies are voicing doubts that the chancellor will use that sort of chance again .
heide simonis , the outspoken spd premier of schleswig-holstein , on monday called on the chancellor to deliver a " blood , sweat and tears " to the nation .
" there is only one thing left to do : tell the people what is wrong , what the situation is and what we are going to do about it , " she said .
she criticized the government for failing to present the public with a coherent , viable course of action for the legislative period .
calls to resign the opposition has called upon schröder and finance minister hans eichel to resign for misleading voters about the state of public finances .
sinking tax revenues and a budget deficit climbing above the 3 percent euro-zone threshold of gross domestic product have earned berlin a stinging rebuke from the eu commission .
edmund stoiber , the conservative chancellor candidate who narrowly lost to schröder , is confident voters will punish the government in the hesse and lower saxony state elections in february .
" the head of government has become a laughable number one in the hit parade as an electoral fraudster and hiker of taxes , " he said .
reforms watered down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , chairman of the commission to reform the labor market , has fiercely criticized the government 's backtracking over his proposals .
and there are harsh words too from those whose expertise was called upon to come up with proposals aimed at kickstarting germany 's economy .
peter hartz , for example , the volkswagen manager whose labor reform commission focused on halving unemployment , has vehemently attacked the government for backtracking and caving in to union demands .
" the way the plans look now , it will certainly not be possible to create jobs for two million people , " he told the news magazine der spiegel .
" important parts of our concept are missing from the legislation , " he said .
how and whether schröder will bounce back is anyone 's guess .

in a pamphlet being launched on tuesday , the foreign policy centre -lrb- fpc -rrb- says many firms have been put off taking precautions by the random nature of attacks in new york and bali .
the report follows a recent survey of 5,000 uk companies suggesting only 45 % of them had plans in place so they could continue their businesses in the wake of an attack .
the head of security at a leading insurer says companies ought to plan for far bigger damage than ever before , perhaps with similar effects on business as chernobyl .
indifference ?
the preparations warning comes after ministers urged people to be particularly vigilant against terror attacks .
bruce george , chairman of the commons select committee and contributor to the report , said : " despite the scale of the threat , it is truly amazing how many vulnerable enterprises do not appear to have been taking the risk more seriously . "
out of indifference or on a rational basis , companies have decided that little needs to be done , says mr george in an essay for the pamphlet .
bruce george says too many companies are doing too little the picture varies between different industries , says mr george , with some sectors better than others .
he points to us research suggesting business premises are more likely to be targeted than government buildings .
the fpc 's rachel briggs argues the unpredictable nature of international terrorism should not deter companies from trying to prepare for attacks .
she says the random nature of the us terror attacks " have led to a sense that homeland security can not defeat a determined terrorist threat " .
but she says that thinking nothing can be done against possible flying bombs or chemical attacks means the lessons of 11 september are being missed .
" the death toll might have been far worse if the twin towers had n't practiced evacuation procedures after the unsuccessful bomb attack to bring the towers down in 1993 , " she says .
those companies with contingency plans , including alternative accommodation , were far more likely to weather the storm , says ms briggs .
business staff need to form a new breed of counter-terrorist , she suggests .
government link sally leivesley , from risk analysis , argues in the report that a " one-stop shop " link is needed between companies and government .
that would help share information and intelligence , she suggests .
in another essay in the pamphlet , david veness , assistant commissioner at the metropolitan police , says financial institutions have responded well to such threats .
mr veness points to the way they worked in the past to the threat posed by the ira .
meanwhile , john smith , head of group security at prudential , underlines the potential risks companies face .
truck bombs it is prudent to plan on the timescales and geographic impact of a disaster like chernobyl , suggests mr smith .
" successful chemical , biological or radiological attacks may deny access to large segments of cities for significant periods , " argues mr smith .

in a pamphlet being launched on tuesday , the foreign policy centre -lrb- fpc -rrb- says many firms have been put off taking precautions by the random nature of attacks in new york and bali .
the report follows a recent survey of 5,000 uk companies suggesting only 45 % of them had plans in place so they could continue their businesses in the wake of an attack .
the head of security at a leading insurer says companies ought to plan for far bigger damage than ever before , perhaps with similar effects on business as chernobyl .
indifference ?
the preparations warning comes after ministers urged people to be particularly vigilant against terror attacks .
bruce george , chairman of the commons select committee and contributor to the report , said : " despite the scale of the threat , it is truly amazing how many vulnerable enterprises do not appear to have been taking the risk more seriously . "
out of indifference or on a rational basis , companies have decided that little needs to be done , says mr george in an essay for the pamphlet .
the picture varies between different industries , says mr george , with some sectors better than others .
he points to us research suggesting business premises are more likely to be targeted than government buildings .
the fpc 's rachel briggs argues the unpredictable nature of international terrorism should not deter companies from trying to prepare for attacks .
she says the random nature of the us terror attacks " have led to a sense that homeland security can not defeat a determined terrorist threat " .
but she says that thinking nothing can be done against possible flying bombs or chemical attacks means the lessons of 11 september are being missed .
" the death toll might have been far worse if the twin towers had n't practiced evacuation procedures after the unsuccessful bomb attack to bring the towers down in 1993 , " she says .
those companies with contingency plans , including alternative accommodation , were far more likely to weather the storm , says ms briggs .
business staff need to form a new breed of counter-terrorist , she suggests .
government link sally leivesley , from risk analysis , argues in the report that a " one-stop shop " link is needed between companies and government .
that would help share information and intelligence , she suggests .
in another essay in the pamphlet , david veness , assistant commissioner at the metropolitan police , says financial institutions have responded well to such threats .
mr veness points to the way they worked in the past to the threat posed by the ira .
meanwhile , john smith , head of group security at prudential , underlines the potential risks companies face .
truck bombs it is prudent to plan on the timescales and geographic impact of a disaster like chernobyl , suggests mr smith .
" successful chemical , biological or radiological attacks may deny access to large segments of cities for significant periods , " argues mr smith .
but roger davies , a former uk military counter-terrorism officer argues explosives remain the most likely weapon used by al-qaeda .
mr davies says cities should be able to cope with simultaneous truck bombs detonated without warning .
companies within 400 metres of an american , british or israeli embassy should especially review their crisis plans , he adds .

the short extension was agreed to allow time to resolve differences over the possible review of a list of items contained within the resolution that iraq is prohibited from importing under the oil-for-food programme .
the united states wants a tight timetable to add more items to the list , which it says iraq is trying to import for possible military use .
the oil-for-food programme is meant to be iraq 's humanitarian lifeline to the outside world .
the un monitors the sale of iraqi oil and keeps the proceeds in a special bank account .
the us wants to add to the list of items iraq may not purchase baghdad can then make requests for civilian goods , such as food and medicine , to be purchased from the account .
few here would argue that the system is perfect .
but it has worked reasonably well for many years , and the un security council was widely expected to adopt a resolution extending the programme for another six months .
but problems arose when the us said it wanted to add more items to a list of goods that iraq is forbidden from importing under the programme .
american officials argue that iraq is still attempting to import goods that could have some military use .
hasty review rejected specifically , us officials have mentioned electronic devices used to jam global positioning systems , and equipment that can intercept radio communication .
they are particularly concerned about what they say is an attempt by baghdad to procure huge quantities of atropine , a drug that can be used on the battlefield to combat the effects of a nerve gas attack .
other nations on the security council did not want to be pressured into making a hasty overhaul of the list of goods forbidden to iraq under the oil-for-food programme .
compromise finally came in an agreement to extend the programme for just nine days while efforts to resolve this dispute continue .

the 100m euros -lrb- £ 64m ; $ 100m -rrb- suit alleges morgan stanley 's research on lvmh was tainted because of the bank 's relationship with gucci .
the legal action is the latest against an investment bank claiming conflicts of interest .
" morgan stanley categorically rejects lvmh 's claim and stands by the integrity of its research , " the bank said in a statement .
lvmh is thought to have filed the action in the paris commercial court earlier this month .
" lvmh confirms it has filed a suit against morgan stanley , " a spokesman said .
stock tipping this latest claim over financial market research comes as the us stock market regulator , the securities and exchange commission , and state regulators are in talks with investment banks over fines relating to their equity research .
the regulators have found evidence that analysts prepared misleading reports about clients , and potential clients , to win more business from them .
morgan stanley was caught up in a separate controversy last week after it advised investors to take their money and " run the other way " from companies that are highly unionised industries .
the bank is an adviser to gucci and was one of its underwriter when it floated on the stock market in 1995 .
the case would be the latest twist in a long-running personal battle between bernard arnault of lvmh and the head of gucci , domenico de sole .
mr arnault tried unsuccessfully to take over gucci in the late 1990s in what was described as the " handbag war " .

peace process immediate ceasefire 150 international monitors to oversee ' peace zones ' prepare for free elections by 2004 rebels to put their arms " in storage " indonesian military to stop its offensive representatives of the movement in aceh say they are still not ready to retreat to defensive positions and begin handing over their weapons .
the indonesian government has threatened to seal off the province and try to crush the rebels if they do not sign the agreement .
more than 1,000 people , most of them civilians , have been killed this year in the brutal war between the acehnese rebels and the indonesian military .
that is actually an improvement on last year .
but there is an unmistakeable war-weariness in this province , which has helped push the two sides closer to signing a peace deal than at any time in the 26-year-long conflict .
mediators from the geneva-based henry dunant centre for humanitarian dialogue say an agreement based on indonesia 's offer of substantial autonomy should be signed in december .
but the free aceh movement still has strong reservations .
in particular , the rebels say they are reluctant to hand over their weapons to international monitors and retreat to agreed positions because they do not trust the indonesian military not to attack them .
they point to the example of east timor in 1999 , where the military violated promises to maintain order .
the persistent abuses of civilians by troops and police has alienated much of the local population .
but indonesia will not agree to pull them out for fear the province would then declare its independence .
for the moment , the rebels are well-armed and willing to fight on .
but they are finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds for their armed struggle from a population which is tired of being plundered by forces from both sides . watch / listen on this story marty natalegawa , indonesian foreign ministry " we intend to have an agreement signed by 9 december " teungku agam , gam 's military spokesman in aceh " the indonesian government - we can not trust them " see also : 19 nov 02 -pipe- asia-pacific indonesia close to aceh peace deal 05 aug 02 -pipe- asia-pacific indonesia delays aceh measures 17 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific aceh 's bloody war 10 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific aceh violence ' threatens us ties ' 22 apr 02 -pipe- asia-pacific viewpoint : aceh 's brutal conflict 17 jan 02 -pipe- asia-pacific aceh dreams of independence ' futile ' internet links : bbc indonesian service henry dunant centre free aceh movement the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : s korea subway inferno toll rises us plays down n korean threat thai pm says officials peddling drugs australia refuses to lift bali warning chinese official vows to end corruption japanese emperor back to work leatherbacks ' extinct in 30 years ' new project to demine tajikistan links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

that is the price passed on to shoppers shoppers as retailers are forced to offload their losses on law-abiding consumers .
with a girl and a pram , it 's a good decoy shoplifter ' dave ' the current affairs series , week in week out , examines how goods worth more than £ 1.5m are stolen from stores across wales each week .
the programme features a man who has stolen hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of goods to order .
the man , known as dave , made hundreds of pounds an hour and describes how he used babies as decoys to fool security staff as he smuggled stolen goods out of stores .
he said : " they were n't my kids - if i was n't with them doing it , earning money , somebody else would .
' soft crime ' " with a girl and a pram , it 's a good decoy - a shop assistant would n't say ' take the baby out of the cover , you might have something ' . "
the programme 's investigators go undercover to follow a gang of professional shoplifters who have been targeting high streets across the country in the run-up to christmas .
the thieves are caught on secret cameras , stuffing goods into bags and walking out without paying a penny .
shoplifting now costs the uk more than burglary and car crime .
professor joshua bamfield , of the centre for retail research , in nottingham , said that although half a million people are caught shoplifting each year , fewer than 10 % appear in court .
he said : " at the moment it 's seen as a ' soft crime ' and very little happens , so people always vote for retail crime because it 's easy and there is very little downside to it .

but the endless jams showed a remarkable lack of foresight , an inability to listen and learn from the experts and that the focus of attention in 1978 , when the work started , was quite clearly elsewhere .
the westlink , at the edge of west belfast , was built to link the two key motorways and draw traffic away from the centre of belfast .
the public inquiry , starting in belfast on tuesday , will hear of a need to widen the westlink and part of the nearby motorway to three lanes as a necessity to handle the additional volume of traffic .
it is planned that two roundabouts , which are serious bottlenecks at peak times , will be replaced by two flyovers .
parts of the road are to be lowered to keep traffic noise to a minimum in what is a major residential area .
curiously , at another public inquiry in belfast in 1977 , the case put forward was for a three lane system , lowered to keep the noise down and complete with two flyovers to prevent bottlenecks at roundabouts .
' instant jams ' but despite warnings at the time , much of this was abandoned .
the result when the system was opened in 1983 was instant traffic jams .
there was simply too much traffic wanting to use it .
now almost 20 years later , having learnt from the mistakes , it has been decided to revert to the original plans .
but the traffic flow has dramatically increased and it is unlikely this system could ever be engineered to cope on its own .
this public inquiry will hear of plans for an extra lane in each direction , but probably dedicated to buses and lorries .
interest groups representatives from the department of regional development will explain how critical it is for the road to be developed .
even organisations like friends of the earth have backed off a little in their ardent opposition to the development of the route .
the environmental lobby group wants a lane to be dedicated to public transport and heavy freight but with no extra lanes being added .
in other words , squeeze the motorist onto public transport .
they do have a considerable argument behind their rationale .
in linking the m1 motorway to the m2 , the westlink effectively gives access to belfast harbour , northern ireland 's main port .
port impact it is being slowly stifled by the traffic jams on the westlink and lorry drivers from the west of ireland have started to give belfast a miss , favouring instead the expanding port of dublin .
to add to the consternation of the belfast harbour commissioners , the port of dublin has almost completed a two-kilometre tunnel from the city outskirts which will give heavy lorries an exclusive high speed access to cross-channel ferries to england and wales .
faced with this and a snarled-up westlink , the commissioners in belfast are more than a little edgy .
they are watching customers vote with their wheels and move south .
so they will be at the public hearing to put their case .
against expansion local environment groups will also be there to have their say .
most do not want to see the expansion of the existing system .
instead , they just want to see priority given to freight and public transport .
it is unlikely the inquiry will accept such a radical move , but there is increasing sympathy to the problem of too many cars on too little tarmac .
it is no worse than any other large city and better than most .
but the westlink could rapidly become a total disaster if the problem is not tackled in some way .
so more room will have to be created for cars - if only by moving buses and lorries to their own lane .
residential areas there is little prospect for those who live alongside it of it ever getting much better .
but if there were to be extra lanes , there could be some spin-offs .
already when the system jams up , motorists move to the roads running parallel to the westlink to bypass the bypass .
this means heavy rush hour traffic using major residential areas as a " rat run " to escape the jams .
a better road system would reduce this traffic , reducing noise , danger and pollution at the same time .
pollution so the case for the local community will be a strong one .
but not a winner in their terms .
they already face the noise , fumes and delays the westlink has brought them .
engineers promise that a faster moving westlink , even with more traffic , would be quieter and less polluting .
cynics doubt their case , but it does have more than an element of truth in it .
however , the chances are that once the new improved westlink opens , its popularity and limited expansion will quickly conspire to bring it to a halt - again . watch / listen on this story bbc ni 's environment correspondent mike mckimm : " the westlink became a victim of its own success " see also : 03 jul 02 -pipe- n ireland first ni transport strategy unveiled 04 feb 02 -pipe- n ireland roads targeted in transport plan 21 nov 01 -pipe- n ireland report critical of transport services internet links : friends of the earth ni department of regional development institute of highways and transport motorway archive - westlink the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top n ireland stories now : nail bombs thrown at station omagh detectives make arrest orde defends inquiry comments warders still concerned at breach sdlp member ' being forced out ' jobs threat at council family claim attack was ' sectarian ' adair fails in prison challenge links to more n ireland stories are at the foot of the page .

demonstrators plan to voice concerns about welsh-speaking areas being developed for commuters from england when they make their stand on tuesday .
it 's a travesty that the assembly is n't prepared to intervene to ensure that local people have first choice in the housing market gruff roberts , cymuned the demonstration is the first of a series of pickets aimed at highlighting cymuned 's concerns at the state of the housing market in welsh-speaking areas .
protests have also being staged in pwllheli , porthmadog , caernarfon and bangor .
members are angry that homes in places such as the vale of clwyd are being advertised to people over the border .
they say the prices of properties are often too high for people in wales .
they also believe the welsh assembly government should intervene to ensure local people have first choice in the housing market .
concerns cymuned has stressed that , without official intervention , an influx of non-welsh speakers could occur and have a devastating impact on the language gruff roberts , organiser of the vale of clwyd branch of cymuned , said the chester protest was a way of illustrating the group 's concerns .
" this is a perfect example of how wales is on sale , with the housing market based on the needs of english cities like chester rather than on the needs of our own people , " he said .
" an awful amount of property from the vale of clwyd and north-east wales is on sale there .
campaigners want the assembly to take action " it is proof of how welsh-speaking communities in denbighshire , the conwy valley and other parts of north wales near the a55 are being developed as commuter country for the north-west of england .
" this is having a devastating effect on the welsh language .
" property in gwynedd and anglesey is also on sale there , houses in villages like morfa nefyn and garndolbenmaen .
" they are going for prices far beyond what people in wales can afford : £ 230,00 for a house in y felinheli , £ 225,000 for a house in harlech . "
" it 's a travesty that the assembly is n't prepared to intervene to ensure that local people have first choice in the housing market . "
earlier this year , cymuned members flew to switzerland to press their case for supporting minority groups .
the group gave evidence to the united nations committee 's working group on minorities about the threat to welsh-speaking communities in rural areas .
