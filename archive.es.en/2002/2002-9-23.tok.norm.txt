boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 23.09.2002 how to repair a " badly bruised " relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , joschka , trouble on the horizon with a heated , anti-american campaign behind him , chancellor schröder is eager to smooth things out with washington .
transatlantic experts say he has his work cut out for him . the two couldn ’ t have been happier . with arms on each other ’ s shoulders chancellor gerhard schröder and his green foreign minister , joschka fischer , announced the continuation of their red-green coalition government in the wee hours of the morning in berlin on monday .
their informal speeches were punctuated by cheers and whoops from the raucous crowd gathered outside of the social democratic party headquarters , who had stayed to watch the two claim victory in germany ’ s cliffhanger election . the reaction in washington has been more subdued .
since coming out strongly against american policy on iraq and since a newspaper alleged one of his cabinet members compared president george w. bush ’ s iraq strategy with hitler ’ s , schröder and his government have become persona non grata inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld testifies on capitol hill sept .
19 , 2002 , before the senate armed services committee hearing on iraq .
rumsfeld says the target of a u.s. military attack on iraq would be saddam hussein 's narrow power base , not the country 's civilian infrastructure .
-lrb- ap photo / dennis cook -rrb- bush has yet to call schröder to congratulate him on his victory and us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- renewed his accusation on monday that the relationship had been “ poisoned . ” relationship " intact , " says chancellor with the heat of the tightest election battle in germany ’ s postwar history behind them , schröder and fischer have now begun trying to ease the tension that has increased between the historically-close transatlantic neighbors . the relationship between berlin and washington is “ intact ” said schröder , who on monday accepted the resignation of the offending cabinet member , justice minister herta daübler-gmelin .
his foreign minister , who is believed to have support in washington , seemed to strike a conciliatory note as well . " america is a guarantor of peace and security , " fischer said .
" the united states is our most important partner and we want to further develop the traditionally good path of our relations . " easier said than done , say those working to build the transatlantic relationship . schröder ’ s unflinching refusal to support a us-led invasion of iraq – with or without a united nations mandate – has caused serious , long-term damage to us-german relations , they say . loss of support part of gradual trend “ he ’ s messed it up so badly , ” said andrea mehrlaender , director of the checkpoint charlie foundation in berlin , of schröder . “ he needs to do something and do something before christmas .
and a plain letter is not enough . ” rather than an exception , merhlaender saw schröder ’ s stance as part of a gradual movement taking place in germany ’ s political establishment . in lobbying for money for the bilateral projects the foundation sponsors , merhlaender says she has faced more closed doors since the social democrats took over power from the conservative , pro-american christian democratic union , in berlin . “ ideology-wise , the spd party program has never been pro-american in any way , ” mehrlaender said in an interview .
“ i mean , it ’ s not outspokenly anti-american .
but it has always been more leftist and critical of the us . ” so when a center-right government in washington came to power in 2000 , friction was bound to develop with the center-left red-green coalition . " badly bruised " relationship “ from the outset , these are not ideal partners , ” said dr. jeffrey gedmin , director of the conservative aspen institute in berlin .
but independent of the ideological differences , gedmin says the “ re-negotiation ” of the german-american relationship has been the most obvious point of divide between the two nations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . “ you have a re-negotiation of the relationship where the german side , now united , now sovereign , wants more respect , more voice and more insurance , ” he told dw-world .
“ and that ’ s normal .
that ’ s healthy . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor gerhard schroeder of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- flashes a smile during a press conference at the party 's headquarter in berlin on monday , sept .
23 , 2002 .
after the final results schroeder has won the germany 's elections general and will continue the coalition with the greens .
but schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- “ overplayed his hand ” with his election rhetoric , gedmin said . “ it ’ s not that the sky is falling , the relationship has more at stake than just iraq , ” said gedmin .
“ but i think it ’ s badly bruised . ” analysts are suggesting schröder or fischer pay a visit to washington soon to iron things out .
gedmin thinks schröder should hustle to make germany 's iraq opposition a non-issue . " like the berlin weather , he will have to dampen this , " gedmin said .
" he will have to make it as calm and boring as humanely possible over the next couple of months . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery dw-world 's up-to-date special section on the german federal elections .

the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .
as members of parliament of a party that is not officially represented , neither petra pau , who is currently the pds ’ s deputy chairwoman , nor gersine lötzsch will have the ability to submit legislation , to introduce issues for debate on the floor or to vote on drafts of legislation when they are still at committee level .
in other words , they will have literally no chance of putting their fingerprints on the laws passed during the bundestag ’ s next legislative period . speaking in berlin on monday , roland claus , who is head of the pds ’ s parliamentary group , said the party is considering calling for changes in leadership as a result of the poor showing .
however , pds chairwoman gabi zimmer has said she will not offer her resignation . the loss dealt a particularly heavy blow to the more than 200 employees of the pds in the bundestag , who will now become statistics in germany 's swollen unemployment roster . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .

his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .

the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .
with this red-green coalition , germany won ’ t return to economic health . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jobless rate on the upswing just six weeks before federal elections in germany , the unemployment rate hit 9.7 percent .
that means more than 4 million germans are unemployed .
and it creates a real challenge for the schröder campaign .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .
with this red-green coalition , germany won ’ t return to economic health . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jobless rate on the upswing just six weeks before federal elections in germany , the unemployment rate hit 9.7 percent .
that means more than 4 million germans are unemployed .
and it creates a real challenge for the schröder campaign .

the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .
as members of parliament of a party that is not officially represented , neither petra pau , who is currently the pds ’ s deputy chairwoman , nor gersine lötzsch will have the ability to submit legislation , to introduce issues for debate on the floor or to vote on drafts of legislation when they are still at committee level .
in other words , they will have literally no chance of putting their fingerprints on the laws passed during the bundestag ’ s next legislative period . speaking in berlin on monday , roland claus , who is head of the pds ’ s parliamentary group , said the party is considering calling for changes in leadership as a result of the poor showing .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 23.09.2002 how to repair a " badly bruised " relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , joschka , trouble on the horizon with a heated , anti-american campaign behind him , chancellor schröder is eager to smooth things out with washington .
transatlantic experts say he has his work cut out for him . the two couldn ’ t have been happier . with arms on each other ’ s shoulders chancellor gerhard schröder and his green foreign minister , joschka fischer , announced the continuation of their red-green coalition government in the wee hours of the morning in berlin on monday .
their informal speeches were punctuated by cheers and whoops from the raucous crowd gathered outside of the social democratic party headquarters , who had stayed to watch the two claim victory in germany ’ s cliffhanger election . the reaction in washington has been more subdued .
since coming out strongly against american policy on iraq and since a newspaper alleged one of his cabinet members compared president george w. bush ’ s iraq strategy with hitler ’ s , schröder and his government have become persona non grata inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld testifies on capitol hill sept .
19 , 2002 , before the senate armed services committee hearing on iraq .
rumsfeld says the target of a u.s. military attack on iraq would be saddam hussein 's narrow power base , not the country 's civilian infrastructure .
-lrb- ap photo / dennis cook -rrb- bush has yet to call schröder to congratulate him on his victory and us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- renewed his accusation on monday that the relationship had been “ poisoned . ” relationship " intact , " says chancellor with the heat of the tightest election battle in germany ’ s postwar history behind them , schröder and fischer have now begun trying to ease the tension that has increased between the historically-close transatlantic neighbors . the relationship between berlin and washington is “ intact ” said schröder , who on monday accepted the resignation of the offending cabinet member , justice minister herta daübler-gmelin .
his foreign minister , who is believed to have support in washington , seemed to strike a conciliatory note as well . " america is a guarantor of peace and security , " fischer said .
" the united states is our most important partner and we want to further develop the traditionally good path of our relations . " easier said than done , say those working to build the transatlantic relationship . schröder ’ s unflinching refusal to support a us-led invasion of iraq – with or without a united nations mandate – has caused serious , long-term damage to us-german relations , they say . loss of support part of gradual trend “ he ’ s messed it up so badly , ” said andrea mehrlaender , director of the checkpoint charlie foundation in berlin , of schröder . “ he needs to do something and do something before christmas .
and a plain letter is not enough . ” rather than an exception , merhlaender saw schröder ’ s stance as part of a gradual movement taking place in germany ’ s political establishment . in lobbying for money for the bilateral projects the foundation sponsors , merhlaender says she has faced more closed doors since the social democrats took over power from the conservative , pro-american christian democratic union , in berlin . “ ideology-wise , the spd party program has never been pro-american in any way , ” mehrlaender said in an interview .
“ i mean , it ’ s not outspokenly anti-american .
but it has always been more leftist and critical of the us . ” so when a center-right government in washington came to power in 2000 , friction was bound to develop with the center-left red-green coalition . " badly bruised " relationship “ from the outset , these are not ideal partners , ” said dr. jeffrey gedmin , director of the conservative aspen institute in berlin .
but independent of the ideological differences , gedmin says the “ re-negotiation ” of the german-american relationship has been the most obvious point of divide between the two nations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . “ you have a re-negotiation of the relationship where the german side , now united , now sovereign , wants more respect , more voice and more insurance , ” he told dw-world .
“ and that ’ s normal .
that ’ s healthy . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor gerhard schroeder of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- flashes a smile during a press conference at the party 's headquarter in berlin on monday , sept .
23 , 2002 .
after the final results schroeder has won the germany 's elections general and will continue the coalition with the greens .
but schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- “ overplayed his hand ” with his election rhetoric , gedmin said . “ it ’ s not that the sky is falling , the relationship has more at stake than just iraq , ” said gedmin .
“ but i think it ’ s badly bruised . ” analysts are suggesting schröder or fischer pay a visit to washington soon to iron things out .
gedmin thinks schröder should hustle to make germany 's iraq opposition a non-issue . " like the berlin weather , he will have to dampen this , " gedmin said .
" he will have to make it as calm and boring as humanely possible over the next couple of months . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery dw-world 's up-to-date special section on the german federal elections .

news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .

even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .

the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .
with this red-green coalition , germany won ’ t return to economic health . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jobless rate on the upswing just six weeks before federal elections in germany , the unemployment rate hit 9.7 percent .
that means more than 4 million germans are unemployed .
and it creates a real challenge for the schröder campaign .

“ i mean , it ’ s not outspokenly anti-american .
but it has always been more leftist and critical of the us . ” so when a center-right government in washington came to power in 2000 , friction was bound to develop with the center-left red-green coalition . " badly bruised " relationship “ from the outset , these are not ideal partners , ” said dr. jeffrey gedmin , director of the conservative aspen institute in berlin .
but independent of the ideological differences , gedmin says the “ re-negotiation ” of the german-american relationship has been the most obvious point of divide between the two nations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . “ you have a re-negotiation of the relationship where the german side , now united , now sovereign , wants more respect , more voice and more insurance , ” he told dw-world .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .
with this red-green coalition , germany won ’ t return to economic health . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jobless rate on the upswing just six weeks before federal elections in germany , the unemployment rate hit 9.7 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 23.09.2002 election outcome hinged on third parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's unexpected success sunday helped secure a second government term for chancellor gerhard schröder .
the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .

the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2002 it 's back to the economy again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coming weeks wo n't be a bed of roses for german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .
they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .
with this red-green coalition , germany won ’ t return to economic health . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jobless rate on the upswing just six weeks before federal elections in germany , the unemployment rate hit 9.7 percent .
that means more than 4 million germans are unemployed .
and it creates a real challenge for the schröder campaign .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 23.09.2002 how to repair a " badly bruised " relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , joschka , trouble on the horizon with a heated , anti-american campaign behind him , chancellor schröder is eager to smooth things out with washington .
transatlantic experts say he has his work cut out for him . the two couldn ’ t have been happier . with arms on each other ’ s shoulders chancellor gerhard schröder and his green foreign minister , joschka fischer , announced the continuation of their red-green coalition government in the wee hours of the morning in berlin on monday .
their informal speeches were punctuated by cheers and whoops from the raucous crowd gathered outside of the social democratic party headquarters , who had stayed to watch the two claim victory in germany ’ s cliffhanger election . the reaction in washington has been more subdued .
since coming out strongly against american policy on iraq and since a newspaper alleged one of his cabinet members compared president george w. bush ’ s iraq strategy with hitler ’ s , schröder and his government have become persona non grata inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld testifies on capitol hill sept .
19 , 2002 , before the senate armed services committee hearing on iraq .
rumsfeld says the target of a u.s. military attack on iraq would be saddam hussein 's narrow power base , not the country 's civilian infrastructure .
-lrb- ap photo / dennis cook -rrb- bush has yet to call schröder to congratulate him on his victory and us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- renewed his accusation on monday that the relationship had been “ poisoned . ” relationship " intact , " says chancellor with the heat of the tightest election battle in germany ’ s postwar history behind them , schröder and fischer have now begun trying to ease the tension that has increased between the historically-close transatlantic neighbors . the relationship between berlin and washington is “ intact ” said schröder , who on monday accepted the resignation of the offending cabinet member , justice minister herta daübler-gmelin .
his foreign minister , who is believed to have support in washington , seemed to strike a conciliatory note as well . " america is a guarantor of peace and security , " fischer said .
" the united states is our most important partner and we want to further develop the traditionally good path of our relations . " easier said than done , say those working to build the transatlantic relationship . schröder ’ s unflinching refusal to support a us-led invasion of iraq – with or without a united nations mandate – has caused serious , long-term damage to us-german relations , they say . loss of support part of gradual trend “ he ’ s messed it up so badly , ” said andrea mehrlaender , director of the checkpoint charlie foundation in berlin , of schröder . “ he needs to do something and do something before christmas .
and a plain letter is not enough . ” rather than an exception , merhlaender saw schröder ’ s stance as part of a gradual movement taking place in germany ’ s political establishment . in lobbying for money for the bilateral projects the foundation sponsors , merhlaender says she has faced more closed doors since the social democrats took over power from the conservative , pro-american christian democratic union , in berlin . “ ideology-wise , the spd party program has never been pro-american in any way , ” mehrlaender said in an interview .
“ i mean , it ’ s not outspokenly anti-american .
but it has always been more leftist and critical of the us . ” so when a center-right government in washington came to power in 2000 , friction was bound to develop with the center-left red-green coalition . " badly bruised " relationship “ from the outset , these are not ideal partners , ” said dr. jeffrey gedmin , director of the conservative aspen institute in berlin .
but independent of the ideological differences , gedmin says the “ re-negotiation ” of the german-american relationship has been the most obvious point of divide between the two nations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . “ you have a re-negotiation of the relationship where the german side , now united , now sovereign , wants more respect , more voice and more insurance , ” he told dw-world .
“ and that ’ s normal .
that ’ s healthy . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor gerhard schroeder of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- flashes a smile during a press conference at the party 's headquarter in berlin on monday , sept .

but schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- “ overplayed his hand ” with his election rhetoric , gedmin said . “ it ’ s not that the sky is falling , the relationship has more at stake than just iraq , ” said gedmin .
“ but i think it ’ s badly bruised . ” analysts are suggesting schröder or fischer pay a visit to washington soon to iron things out .
gedmin thinks schröder should hustle to make germany 's iraq opposition a non-issue . " like the berlin weather , he will have to dampen this , " gedmin said .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .
with this red-green coalition , germany won ’ t return to economic health . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jobless rate on the upswing just six weeks before federal elections in germany , the unemployment rate hit 9.7 percent .
that means more than 4 million germans are unemployed .
and it creates a real challenge for the schröder campaign .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 23.09.2002 election outcome hinged on third parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's unexpected success sunday helped secure a second government term for chancellor gerhard schröder .
the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .
as members of parliament of a party that is not officially represented , neither petra pau , who is currently the pds ’ s deputy chairwoman , nor gersine lötzsch will have the ability to submit legislation , to introduce issues for debate on the floor or to vote on drafts of legislation when they are still at committee level .
in other words , they will have literally no chance of putting their fingerprints on the laws passed during the bundestag ’ s next legislative period . speaking in berlin on monday , roland claus , who is head of the pds ’ s parliamentary group , said the party is considering calling for changes in leadership as a result of the poor showing .
however , pds chairwoman gabi zimmer has said she will not offer her resignation . the loss dealt a particularly heavy blow to the more than 200 employees of the pds in the bundestag , who will now become statistics in germany 's swollen unemployment roster . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

" many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .
as members of parliament of a party that is not officially represented , neither petra pau , who is currently the pds ’ s deputy chairwoman , nor gersine lötzsch will have the ability to submit legislation , to introduce issues for debate on the floor or to vote on drafts of legislation when they are still at committee level .
in other words , they will have literally no chance of putting their fingerprints on the laws passed during the bundestag ’ s next legislative period . speaking in berlin on monday , roland claus , who is head of the pds ’ s parliamentary group , said the party is considering calling for changes in leadership as a result of the poor showing .
however , pds chairwoman gabi zimmer has said she will not offer her resignation . the loss dealt a particularly heavy blow to the more than 200 employees of the pds in the bundestag , who will now become statistics in germany 's swollen unemployment roster . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .

transatlantic experts say he has his work cut out for him . the two couldn ’ t have been happier . with arms on each other ’ s shoulders chancellor gerhard schröder and his green foreign minister , joschka fischer , announced the continuation of their red-green coalition government in the wee hours of the morning in berlin on monday .
their informal speeches were punctuated by cheers and whoops from the raucous crowd gathered outside of the social democratic party headquarters , who had stayed to watch the two claim victory in germany ’ s cliffhanger election . the reaction in washington has been more subdued .
since coming out strongly against american policy on iraq and since a newspaper alleged one of his cabinet members compared president george w. bush ’ s iraq strategy with hitler ’ s , schröder and his government have become persona non grata inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld testifies on capitol hill sept .
19 , 2002 , before the senate armed services committee hearing on iraq .
rumsfeld says the target of a u.s. military attack on iraq would be saddam hussein 's narrow power base , not the country 's civilian infrastructure .

his foreign minister , who is believed to have support in washington , seemed to strike a conciliatory note as well . " america is a guarantor of peace and security , " fischer said .
" the united states is our most important partner and we want to further develop the traditionally good path of our relations . " easier said than done , say those working to build the transatlantic relationship . schröder ’ s unflinching refusal to support a us-led invasion of iraq – with or without a united nations mandate – has caused serious , long-term damage to us-german relations , they say . loss of support part of gradual trend “ he ’ s messed it up so badly , ” said andrea mehrlaender , director of the checkpoint charlie foundation in berlin , of schröder . “ he needs to do something and do something before christmas .
and a plain letter is not enough . ” rather than an exception , merhlaender saw schröder ’ s stance as part of a gradual movement taking place in germany ’ s political establishment . in lobbying for money for the bilateral projects the foundation sponsors , merhlaender says she has faced more closed doors since the social democrats took over power from the conservative , pro-american christian democratic union , in berlin . “ ideology-wise , the spd party program has never been pro-american in any way , ” mehrlaender said in an interview .
“ i mean , it ’ s not outspokenly anti-american .
but it has always been more leftist and critical of the us . ” so when a center-right government in washington came to power in 2000 , friction was bound to develop with the center-left red-green coalition . " badly bruised " relationship “ from the outset , these are not ideal partners , ” said dr. jeffrey gedmin , director of the conservative aspen institute in berlin .
but independent of the ideological differences , gedmin says the “ re-negotiation ” of the german-american relationship has been the most obvious point of divide between the two nations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . “ you have a re-negotiation of the relationship where the german side , now united , now sovereign , wants more respect , more voice and more insurance , ” he told dw-world .

“ but i think it ’ s badly bruised . ” analysts are suggesting schröder or fischer pay a visit to washington soon to iron things out .
gedmin thinks schröder should hustle to make germany 's iraq opposition a non-issue . " like the berlin weather , he will have to dampen this , " gedmin said .

the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 23.09.2002 how to repair a " badly bruised " relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , joschka , trouble on the horizon with a heated , anti-american campaign behind him , chancellor schröder is eager to smooth things out with washington .
transatlantic experts say he has his work cut out for him . the two couldn ’ t have been happier . with arms on each other ’ s shoulders chancellor gerhard schröder and his green foreign minister , joschka fischer , announced the continuation of their red-green coalition government in the wee hours of the morning in berlin on monday .
their informal speeches were punctuated by cheers and whoops from the raucous crowd gathered outside of the social democratic party headquarters , who had stayed to watch the two claim victory in germany ’ s cliffhanger election . the reaction in washington has been more subdued .
since coming out strongly against american policy on iraq and since a newspaper alleged one of his cabinet members compared president george w. bush ’ s iraq strategy with hitler ’ s , schröder and his government have become persona non grata inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld testifies on capitol hill sept .
19 , 2002 , before the senate armed services committee hearing on iraq .
rumsfeld says the target of a u.s. military attack on iraq would be saddam hussein 's narrow power base , not the country 's civilian infrastructure .
-lrb- ap photo / dennis cook -rrb- bush has yet to call schröder to congratulate him on his victory and us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- renewed his accusation on monday that the relationship had been “ poisoned . ” relationship " intact , " says chancellor with the heat of the tightest election battle in germany ’ s postwar history behind them , schröder and fischer have now begun trying to ease the tension that has increased between the historically-close transatlantic neighbors . the relationship between berlin and washington is “ intact ” said schröder , who on monday accepted the resignation of the offending cabinet member , justice minister herta daübler-gmelin .
his foreign minister , who is believed to have support in washington , seemed to strike a conciliatory note as well . " america is a guarantor of peace and security , " fischer said .
" the united states is our most important partner and we want to further develop the traditionally good path of our relations . " easier said than done , say those working to build the transatlantic relationship . schröder ’ s unflinching refusal to support a us-led invasion of iraq – with or without a united nations mandate – has caused serious , long-term damage to us-german relations , they say . loss of support part of gradual trend “ he ’ s messed it up so badly , ” said andrea mehrlaender , director of the checkpoint charlie foundation in berlin , of schröder . “ he needs to do something and do something before christmas .
and a plain letter is not enough . ” rather than an exception , merhlaender saw schröder ’ s stance as part of a gradual movement taking place in germany ’ s political establishment . in lobbying for money for the bilateral projects the foundation sponsors , merhlaender says she has faced more closed doors since the social democrats took over power from the conservative , pro-american christian democratic union , in berlin . “ ideology-wise , the spd party program has never been pro-american in any way , ” mehrlaender said in an interview .
“ i mean , it ’ s not outspokenly anti-american .
but it has always been more leftist and critical of the us . ” so when a center-right government in washington came to power in 2000 , friction was bound to develop with the center-left red-green coalition . " badly bruised " relationship “ from the outset , these are not ideal partners , ” said dr. jeffrey gedmin , director of the conservative aspen institute in berlin .
but independent of the ideological differences , gedmin says the “ re-negotiation ” of the german-american relationship has been the most obvious point of divide between the two nations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . “ you have a re-negotiation of the relationship where the german side , now united , now sovereign , wants more respect , more voice and more insurance , ” he told dw-world .
“ and that ’ s normal .
that ’ s healthy . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor gerhard schroeder of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- flashes a smile during a press conference at the party 's headquarter in berlin on monday , sept .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 23.09.2002 election outcome hinged on third parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's unexpected success sunday helped secure a second government term for chancellor gerhard schröder .
the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .
as members of parliament of a party that is not officially represented , neither petra pau , who is currently the pds ’ s deputy chairwoman , nor gersine lötzsch will have the ability to submit legislation , to introduce issues for debate on the floor or to vote on drafts of legislation when they are still at committee level .
in other words , they will have literally no chance of putting their fingerprints on the laws passed during the bundestag ’ s next legislative period . speaking in berlin on monday , roland claus , who is head of the pds ’ s parliamentary group , said the party is considering calling for changes in leadership as a result of the poor showing .
however , pds chairwoman gabi zimmer has said she will not offer her resignation . the loss dealt a particularly heavy blow to the more than 200 employees of the pds in the bundestag , who will now become statistics in germany 's swollen unemployment roster . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 23.09.2002 how to repair a " badly bruised " relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , joschka , trouble on the horizon with a heated , anti-american campaign behind him , chancellor schröder is eager to smooth things out with washington .
transatlantic experts say he has his work cut out for him . the two couldn ’ t have been happier . with arms on each other ’ s shoulders chancellor gerhard schröder and his green foreign minister , joschka fischer , announced the continuation of their red-green coalition government in the wee hours of the morning in berlin on monday .
their informal speeches were punctuated by cheers and whoops from the raucous crowd gathered outside of the social democratic party headquarters , who had stayed to watch the two claim victory in germany ’ s cliffhanger election . the reaction in washington has been more subdued .
since coming out strongly against american policy on iraq and since a newspaper alleged one of his cabinet members compared president george w. bush ’ s iraq strategy with hitler ’ s , schröder and his government have become persona non grata inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld testifies on capitol hill sept .
19 , 2002 , before the senate armed services committee hearing on iraq .
rumsfeld says the target of a u.s. military attack on iraq would be saddam hussein 's narrow power base , not the country 's civilian infrastructure .

his foreign minister , who is believed to have support in washington , seemed to strike a conciliatory note as well . " america is a guarantor of peace and security , " fischer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 23.09.2002 election outcome hinged on third parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's unexpected success sunday helped secure a second government term for chancellor gerhard schröder .
the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .
as members of parliament of a party that is not officially represented , neither petra pau , who is currently the pds ’ s deputy chairwoman , nor gersine lötzsch will have the ability to submit legislation , to introduce issues for debate on the floor or to vote on drafts of legislation when they are still at committee level .
in other words , they will have literally no chance of putting their fingerprints on the laws passed during the bundestag ’ s next legislative period . speaking in berlin on monday , roland claus , who is head of the pds ’ s parliamentary group , said the party is considering calling for changes in leadership as a result of the poor showing .
however , pds chairwoman gabi zimmer has said she will not offer her resignation . the loss dealt a particularly heavy blow to the more than 200 employees of the pds in the bundestag , who will now become statistics in germany 's swollen unemployment roster . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 23.09.2002 election outcome hinged on third parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's unexpected success sunday helped secure a second government term for chancellor gerhard schröder .
the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .
as members of parliament of a party that is not officially represented , neither petra pau , who is currently the pds ’ s deputy chairwoman , nor gersine lötzsch will have the ability to submit legislation , to introduce issues for debate on the floor or to vote on drafts of legislation when they are still at committee level .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .
plenty of hurdles for schröder to overcome but the going will be far from smooth for schröder .
analysts fear that schröder will be hindered in carrying out economic reforms by a stronger green party , buoyed by its election result .
it could push harder for further promotion of renewable energy and the " eco tax " series of fuel tax increases hated by business .
schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .
and edmund stoiber , the bavarian state premier and conservative loser in sunday 's election , had an ominous prediction : " the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .
" we need a change of policy , under whatever government , " said michael rogowski , chairman of bdi , the german industry federation , on sunday evening .
rogowski said germany has developed in the direction of a social economy for too long .
" a more market-based economy and more corporate freedom " is the need of the hour , he said .
referring to the spd ’ s traditional strong links to trade unions , rogowski said , " the spd is so enveloped by the unions that it will be difficult for it -lrb- the party -rrb- to break free . "
werner wenning , chief executive of bayer , the chemicals group , said , " instead of quick fixes , we urgently need to change the whole system . "
it 's the economy , stupid !
indeed the economy poses one of the biggest challenges to a weakened spd-green coalition .
reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .

schröder also faces an upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the government that narrowly robbed them of victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 23.09.2002 election outcome hinged on third parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's unexpected success sunday helped secure a second government term for chancellor gerhard schröder .
the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .
as members of parliament of a party that is not officially represented , neither petra pau , who is currently the pds ’ s deputy chairwoman , nor gersine lötzsch will have the ability to submit legislation , to introduce issues for debate on the floor or to vote on drafts of legislation when they are still at committee level .
in other words , they will have literally no chance of putting their fingerprints on the laws passed during the bundestag ’ s next legislative period . speaking in berlin on monday , roland claus , who is head of the pds ’ s parliamentary group , said the party is considering calling for changes in leadership as a result of the poor showing .
however , pds chairwoman gabi zimmer has said she will not offer her resignation . the loss dealt a particularly heavy blow to the more than 200 employees of the pds in the bundestag , who will now become statistics in germany 's swollen unemployment roster . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 23.09.2002 how to repair a " badly bruised " relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , joschka , trouble on the horizon with a heated , anti-american campaign behind him , chancellor schröder is eager to smooth things out with washington .
transatlantic experts say he has his work cut out for him . the two couldn ’ t have been happier . with arms on each other ’ s shoulders chancellor gerhard schröder and his green foreign minister , joschka fischer , announced the continuation of their red-green coalition government in the wee hours of the morning in berlin on monday .
their informal speeches were punctuated by cheers and whoops from the raucous crowd gathered outside of the social democratic party headquarters , who had stayed to watch the two claim victory in germany ’ s cliffhanger election . the reaction in washington has been more subdued .
since coming out strongly against american policy on iraq and since a newspaper alleged one of his cabinet members compared president george w. bush ’ s iraq strategy with hitler ’ s , schröder and his government have become persona non grata inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld testifies on capitol hill sept .
19 , 2002 , before the senate armed services committee hearing on iraq .
rumsfeld says the target of a u.s. military attack on iraq would be saddam hussein 's narrow power base , not the country 's civilian infrastructure .
-lrb- ap photo / dennis cook -rrb- bush has yet to call schröder to congratulate him on his victory and us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- renewed his accusation on monday that the relationship had been “ poisoned . ” relationship " intact , " says chancellor with the heat of the tightest election battle in germany ’ s postwar history behind them , schröder and fischer have now begun trying to ease the tension that has increased between the historically-close transatlantic neighbors . the relationship between berlin and washington is “ intact ” said schröder , who on monday accepted the resignation of the offending cabinet member , justice minister herta daübler-gmelin .
his foreign minister , who is believed to have support in washington , seemed to strike a conciliatory note as well . " america is a guarantor of peace and security , " fischer said .
" the united states is our most important partner and we want to further develop the traditionally good path of our relations . " easier said than done , say those working to build the transatlantic relationship . schröder ’ s unflinching refusal to support a us-led invasion of iraq – with or without a united nations mandate – has caused serious , long-term damage to us-german relations , they say . loss of support part of gradual trend “ he ’ s messed it up so badly , ” said andrea mehrlaender , director of the checkpoint charlie foundation in berlin , of schröder . “ he needs to do something and do something before christmas .
and a plain letter is not enough . ” rather than an exception , merhlaender saw schröder ’ s stance as part of a gradual movement taking place in germany ’ s political establishment . in lobbying for money for the bilateral projects the foundation sponsors , merhlaender says she has faced more closed doors since the social democrats took over power from the conservative , pro-american christian democratic union , in berlin . “ ideology-wise , the spd party program has never been pro-american in any way , ” mehrlaender said in an interview .
“ i mean , it ’ s not outspokenly anti-american .
but it has always been more leftist and critical of the us . ” so when a center-right government in washington came to power in 2000 , friction was bound to develop with the center-left red-green coalition . " badly bruised " relationship “ from the outset , these are not ideal partners , ” said dr. jeffrey gedmin , director of the conservative aspen institute in berlin .
but independent of the ideological differences , gedmin says the “ re-negotiation ” of the german-american relationship has been the most obvious point of divide between the two nations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . “ you have a re-negotiation of the relationship where the german side , now united , now sovereign , wants more respect , more voice and more insurance , ” he told dw-world .
“ and that ’ s normal .
that ’ s healthy . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor gerhard schroeder of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- flashes a smile during a press conference at the party 's headquarter in berlin on monday , sept .

but schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- “ overplayed his hand ” with his election rhetoric , gedmin said . “ it ’ s not that the sky is falling , the relationship has more at stake than just iraq , ” said gedmin .
“ but i think it ’ s badly bruised . ” analysts are suggesting schröder or fischer pay a visit to washington soon to iron things out .
gedmin thinks schröder should hustle to make germany 's iraq opposition a non-issue . " like the berlin weather , he will have to dampen this , " gedmin said .

they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . chancellor gerhard schröder may be back in office , but the wafer-thin majority of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- together with the greens has made the business community uneasy .
european bourses edged lower on monday and frankfurt 's dax index slipped 3.3 percent following news that the spd-green coalition would remain in power with a slim majority after a tight race .
in particular , traders were nervous about automobile stocks , fearing that the green party could force through new environmental taxes .
volkswagen slipped 1.2 percent and daimlerchrysler fell 1 percent monday morning .
the greens were the surprise winner on sunday , gaining 1.9 points to 8.6 percent and saving the red-green coalition 's majority . schröder 's spd fell 2.4 points to 38.5 percent , while the conservatives gained 3.4 points to 38.5 percent and the liberal free democrats gained just 7.4 percent .
radical change needed though industry leaders reacted warily about the spd-green government , they agreed that the government needs to act quickly to bring about a radical change in the floundering german economy .

reneging on promises made in 1998 when he was elected , chancellor schröder was unable to bring down unemployment levels that spiraled beyond the 4 million mark during his last four-year tenure .
economic woes were compounded by a general recession in germany and sluggish growth following the september 11 attacks and a slowdown of the world economy .
a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and an embarrassing labour market scandal earlier this year stepped up pressure on schröder to urgently address economic issues .
it was hardly surprising then that the spd-greens plunged into the election campaign making the economy a top priority . months before the election , schröder set up a panel of experts headed by volkswagen executive peter hartz to push through changes to germany ’ s tax and benefits system .
but the focus on the economy was short-lived .
other events such as last month ’ s devastating floods and schröder ’ s unrelenting stance against american policy towards iraq saw economic issues sidelined in the run-up to the elections .
economic lessons to be drawn employers now agree that lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the spd-led coalition over the past four years .
" words must now be followed by action , " said hans-joachim körber , chief executive of metro , germany ’ s largest retailer , after the poll results .
" top of the list are the simplification of the tax system , a clear reduction of non-wage labour costs and reform of the over-stretched social security system , flexibility in the labour market and a qualitative improvement of our education system , " he said .
those demands were echoed across the board by heads of companies .
hans peter keitel , chief executive of hochtief , the construction group , called for an acceleration in privatisations .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 23.09.2002 how to repair a " badly bruised " relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , joschka , trouble on the horizon with a heated , anti-american campaign behind him , chancellor schröder is eager to smooth things out with washington .
transatlantic experts say he has his work cut out for him . the two couldn ’ t have been happier . with arms on each other ’ s shoulders chancellor gerhard schröder and his green foreign minister , joschka fischer , announced the continuation of their red-green coalition government in the wee hours of the morning in berlin on monday .
their informal speeches were punctuated by cheers and whoops from the raucous crowd gathered outside of the social democratic party headquarters , who had stayed to watch the two claim victory in germany ’ s cliffhanger election . the reaction in washington has been more subdued .
since coming out strongly against american policy on iraq and since a newspaper alleged one of his cabinet members compared president george w. bush ’ s iraq strategy with hitler ’ s , schröder and his government have become persona non grata inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld testifies on capitol hill sept .
19 , 2002 , before the senate armed services committee hearing on iraq .
rumsfeld says the target of a u.s. military attack on iraq would be saddam hussein 's narrow power base , not the country 's civilian infrastructure .
-lrb- ap photo / dennis cook -rrb- bush has yet to call schröder to congratulate him on his victory and us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- renewed his accusation on monday that the relationship had been “ poisoned . ” relationship " intact , " says chancellor with the heat of the tightest election battle in germany ’ s postwar history behind them , schröder and fischer have now begun trying to ease the tension that has increased between the historically-close transatlantic neighbors . the relationship between berlin and washington is “ intact ” said schröder , who on monday accepted the resignation of the offending cabinet member , justice minister herta daübler-gmelin .
his foreign minister , who is believed to have support in washington , seemed to strike a conciliatory note as well . " america is a guarantor of peace and security , " fischer said .
" the united states is our most important partner and we want to further develop the traditionally good path of our relations . " easier said than done , say those working to build the transatlantic relationship . schröder ’ s unflinching refusal to support a us-led invasion of iraq – with or without a united nations mandate – has caused serious , long-term damage to us-german relations , they say . loss of support part of gradual trend “ he ’ s messed it up so badly , ” said andrea mehrlaender , director of the checkpoint charlie foundation in berlin , of schröder . “ he needs to do something and do something before christmas .
and a plain letter is not enough . ” rather than an exception , merhlaender saw schröder ’ s stance as part of a gradual movement taking place in germany ’ s political establishment . in lobbying for money for the bilateral projects the foundation sponsors , merhlaender says she has faced more closed doors since the social democrats took over power from the conservative , pro-american christian democratic union , in berlin . “ ideology-wise , the spd party program has never been pro-american in any way , ” mehrlaender said in an interview .
“ i mean , it ’ s not outspokenly anti-american .
but it has always been more leftist and critical of the us . ” so when a center-right government in washington came to power in 2000 , friction was bound to develop with the center-left red-green coalition . " badly bruised " relationship “ from the outset , these are not ideal partners , ” said dr. jeffrey gedmin , director of the conservative aspen institute in berlin .
but independent of the ideological differences , gedmin says the “ re-negotiation ” of the german-american relationship has been the most obvious point of divide between the two nations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . “ you have a re-negotiation of the relationship where the german side , now united , now sovereign , wants more respect , more voice and more insurance , ” he told dw-world .
“ and that ’ s normal .
that ’ s healthy . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor gerhard schroeder of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- flashes a smile during a press conference at the party 's headquarter in berlin on monday , sept .
23 , 2002 .
after the final results schroeder has won the germany 's elections general and will continue the coalition with the greens .
but schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- “ overplayed his hand ” with his election rhetoric , gedmin said . “ it ’ s not that the sky is falling , the relationship has more at stake than just iraq , ” said gedmin .
“ but i think it ’ s badly bruised . ” analysts are suggesting schröder or fischer pay a visit to washington soon to iron things out .
gedmin thinks schröder should hustle to make germany 's iraq opposition a non-issue . " like the berlin weather , he will have to dampen this , " gedmin said .
" he will have to make it as calm and boring as humanely possible over the next couple of months . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery dw-world 's up-to-date special section on the german federal elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 23.09.2002 election outcome hinged on third parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's unexpected success sunday helped secure a second government term for chancellor gerhard schröder .
the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .
as members of parliament of a party that is not officially represented , neither petra pau , who is currently the pds ’ s deputy chairwoman , nor gersine lötzsch will have the ability to submit legislation , to introduce issues for debate on the floor or to vote on drafts of legislation when they are still at committee level .
in other words , they will have literally no chance of putting their fingerprints on the laws passed during the bundestag ’ s next legislative period . speaking in berlin on monday , roland claus , who is head of the pds ’ s parliamentary group , said the party is considering calling for changes in leadership as a result of the poor showing .
however , pds chairwoman gabi zimmer has said she will not offer her resignation . the loss dealt a particularly heavy blow to the more than 200 employees of the pds in the bundestag , who will now become statistics in germany 's swollen unemployment roster . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

and a plain letter is not enough . ” rather than an exception , merhlaender saw schröder ’ s stance as part of a gradual movement taking place in germany ’ s political establishment . in lobbying for money for the bilateral projects the foundation sponsors , merhlaender says she has faced more closed doors since the social democrats took over power from the conservative , pro-american christian democratic union , in berlin . “ ideology-wise , the spd party program has never been pro-american in any way , ” mehrlaender said in an interview .
“ i mean , it ’ s not outspokenly anti-american .

" badly bruised " relationship “ from the outset , these are not ideal partners , ” said dr. jeffrey gedmin , director of the conservative aspen institute in berlin .
but independent of the ideological differences , gedmin says the “ re-negotiation ” of the german-american relationship has been the most obvious point of divide between the two nations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . “ you have a re-negotiation of the relationship where the german side , now united , now sovereign , wants more respect , more voice and more insurance , ” he told dw-world .

the social democrats and the christian democratic union may be germany 's most powerful parties , but it was the smaller parties that played the decisive role in sunday ’ s election . joschka fischer had good reason to gleam on monday . his party had set out to get a modest 8 percent of the vote , but even that seemed ambitious considering the greens were hovering at around 5 percent in several polls only a few months ago .
the dismal performance of the liberal free democrats and the defection of supporters of east germany 's former communist party to the social democrats and greens ultimately secured a second term for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . " many considered it unrealistic , but our goal was to achieve over eight percent … and we 've certainly managed that , " german foreign minister and leading greens candidate fischer said as results showed his party would win 8.6 percent of the seats in the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament . though it was only a 1.9 percent gain over the party ’ s 1998 election result , it was the greatest showing in the party ’ s 22-year history and it proved to be the decisive factor in schröder ’ s reelection . analysts attributed the party ’ s success to fischer , germany ’ s most-popular politician , the party ’ s swift and effective response to severe flooding in eastern germany in july and its stance against a u.s.-led military invasion of iraq .
both of the latter issues helped the greens and social democrats win the support of dovish voters who otherwise might have turned to the party of democratic socialism . for the first time ever , the greens tied their campaign to a single candidate - joschka fischer , the wildly popular politician who enjoys a popularity rating of 81 percent .
the german polling firm wahlen attributed the greens ' gains to the fischer-focused campaign . the party ’ s reinforced standing provides it with a strong edge as it begins negotiations with the social democrats to enter into a second-term government .
news agencies are reporting green party sources saying that the party will seek greater responsibilities for the ministries it already runs – the foreign ministry , the environmental ministry and the consumer protection and agricultural ministry - and possibly a fourth ministry posting . but the social democrats were less committal .
“ one more post for the greens won ’ t be automatic , ” spd general secretary franz müntefering told the radio station berlin inforadio on monday .
but he did n't ruled out the possibility , either .
he said he hoped to wrap up negotiations for a new government within three weeks . a dark day for liberals , former communists there were no cheers to be heard at the campaign headquarters of the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism on monday . despite its creative " 18 percent " campaign and charismatic chairman guido westerwelle , who made campaign appearances in a blue-and-yellow mobile home he called the " guidomobile , “ the party only managed to gain 7.4 percent of the vote .
even though the party secured 1.2 percent more votes than in the 1998 election , it was far below the 12 percent the party had reached in polls just a few weeks earlier .
the party had been badly damaged by anti-israeli comments and a vicious personal attack on the head of germany ’ s most-influential jewish organization made by the party ’ s deputy chairman , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also the party ’ s state leader in north rhine-westphalia , accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of fueling anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style " last may .
his spiteful words angered many germans , drew undesirable international criticism and led the party to fall in popularity polls .
möllemann stunned germans again last week when he sent a campaign mailing to voters in north rhine-westphalia critical of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and friedman .
senior party leaders distanced themselves from möllemann and on sunday demanded his resignation , which he tendered a day later .
but the party ’ s honorary chairman also criticized westerwelle for the party ’ s poor showing , noting that the fdp had slipped in the polls prior to möllemann ’ s latest outburst . leadership changes expected for pds with its very survival on a federal level now in question , monday could hardly have been grimmer for the pds , the successor to east germany ’ s communist party . the pds neither gained the 5 percent nor the three direct mandates that ensure a party with official representation in parliament .
the pds has been in a downward trend since the resignation of its intellectual leader , gregor gysi , earlier this summer in the lufthansa bonus miles scandal .
and it ’ s dismal 4 percent showing on sunday ensured it would not be represented in the bundestag . support for the pds dropped sharply in the eastern states , it ’ s traditional stronghold .
in 1998 , the party secured 21.6 percent of eastern germans ’ votes , but this year support fell to 16.9 percent . two pds members did win seats in the bundestag through direct mandates , but their powers will be limited .
as members of parliament of a party that is not officially represented , neither petra pau , who is currently the pds ’ s deputy chairwoman , nor gersine lötzsch will have the ability to submit legislation , to introduce issues for debate on the floor or to vote on drafts of legislation when they are still at committee level .
in other words , they will have literally no chance of putting their fingerprints on the laws passed during the bundestag ’ s next legislative period . speaking in berlin on monday , roland claus , who is head of the pds ’ s parliamentary group , said the party is considering calling for changes in leadership as a result of the poor showing .
however , pds chairwoman gabi zimmer has said she will not offer her resignation . the loss dealt a particularly heavy blow to the more than 200 employees of the pds in the bundestag , who will now become statistics in germany 's swollen unemployment roster . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

how have the parties done ?
chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- won 38.5 % of the vote , level with opposition challenger edmund stoiber 's cdu / csu .
this is a drop of almost 2.5 % from the spd 's showing four years ago , and is therefore disappointing for mr schroeder .
however , given the party 's poor showing in opinion polls during the run-up to the election , there must be relief in spd ranks that it did not lose any more ground .
the greens - who formed a coalition with the spd in the last government - are delighted to have come in third , with over 8 % .
the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , after boasting they could get over 18 % had a disastrous showing at around 7 % .
and the former communist pds , which had been seen as a potential power broker , had a poor showing , gaining under 5 % of the vote .
although two of its deputies have gained seats , the party will not be able to function as a fully-fledged faction .
who will form a government ?
the governing coalition will be the same as before the elections : the red-green combination of the spd and the environmentalists .
chancellor schroeder has been saved by the greens , after the spd 's drop in support .
in coalition with them , he will have a narrow majority of 11 seats in the new bundestag .
coalition talks will soon get under way , with the greens ' good results giving them more leverage to demand influential positions in a new administration .
although mr stoiber 's conservatives did as well as the spd , he was let down by the fdp 's crash in support .
how does the election work ?
voters cast two ballots , one for a candidate in their constituency , and one for a party .
the party vote determines the overall division of seats in parliament - which has at least 598 seats - under a system of proportional representation .
a party may win 65 constituency seats , say , out of a total of 299 , but then get this figure topped up by virtue of winning more than 10 % of the party vote .
to be represented in parliament , a party must cross the 5 % barrier .
extra seats are added to parliament if parties win more constituency seats in parliament than they are entitled to under the party vote .
this is one of the reasons it takes so long to work out exactly who has the most seats in an election as tight as this one .
what issues were at the forefront of voters ' minds ?
in august the disastrous floods that hit the east and north of the country , causing some 15 million euros of damage , were the number one concern .
it was chancellor gerhard schroeder 's confident handling of the crisis that probably did most to bring about the spd 's recovery in the polls .
but by the first week of september the signs were that unemployment and the shaky state of the german economy had returned to the top of the list of hot election issues .
what is the difference between the social democrats and the conservatives ?
to judge by their manifestoes , not much .
both parties aim to capture the centre ground , and their programmes are correspondingly middle-of-the-road .
this election is more about the personalities of the two main candidates , gerhard schroeder , and his bavarian challenger , edmund stoiber .
it was the first in german history to have featured presidential-style television debates .
mr stoiber presented himself as the man who can repeat bavaria 's economic success at national level .
mr schroeder relied more on his personal charm - which contrasts with mr stoiber 's formal manner - and his skill as a media performer .
why has foreign policy become so important ?
mr schroeder won votes by speaking out against us plans for military action against iraq .
but he was criticised by the conservatives for wrecking the us-german relationship - especially after a row over alleged comments by justice minister herta daeubler-gmelin apparently comparing us president george w bush to adolf hitler .
the us has reacted angrily to the reported comments .
why are voters worried about the economy ?
mr schroeder promised to get unemployment down to 3.5 million , but after some early successes , it has risen back above four million , almost to the level it was when he took over as chancellor from the veteran cdu leader , helmut kohl .
german economic growth , expected to be well under 1 % this year , is among the lowest in europe .
meanwhile , germany 's budget deficit is in danger of exceeding the agreed eurozone limit of 3 % - as brussels publicly warned it earlier this year .

the association of chief police officers in scotland -lrb- acpos -rrb- said that the current laws and voluntary codes of practice are outdated .
it wants to see tighter vetting procedures of retailers and an increase in the price of the sellers ' certificate from the current level of £ 13 .
acpos also wants training certificates to be introduced for those selling fireworks and a more " positive " policy of prosecuting offenders .
a positive prosecution policy for offenders needs to be adopted david mellor fife constabulary the legislative framework is currently controlled by the fireworks -lrb- safety -rrb- regulations 1997 and the explosives acts of 1875 and 1923 .
david mellor , fife 's deputy chief constable and spokesperson for acpos , said these laws were " certainly past their sell-by date " .
" we firmly believe that the regulations governing the manufacture , storage and retail sale of fireworks are in desperate need of review .
" in meeting modern needs they simply do not go nearly far enough .
true cost " anyone can apply for registration to allow them to sell fireworks , for instance .
" this costs just £ 13 , there is no provision for refusal or revocation of an application and it remains valid for 12 months .
why all year when there is only one 5 november ? "
mr mellor said that the current laws make conditions difficult for police forces around the country .
he said that in many cases fireworks were being set off indiscriminately or thrown at people .
in fife last year police dealt with 745 calls from the public relating to the abuse of fireworks - 18 in september , 502 in october and 225 in november .
mr mellor said the case for tightening the laws was now overwhelming .
police said fireworks pose a real threat " there needs to be stringent vetting of sellers to ensure that those applying for a certificate are of good character , " he said .
" applicants for a certificate to sell fireworks should be required to show need before being granted a certificate .
" a positive prosecution policy for offenders needs to be adopted and there is a specific need for approved certified training for those involved in the handling and safety of fireworks . "
mr mellor said police forces believed that only people with training certificates should be allowed to buy and sell fireworks .
' illegal fireworks ' he also called for more stringent security requirements for the storage of fireworks and legislation covering the periods during which they can be supplied or sold .
mr mellor added : " there is , of course , some support for a complete ban on the sale of domestic fireworks but it is recognised that this would be extremely difficult to enforce .
" alternative sources of fireworks would remain available - the internet , europe and self-manufacture being just some - so there is a real danger that a black market in illegal fireworks could spring up . "

most parties were too small to contest more than a handful of the 299 constituencies .
only five parties attempted anything like national representation .
social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- : governing party , in coalition with greens since last election in 1998 .
gerhard schroeder is standing for re-election as chancellor .
spd facts oldest party new " business-friendly " image failed to reduce unemployment against attack on iraq greens as coalition partner spd is the oldest party in germany with traditionally strong links with the labour movement .
schroeder has tried to broaden its appeal by cultivating a more " business-friendly " image .
he has dubbed the spd the " new centre " .
his major problem has been unemployment .
in 1998 - when nearly 4.1m were out of work - schroeder said he should be judged by how well he could cut that figure .
by 2000 it had gone down to 3.6m.
now the numbers have crept back to more than 4m .
the spd looks set to lose support on any assessment of this record , but the party says that full employment is still the central goal of its labour policy .
it also wants to ensure lasting economic growth and social justice .
schroeder 's prompt handling of the consequences of this summer 's flooding in eastern germany has been popular , as has his refusal to commit german troops to any possible us-led attack on iraq .
having lagged behind edmund stoiber for months , schroeder has closed the gap in the final weeks of the campaign .
he says he wants to continue the coalition with the greens and has ruled out any contact with the reformed communist pds .
christian democrats -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- : in opposition since 1998 , when their leader helmut kohl lost to schroeder .
the cdu represents the whole of germany except the southern state of bavaria , which is the domain of its " sister party " , the csu .
cdu / csu facts opposition since 1998 edmund stoiber from bavaria wants lower taxes favours nuclear energy supports family values , individual responsibility attack on iraq only with un backing a party funding scandal involving kohl led to a crisis of confidence and personnel in the cdu from 1999 onwards .
its new leader angela merkel was unable to mend the damage sufficiently .

most parties were too small to contest more than a handful of the 299 constituencies .
only five parties attempted anything like national representation .
social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- : governing party , in coalition with greens since last election in 1998 .
gerhard schroeder is standing for re-election as chancellor .
spd facts oldest party new " business-friendly " image failed to reduce unemployment against attack on iraq greens as coalition partner spd is the oldest party in germany with traditionally strong links with the labour movement .
schroeder has tried to broaden its appeal by cultivating a more " business-friendly " image .
he has dubbed the spd the " new centre " .
his major problem has been unemployment .
in 1998 - when nearly 4.1m were out of work - schroeder said he should be judged by how well he could cut that figure .
by 2000 it had gone down to 3.6m.
now the numbers have crept back to more than 4m .
schroeder bounced back after being behind in the polls the spd looks set to lose support on any assessment of this record , but the party says that full employment is still the central goal of its labour policy .
it also wants to ensure lasting economic growth and social justice .
schroeder 's prompt handling of the consequences of this summer 's flooding in eastern germany has been popular , as has his refusal to commit german troops to any possible us-led attack on iraq .
having lagged behind edmund stoiber for months , schroeder has closed the gap in the final weeks of the campaign .
he says he wants to continue the coalition with the greens and has ruled out any contact with the reformed communist pds .
christian democrats -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- : in opposition since 1998 , when their leader helmut kohl lost to schroeder .
the cdu represents the whole of germany except the southern state of bavaria , which is the domain of its " sister party " , the csu .
cdu / csu facts opposition since 1998 edmund stoiber from bavaria wants lower taxes favours nuclear energy supports family values , individual responsibility attack on iraq only with un backing a party funding scandal involving kohl led to a crisis of confidence and personnel in the cdu from 1999 onwards .
its new leader angela merkel was unable to mend the damage sufficiently .

an institute of welsh politics survey found support for an institution like scotland 's has doubled in the last five years to 40 % .
voters want the welsh assembly to have a greater say than westminster over the way wales is governed , the survey claims .
welsh assembly responsibilities agriculture historic buildings culture economic development environment education health highways housing industry local govt .
social services sport & leisure tourism town & country planning transport & roads welsh language academics who drew up the survey at the university of wales , aberystwyth , have been tracking the electorate 's attitude to their form of government for the last five years .
but dr richard wyn jones , from aberystwyth university who worked on the report , said the change in attitude appeared to have nothing to do with voter satisfaction with the job done so far .
" it is not because people think the assembly is doing a fantastic job or has transformed their lives or could be doing better , " said dr jones .
" what we find is that pre-1997 , expectations of devolution were really low . "
dr jones said those people canvassed were asked to give their response to full independence , scottish-style parliament , keeping the status quo and returning to pre-devolution .
" there is a big shift going on from people not wanting any devolution at all to those who want a full-blown parliament .
" people who voted yes thought it was going to do fantastic things and those that voted no thought it would be absolutely awful .
" those that voted no seem to have gotten used to it , it has become part of the furniture , and it seems to be the feeling is that if we are going to have it , let 's do a proper job of it . "
but tory monmouth am david davies said he noted on the streets that feelings ran against a full parliament .
" we do not want to force on the people of wales a parliament people do not want .
there are people within my party that have differing views . "
the " yes " camp scraped through wales ' 1997 devolution referendum with a tiny majority .
since its inception at cardiff bay in 1999 , the welsh assembly has struggled to make significant headlines - the most radically divergent policies from westminster have clearly come from the current education minister .
several members have voiced their frustration at what they are able to do within the devolution settlement passed in the government of wales act .
the new survey indicates opposition to devolution - so prevalent in 1997 - is clearly on the wane , replaced by hunger for more power .
hungry for power but the question of just what institution the welsh want appears to remain far from settled .
thirty-nine percent of survey respondents wanted a parliament like that in edinburgh - a rise of 19 % in five years .
and support for the current assembly is slightly down at 26 % .
just 12 % of people want independence - a goal now supported by none of the mainstream political parties in wales .
the scottish parliament in edinburgh can raise taxes and make new laws .
plaid cymru called for parity for wales at its party conference friday .
even labour assembly ministers like carwyn jones have expressed frustration with westminster 's remote control on subjects like animal disease control .
the liberal democrats also favour further devolution but welsh conservatives are cooler to the idea - they want the current assembly to prove itself .
powers review with a clear majority , 56 % of voters wanted the welsh assembly - and not the uk government - to have the greatest say in the governance of wales .
lord richard of ammanford is currently chairing an independent commission reviewing whether cardiff needs more power .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : the cost of flooding news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : business news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business e-commerce economy market data entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk monday , 23 september , 2002 , 07:08 gmt 08:08 uk q & a : the cost of flooding two years ago , parts of the uk were hit badly by flooding , lives were lost and many houses and businesses still have not recovered .
and last summer saw some of the worst flooding in central europe for more than a century .
bbc news online looks at the current state of flood defence and asks , with insurers getting twitchy about claims , are large parts of the country about to become uninsurable .
is much of the uk in danger of flooding ?
the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- estimates that 10 % of the land area of the uk is in danger of flooding .
up to 2 million homes and 185,000 businesses are at risk from flooding .
despite the environment agency trying to increase flood awareness many people living in flood plains are still not aware that they are at risk .
what about flood defences ?
government spending was stepped up in the aftermath of the 2000 floods .
but according to last july 's spending review the really big increases in inland flood defence spending will not kick in until 2004-05 .
to speed up work now , the government has introduced new flood planning procedures .
but all this could be too little too late for some insurers , as from 2003 they may start cancelling policies on homes at risk .
on what grounds ?
put simply , insurers are fed up with picking up the bill for flooding .
the floods of 2000 are estimated to have cost the industry £ 1bn .
as a result , the association of british insurers -lrb- abi -rrb- came to an agreement with the government that in return for concerted action on flood defence insurers would continue to offer cover to high-risk areas .
however , the abi put a deadline of 2003 on this agreement .
with flood defences incomplete the abi has advised insurers that although they should aim to offer insurance wherever possible from the new year premiums charged will reflect the risk of flooding .
are all people at risk of flooding in danger of having their insurance cancelled ?
the uk 's biggest insurer , the norwich union - which paid out £ 200m in the aftermath of the 2000 floods - claims not .
" it 's more likely that those at risk will see premiums rise or face paying high excess . "
liz kennett , told bbc news online .
however those living in areas where chronic flooding occurs will fare less well .
" a flood claim costs on average £ 10-15,000 , with some homes we ca n't keep shouldering the burden and insurance will have to be cancelled , " ms kennett said .
in addition , homeowners at most severe risk of flooding have been issued with a stark warning by the abi .
in future , insurers will take a case by case approach which may mean some homes are simply deemed uninsurable .
p > can anything be done for these households ?
the government and abi are meeting in october to discuss where to go from here .
norwich union says that new precision digital mapping means that from next year some insurers will be able to pinpoint particular homes at risk rather than simply blacklisting postcodes .
but whatever the result of new technology some homes are simply going to be seen as too high-risk to insure .
as a result , uninsurable homes are likely to become worthless .
when the flood defences when they arrive solve the problem at a stroke ?
in short , no .
many decisions to build flood defence are arrived at through a cost-benefit analysis .
put simply this means that savings have to justify the expenditure .
highly populated flood plains , such as the vale of york , have passed this test and flood defences are being built .
but less populated areas may end up without defences and possibly insurance .
so what are people in these areas to do ?
there are several options on the table .
firstly , the imposition of local taxes to raise money for flood defences has been mooted .
in addition , businesses and households in endangered communities could club together to build defences .
all in all , though , ms kennett says that the fate of those households most at risk is still yet to be decided .
" this issue is going to play a part in the discussions between the government and the insurance industry , " said ms kennett .

neurosurgery treats disorders of the nervous system including diseases of the head , brain and spine .
under the plan , morriston hospital in swansea , would lose its children 's neuro unit under the specialised health services commission for wales plans to re-locate treatment to the capital .
signatures from 103,738 people - mainly parents - were on a petition which called on the welsh assembly to scrap the plan .

it fears children 's lives could be put at risk .
the morriston unit provides surgery and care for children from across west wales .
the specialised health services commission 's recommendation is just one in a wide-ranging plan to improve care for children with rare illnesses .
it believes a move to cardiff will improve services because of easier access to cancer services and intensive care .
parents ' campaign but it has led to fierce opposition across the region .
parents believe moving all morriston 's paediatric neurosurgery would instead diminish services .
their petition - handed in by the south wales evening post newspaper - was three times larger than the weightiest ever received by welsh assembly ministers .
health minister jane hutt said she recognised the strength of feeling in the area and reassured worried parents the document would be considered .
balancing act it is a clear case of two opposing views trying to reach the same goal .
the health commission predicts an increase in instances of neurological impairments like cerebral palsy , creating a bigger need for specialised services .
it wants better rehabilitation services in south wales .
but the welsh assembly will have to balance its experts ' recommendation with parents ' fears .

of 2,400 , only 30 have reopened so far , and prices are at least four times higher .
the cafe closures came soon after police raids on major chinese internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- , followed by partial service shut-downs , enforcement of filters and stricter oversight of chat rooms and bulletin boards .
in september , the authorities shifted to blocking overseas portals google and altavista , two of the most popular .
filtering growth ?
human rights activists have long worried about china 's digital censorship , but should economists care , too ?
" you have a lot of talent , not to mention money , that is being directed into controlling rather than stimulating the use of the web , " says ken dewoskin , a partner at accountants pricewaterhousecoopers in beijing .

" it 's like an enormous tax in terms of time and cost that is introduced into the use of the internet for research ... everything is just slow as molasses , " he says .
china 's elderly patriarchs see censorship as justified by the need for social stability to grow the economy and meet the needs of their huge population .
but many of today 's internet billionaires started out as insubordinate slackers , similar to the high school students who crowded beijing 's internet bars and - allegedly - neglected their schoolwork .
" the really smart internet entrepreneurs come out of the teenage gaming parlours and compulsive teenage activity , " says mr dewoskin .
booming but china 's internet expansion programme is flourishing .
the country claims the world 's second biggest online community , and economic growth was a healthy 7 % last year .
the leadership wants information technology to provide 5 % of china 's gross domestic product by 2005 , though analysts view 3 % as more feasible .
analysts believe the latest internet crackdown on cafes and isps is about creating a framework of controls within which a sanitised sector can grow .
" it 's about leverage , " says duncan clark , managing director of beijing-based it analysts bda china .
digital spying is part of china 's online economy that has received major investment .
human rights activists believe the effort employs 30,000 people .
since 2000 , they say , china 's web filtering has overtaken saudi arabia 's in scale .
the firewall now surrounds the country , not just a few cities .
it works by scanning for suspect words as digital documents cross the international gateways and needs big banks of servers .
" dozens if not hundreds of software engineers , " are involved , says stephen hsu , chairman and co-founder of california-based software designer safeweb .
he should know .
safeweb monitors china 's web spies in order to help chinese surfers dodge censorship and gain access to blocked foreign websites .
guerrilla warfare it has licensed its anti-blocking software , triangleboy , to the cia , whose venture capital arm in-q-tel made a $ 1m investment in the company .
triangleboy works by turning pcs outside china into gateways to proxy servers and emailing real-time lists of live proxy addresses to take surfers over china 's firewall .
ironically , professor hsu admits safeweb itself has discussed controls on its censorship-busting software in order to gain access to us public funds for a proposed trial of its software in tandem with broadcaster voice of america .
safeweb " agreed with voa to put a filter on the server side " to screen out pornography , said professor hsu , acknowledging that homosexual rights sites could be blanked too if they are deemed to have " adult content " .
" in dealing with the political world here in the us , in so far as those resources are going to come from the us government we have to be realistic , " he said .
who helped ?
so how much is china spending on digital spying and censorship ?
it 's impossible to know because the same technology is imported by multinationals to give their local plants the same protection against viruses and hackers as elsewhere , says bda china 's mr clark .
" there is a legitimate inflow for dual use technology , " he points out , estimating the chinese market at approaching $ 100m a year .
sales by international telecoms firms to build china 's internet backbones are huge and well documented - $ 1bn in 2001 for cisco systems alone , but every global it engineer is in china .
it seems likely much of the technology being used by china 's security services was designed and supplied by foreign firms .
speculation centres on how knowingly they did it , whether they modified it .
in mr dewoskin 's view , the ties between the it sector and intelligence services are so deep and long-standing that " 99 % of it is absolutely common firewall technology that is used by governments around the world " .
meanwhile , the communist party seems confident that acceptable commercial savvy will always find ways to flourish within the firewall .
maybe they are right .
with investment from uk bank hsbc , mr zeng has refocused sparkice as an e-commerce supplier for foreign retailers trying to source cheap , high quality goods in china .

safeweb " agreed with voa to put a filter on the server side " to screen out pornography , said professor hsu , acknowledging that homosexual rights sites could be blanked too if they are deemed to have " adult content " .
" in dealing with the political world here in the us , in so far as those resources are going to come from the us government we have to be realistic , " he said .
who helped ?
so how much is china spending on digital spying and censorship ?
it 's impossible to know because the same technology is imported by multinationals to give their local plants the same protection against viruses and hackers as elsewhere , says bda china 's mr clark .
" there is a legitimate inflow for dual use technology , " he points out , estimating the chinese market at approaching $ 100m a year .
sales by international telecoms firms to build china 's internet backbones are huge and well documented - $ 1bn in 2001 for cisco systems alone , but every global it engineer is in china .

users buying a legitimate copy of bounce will find a 13-digit number inside the packaging .
this serial number can be used on the group 's website to entitle the user to special privileges , including tickets for concerts before they go on general release , unseen footage of the band and downloads of live versions of songs .
it is the latest in a long line of attempts by the music industry to crack down on pirated cds and the practice of downloading free music from the internet .
value-added according to larry mattera , head of new media at bon jovi 's record label island def jam , the band wanted to find imaginative ways of persuading fans to buy legitimate copies of their new album .
" we need to ensure there is enough value in the cd itself to drive purchases , " he told the bbc 's go digital programme .
" there is value in music but that has got lost in the last few years with the advent of the internet and the ability to file-share . "
but this may not be enough to stop music pirates .
copies of bounce are already available online , with thousands of people downloading it .
the album is topping the download charts on one site which offers a guide to pirated music .
fighting pirates the music industry has come down hard on file-sharing sites such as napster that allow users to swap music over the internet .
it has proved a game of cat-and-mouse however as every time one is closed down , another opens .
the music industry blames a fall in the sales of cds on the advent of pirated music although a survey by us-based analysts forrester found no evidence that consumers of digital music bought less cds .
professional pirates manufacture large numbers of cds in pressing plants based in south east asia , eastern europe and latin america .
cd burning among amateur music fans is rife particularly in germany .

users buying a legitimate copy of bounce will find a 13-digit number inside the packaging .
this serial number can be used on the group 's website to entitle the user to special privileges , including tickets for concerts before they go on general release , unseen footage of the band and downloads of live versions of songs .
it is the latest in a long line of attempts by the music industry to crack down on pirated cds and the practice of downloading free music from the internet .
value-added according to larry mattera , head of new media at bon jovi 's record label island def jam , the band wanted to find imaginative ways of persuading fans to buy legitimate copies of their new album .
cd sales have slumped " we need to ensure there is enough value in the cd itself to drive purchases , " he told the bbc 's go digital programme .
" there is value in music but that has got lost in the last few years with the advent of the internet and the ability to file-share . "
but this may not be enough to stop music pirates .
copies of bounce are already available online , with thousands of people downloading it .
the album is topping the download charts on one site which offers a guide to pirated music .
fighting pirates the music industry has come down hard on file-sharing sites such as napster that allow users to swap music over the internet .
it has proved a game of cat-and-mouse however as every time one is closed down , another opens .
the music industry blames a fall in the sales of cds on the advent of pirated music although a survey by us-based analysts forrester found no evidence that consumers of digital music bought less cds .
professional pirates manufacture large numbers of cds in pressing plants based in south east asia , eastern europe and latin america .
cd burning among amateur music fans is rife particularly in germany .
music labels are experimenting with copy protection software to defy the pirates .
a previous attempt by bon jovi 's label to embed extra features into legitimate cds was a failure because the information was contained in the disc itself meaning it showed up on pirated copies as well .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- would you pay more tax to ease poverty ?
news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : talking point news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point forum - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk monday , 23 september , 2002 , 08:18 gmt 09:18 uk would you pay more tax to ease poverty ?
the prime minister , tony blair has reasserted the labour party 's traditional belief in the redistribution of wealth , power and opportunity .
in a speech at a north london school on wednesday to mark the publication of the government 's annual child poverty report , mr blair also countered growing criticism of his government 's commitment to tackling poverty .
the report estimates 1.4 million youngsters have been rescued from low incomes since 1997 and reveals teenage pregnancies have fallen by 6 % .
previously , labour ministers have often steered clear of talking about redistribution because of fears it means higher taxes .
do you feel that goverment policies have helped to reduce poverty over the past five years ?
would you be prepared to pay increased taxes to improve conditions for britain 's poor ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
i would much prefer to stick to voluntary contributions linda , uk i have always been actively involved in the charity world and have devoted much of my own resources and time to helping improve the lives of those in need .
however , i would not like to pay extra tax to help poverty alleviation as i think that the present government would be too incompetent to spend it .
in the aid world , we have ways of measuring what percentage of the donor 's contribution reaches the target after overheads and administration .
i imagine that if the government were to perform such a test , the results would be frightening .
i would much prefer to stick to voluntary contributions .
linda , uk we 've always known that labour governments want to redistribute wealth - no surprise there .
but what worries me is the suggestion that " opportunity " will also be redistributed now .
whose opportunities to do what will be taken away , and given to whom ?
are able students going to be refused university places to give them to the less able ?
is n't this the logical extension of our progressive tax system ?
jan dawson , uk altruism is way down the list of priorities in human nature simon d , england nothing will change .
it 's not really the government 's fault though .
it 's all down to human nature .
being a success is part of our psyche .
the selfish gene will always win out .
altruism is way down the list of priorities in human nature .
we are designed for survival this way .
simon d , england no , i do n't want to pay more tax .
as a middle income , single gay man i pay and subsidize too many people already .
i live in s east where i ca n't afford to buy a flat so i simply do not want to give more .
there are plenty of other sources where money can be collected by making this government spend less frivolously .
there are very few poor in england anyway .
even the beggar on the street here is rich compared to a person living in asian or south american shantytowns .
i novakovic , uk tax the rich not those in the middle ian grimley , uk any redistribution only ever seems to be from the middle classes to the poor .
the wealthy always escape , perhaps because those in power are either wealthy themselves or because of the influence the wealthy bring to bear .
tax the rich not those in the middle .
ian grimley , uk labour and tax are like strawberry and cream .
they go well together .
any excuses to raise taxes .
al , uk so i am meant to spend my whole working life bailing out the poor just so when i retire i can get a state pension that will hardly cover the cost of a pint of milk a week !
julia , uk we can talk about many issues concerning the proposed tax increases but my own feeling is that it would be pointless .
this country is so frustrating to live in that i am going to emigrate at the first opportunity .
i have absolutely no confidence in the future and have already told my children -lrb- both university educated -rrb- to also leave .
mr blair and his cohorts can go shove it !
k. white , england we need an overhaul of the benefit systems f. davies , uk where is all the tax going now ?
we need an overhaul of the benefit systems so that benefits are a stop gap and not a right or privilege that most people think they are entitled to on a permanent basis .
get more people into work , pay a decent level of wages and guess what - more income for the government without raising taxation level .
f. davies , uk what about corporate tax ?
multinational corporations make billions in profit , and yet still get huge tax breaks at our expense .
but our ' fearless ' politicians are afraid of upsetting their big business pals to do anything about it .
ben drake , york , uk to all those who say they would n't begrudge paying extra tax , i ask : what are you waiting for ?
there 's nothing stopping you from writing out a cheque to the inland revenue .
henry case , uk i 'm amazed at all these people who feel they need to pay more tax .
it 's so simple : they can just write a cheque to " hm treasury " for however much they feel they 've short-changed gordon brown .
no need to annoy the rest of us with all this political whining .
mike holmes , scotland the only way to reduce poverty is to increase benefit levels to the level where people can have a dignified existence neil rogall , uk the only way to reduce poverty is to increase benefit levels to the level where people can have a dignified existence .
the money that blair spends on armaments and war could be used to bring millions out of poverty and despair .
in addition we need to go back to a situation where the rich -lrb- not the middle classes -rrb- are taxed heavily - those who have gained their wealth by profiting from others labour both here and abroad are forced to contribute to the society that has made them rich .
if only tony blair would do that - instead he offers nothing but privatisation , neo-liberalism , and authoritarianism .
and of course war .
neil rogall , uk neil rogall , uk : dignity does not come from money , it comes from working for a living .
as others have said the key is education , a good education will get you a good job and good wages .
high beneit levels just means your first job pays for the baby sitter and you are no better off at the end of the day .
michael pearce , uk to neil rogall , what a genius idea that is , then all of us can give up work and live on the generous handouts you propose .
none of us needs to ever work again ! !
on second thought , maybe there is a slight flaw in this plan ?
bankrupting the uk , but i suppose as you obviously live in cloud cuckoo land that wont be a problem for you .
tim , uk when the various " stealth " taxes are taken into account -lrb- vat , national insurance - which is a tax by another name , tax on insurance , airport taxes , fuel taxes , alcohol taxes , capital gains tax , inheritance tax , stamp duty etc -rrb- are taken into account , we already pay around 65 % tax .
let the government look to its own inefficiencies and profligate waste before it tries to take still more from a population which is already one of the most heavily taxed in europe .
kate , england the 40 % tax rate should not be raised as it stands .
people on little over 30k a year , just a few thousand more than the average wage , already have to pay almost half their salary in taxes and should not penalised any further .
if anything tax rates for them should be lowered , as the jump from 22 % to 40 % is too high and a more progressive tax code introduced topping off at say 50 % for those earning over 75k .
meanwhile " sin taxes " on fatty and unhealthy food should be introduced to help curb the appalling rates of poverty amongst the poor .
it will take time to have an effect but will pay dividends in the long run .
lr , england compared to most of the other big economic countries we pay some of the lowest rates of tax .
fact !
so where will all our big earning bosses go and work if the uk raised taxes ?
germany where the highest rate of income tax is 51 % ?
france where the highest rate of income tax is 54 % ?
i guess they could go to italy where the highest rate is only 46 % !
in the netherlands the highest rate is 60 % .
plus most of these countries also pay higher rates of vat !
i wonder if all their government services are better than ours ?
food for thought !
steve , england we have to be prepared to pay our fair share of tax to improve services and quality of life of the vulnerable .
this means taxing the rich a little more and addressing their tax avoidance .
civilisation is expensive .
the vulgar personification of the inland revenue as " the taxman getting his hands on your cash " perpetuates our miserly , short-sighted attitudes .
tom phelan , uk how about some serious accountability before taking more of my hard earned cash antony , london , uk i am pretty sick of managing government wastage and inefficiency with the " quick fix " solution of yet another tax hike .
with 10 % ni contributions , 17.5 % vat , stamp duty , petrol tax , death duty , etc. plus one third of my salary gone from source .
where does it all go ?
how about some serious accountability before taking more of my hard earned cash .
they may as well incinerate half the money i currently pay over for all the good it does .
i would never agree to higher taxes until those in power prove they are using it responsibly .
antony , london , uk one aspect of poverty in the south east is that salaries no longer buy homes , and whilst this poverty trap continues we will see an increasing number of public service strikes , fire service and tube strikes could just be the beginning .
increasing interest rates and preventing people buying numerous buy-to-let properties would help to ease the problem .
tim , uk the problem is n't so much as the more well off paying tax , but making many employers pay living wage salaries .
there are too many companies out there expecting to pay £ 12,000 or less for what are quite demanding jobs .
i 'm sure such employers will bleat that they ca n't afford it , but why should the taxpayer subsidise them ?
phil cattermole , united kingdom my husband and i work over 80 hours a week between us , we do not have a car , we have given up smoking and we made a conscious decision not to have children which we felt we could not afford .
we do have a mortgage but we are considered well off because we are buying our own house .
we are fed up of continually having to bale out the " poor " - most of whom spend a lot of money on cigarettes , take away food and cars .
why does n't the government not take away child benefit from the well off people and redistribute it to the less well off people with children .
this benefit is the only benefit which is not means tested and it is given to rich and poor people alike .
marlene wodo , england i would not trust the government to distribute the money generated from higher taxation to the poor , it would simply be used to pay for their next election campaign .
so no way we pay far too much as it is for very little return , britain is still a rip off !
doug , london , uk the idea that slapping taxes on the rich will solve all the uk 's problems belongs in a student union , not in the real world !
peter , uk so apart from the 40 % i pay on my salary , the % 80 i pay on petrol , the 18 % vat , road tax , the tax on cigarettes and alcohol , how much more of my hard earned does this government want ?
and i really want to know what they spend it all on ?
rail companies are privatised , greatly reduced support for students , miniscule police force , more and more people in private healthcare ?
duncan , uk there is no need to increase the level of tax if you increase tax receipts by creating more wealth .
investing in britain , through infrastructure improvements and helping businesses .
help the poor by providing the opportunities for them to earn a good wage .
spencer dutton , brit in germany re-introduction of the highest rate tax bands for very high earners would be a good starting point steve , uk i think tax rises are a particularly grey area that most people agree are a good idea , if the money goes to the right places , and that the right people are taxed - as long as it 's not me paying .
re-introduction of the highest rate tax bands for very high earners would be a good starting point .
steve , uk does anybody realise that in the past 5 years since new labour came to power that the total tax pot has risen from £ 286 billion to nearer £ 500 billion per year .
we should all be asking where on earth all that money is going .
and then they have the cheek to demand more of our money .
gavin , uk more taxes ?
do we not pay enough already ?
i 'm a single hard working man , and i struggle every month .
i would n't expect anyone to help me out .
louis kabbani , uk the idea of paying more tax to support poor people is abhorrent james fownes , england the idea of paying more tax to support poor people is abhorrent , many of them are in the situation due to laziness and it would be unfair for the more successful elements of society to be expected to bolster them yet again .
james fownes , england james fownes .
i resent your charge that all people in poverty are layabouts who have not worked to better themselves .
bettering yourself is no guarantee of success today .
i am a recent university graduate in it , who spent over a year trying to find work .
395 -lrb- no exaggeration -rrb- applications later , i secured a job with a local authority on very poor wages considering my qualifications .
even now it is damn near impossible for me to save up enough money to afford a home of my own .
you thirty-something 's just think when you sit back in your luxurious , more or less already made lives .
would you want to be in the position of someone just starting out nowadays ?
i think not .
i expect lots of " the world does not owe you a living " comments from this post .
i will pre-empitvely reply by saying we do n't expect that .
we desire nothing more than a level playing field .
dan cochran , britain dan cochrain , your reply to james just serves to strengthen his point .
so you struggled to get a job ?
so did most of us " thirty somethings " , do you expect money to be thrown at you ?
so you ca n't afford a house ?
well neither could i until i had worked for over 8 years .
level playing field ?
there has never been a more level playing field , i fancy by " level " you actually mean nicely sloped in your favour so you have everything you could possibly want before you are 25 .
oh and by the by , who forced you to become an it specialist in the middle of an it downturn ?
bad judgement or just bad luck ?
it does n't matter , be patient , put some effort into developing yourself and you too can be a comfortably well off thirty something writing to talking point !
mark , uk education is how to prevent poverty .
if every kid in the country has a good education , then they will find it easier to get work and pull themselves out of poverty .
the other benefits of reduced crime and reduced welfare costs will mean more money to spare to improve education further .
education and the economy are linked in the long term .
stu , uk i am not an advocate of taxing the rich , but i believe that the 40 percent threshold should be raised to 45 or 50 percent .
the lower paid can not be expected to give more , without falling below the poverty line themselves .
and the middle classes must not be hammered again , so those that can afford it should pay a bit more .
i am sure that many would accept this providing the money was channelled to those in need , and not just lumped into the treasuries coffers .
baz , uk the redistribution of wealth is a great idea and should have been introduced a long time ago .
however , to raise the issue to the public is quite risky as the nation already does n't agree with his support for america , and the majority wo n't want their taxes raised .
especially since the nhs spending seems not to have made the slightest bit of difference .
angela , uk i think many people forget how well off they really are cc , scotland i certainly would n't mind paying extra tax for a better standard of living for all .
the common line of ' but i do n't trust the government with my money ' is a blatant excuse for those who are too mean and greedy to contribute a little more .
these are usually the same people who whinge about long nhs waiting lists sub-standard public facilities ! !
i think many people forget how well off they really are - they should be ashamed !
cc , scotland the problems with poverty are in part due to the disappearance of the traditional manual labour industries .
tax money should be spent to create new jobs for this sector .
heaven knows the road and rail infrastructure in this country could do with more people maintaining it .
euan gregory , scotland i ca n't believe the amount of poor excuses on this page to cover up people 's unwillingness to pay tax .
we do n't pay too much tax , in fact we pay a lot less than a lot of other countries .
if you want a decent country with good public services and welfare you have to pay for it , and that includes everyone .
i do think though that the super rich who avoid tax , illegally , should be locked up .
ambrose , uk i already pay far too much tax john , uk i work long hours in a high pressure job in the city .
i earn every penny that i am paid and i already pay far too much tax .
i grew up in a council house and my parents worked in a factory .
i have worked hard to get to my present position .
why should i pay more tax to subsidise those who have n't got the will power and self discipline to do the same ?
john , uk as a very low paid council worker our pension is the only thing that keeps us going .
at 31 i ca n't even afford to buy a house unlike some of those in this discussion .
so how am i supposed to fund the poor if i 'm already just above the poverty line myself ?
richard h , uk to put it simply - yes .
we all need to take some responsibility for those in out community who are less fortunate , for the most part through no fault of their own .
for some this may take the form of practical help within local communities , for others it might be to help a little more through taxes if they can afford it .
a penny on tax would not hurt anyone who is on average wage or above , provided the money was ring fenced only for handling poverty .
ian mcevoy , uk there is a huge body of evidence linking poverty and lack of opportunity with crime rich , uk it seems ironic on ' cracking crime day ' that so many of the comments seem to view poverty relief as being a purely altruistic affair .
there is a huge body of evidence linking poverty and lack of opportunity with crime , so any measures to alleviate the conditions of the poorest in society are of real benefit to us all .
tony blair should be applauded for his ideals even if the implementation is somewhat flawed .
rich , uk hell hath no fury like the middle classes being taxed .
steve perry , uk poverty is a scar on the uk left by 18 years of thatcherite tory government .
whilst the government has done a lot to reduce poverty in the uk over the past five years , through the introduction of measures like the working families tax credit and the minimum wage , the only way to really tackle the problem is to increase taxes - something that i would welcome .
malcolm powers , uk poverty then was poverty eddie o 'riordan , uk we pay enough direct and indirect taxation already - and what is poverty now ?
colour tv , video and running an old banger .
i came to this country from ireland in the 50 's and poverty then was poverty .
since then i have worked hard to get what i now own and i am not redistributing it to anybody .
eddie o 'riordan , uk the simple reason for poverty in the uk is that there are too many people out there who are out of work , who are being paid an unfair wage for a hard day 's work or are merely pensioners .
this is not related to taxation but to the gross misspending of the fiscal budgets by our elected and unelected officials , from councils to national government .
john , scotland , uk while it is tempting to think that tax can be made painless by merely taxing the rich , the trouble is that there are just not enough rich around .
high taxes simply cause them to leave the country .
the bulk of taxes have to be paid by the bulk of the population which means mr and mrs average .
patrick stevens , uk make it possible for people to get rich john sinton , usa it is always the suggestion that the way to help the poor is to tax the wealthy .
but the truth is that taxing money is a root cause of the problem .
make it possible for people to get rich is the answer , like in the usa .
if history has taught the us anything in the last 20 years , it has been to reduce government tinkering with the economy .
john sinton , usa by all means help but let 's tax those who can afford to pay .
years ago there used to be higher taxation for high earners .
let 's see that system reintroduced as a starting point .
david atkinson , england we will all be living in poverty if we have to pay much more tax .
dave , uk hopelessness is a very difficult cycle to break df , uk i come from a poor background but , luckily for me , my family culture was to work hard to better your position in life .
i am now what many might consider middle class -lrb- owning my own home is something my parents were never able to achieve -rrb- .
i realise that this ' redistribution of wealth ' is likely to hit my pocket , but if it guaranteed that children from a less ambitious background might be able to believe they can make something of themselves , then i am prepared to pay .
hopelessness is a very difficult cycle to break .
df , uk the redistribution of wealth through taxation currently benefits the rich .
billionaires like rupert murdoch avoid tax in this country , effectively being subsidised by the rest of us .
huge subsidies go to arms manufacturers and dealers .
we all pay plenty of tax .
just look at how it is spent and you find where the real problems of distribution lie ...
duncan drury , london , uk perhaps mr blair can take the money he was going to spend on invading iraq and instead spend it on something useful in the uk .
james , uk governments prefer quick fix solutions matt , uk money spent on tackling root causes of problems does n't yield quick results .
it may be years or even decades before the benefits filter through to society in general by which time someone else is likely to be in power .
governments prefer quick fix solutions to paper over the problems rather than address the real issues .
common sense tells us that prevention is better than cure but our government staggers on apparently oblivious to this .
matt , uk i was in a supermarket yesterday , stuck in a queue behind a young woman of about 20 .
she was chatting away to her friend while trying -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- to control a toddler and a baby .
part of her conversation was about the dss refusing to pay for new shoes for the toddler .
her shopping basket included piles of frozen ready-meals , sweets and crisps - hardly the cheapest option .
but the worst of it was that she also had a pack of 200 cigarettes in her basket !
while i do n't really care who smokes or not , i find it astounding that she believes the state should care for her children while she spends her welfare money on fast food and cigarettes .
alan , uk sorry , i do n't see the relationship between more tax to the government and less poverty .
ban advertising which persuades people to buy things they do not need and can not afford .
clive , uk it might be a good idea to review how our existing taxes are currently spent hugh , uk do you mean more taxes on top of those i already pay to fund mps ' pay rises and final salary index-linked pensions ?
perhaps it might be a good idea to review how our existing taxes are currently spent , without squeezing the poor taxpayer for ever-increasing amounts .
hugh , uk i already pay nearly £ 1,000 a month in tax .
is that not enough ?
the government should target people rich enough to hire accountants to hide money offshore .
oliver richardson , uk start taxing the super-rich fatcats before you pick on the people that do the real work in this county thanks .
how about a 50 % tax band for incomes over 100k ?
that would be a start .
rob , uk very little of the billions gained from taxes on drivers ever get put back into the system .
why should we believe that an extra penny on the pound will be spent on poverty ?
chris , uk it is not a long term solution jm , uk the question assumes that by paying more tax we can ease the problem of poverty .
i have my doubts about this .
certainly it may alleviate some of the symptoms of poverty in the short run .
however it is not a long term solution .
i have worked as a mentor to a young man from a very poor family and i can tell you that his predicament was caused and is perpetuated by poor decisions made by his single parent mother .
if the money is to be spent on anything it should be pumped into education , including sex education , so that young people do not have 6 children by 3 different -lrb- and absent -rrb- fathers .
jm , uk i do n't mind paying extra for essential services .
however many welfare programmes actually keep people in poverty .
also i do not trust our government to redistribute my money fairly .
surely the best way would be to lower income tax for low paid workers .
philip shorter , england like a lot of people in this country i would agree with this in principle ; the problem is that i can not trust this or any government to target that money effectively and efficiently .
and as phil t alluded to , do we really want to spend £ 4.5 billion on a war to keep the rest of the world " safe " ?
andy , scotland there is no need to increase taxes to help reduce poverty in the uk .
all we have to do is stop trying to play policemen of the world , invest the money spent on corrupt foreign governments back into our society , stop paying so much to euro mps , cut out all of the european bureaucracy , stop supporting white elephants like the dome and give politicians a huge pay cut .

the prime minister , tony blair has reasserted the labour party 's traditional belief in the redistribution of wealth , power and opportunity .
in a speech at a north london school on wednesday to mark the publication of the government 's annual child poverty report , mr blair also countered growing criticism of his government 's commitment to tackling poverty .
the report estimates 1.4 million youngsters have been rescued from low incomes since 1997 and reveals teenage pregnancies have fallen by 6 % .
previously , labour ministers have often steered clear of talking about redistribution because of fears it means higher taxes .
do you feel that goverment policies have helped to reduce poverty over the past five years ?
would you be prepared to pay increased taxes to improve conditions for britain 's poor ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
i would much prefer to stick to voluntary contributions linda , uk i have always been actively involved in the charity world and have devoted much of my own resources and time to helping improve the lives of those in need .
however , i would not like to pay extra tax to help poverty alleviation as i think that the present government would be too incompetent to spend it .
in the aid world , we have ways of measuring what percentage of the donor 's contribution reaches the target after overheads and administration .
i imagine that if the government were to perform such a test , the results would be frightening .
i would much prefer to stick to voluntary contributions .
linda , uk we 've always known that labour governments want to redistribute wealth - no surprise there .
but what worries me is the suggestion that " opportunity " will also be redistributed now .
whose opportunities to do what will be taken away , and given to whom ?
are able students going to be refused university places to give them to the less able ?
is n't this the logical extension of our progressive tax system ?
jan dawson , uk altruism is way down the list of priorities in human nature simon d , england nothing will change .
it 's not really the government 's fault though .
it 's all down to human nature .
being a success is part of our psyche .
the selfish gene will always win out .
altruism is way down the list of priorities in human nature .
we are designed for survival this way .
simon d , england no , i do n't want to pay more tax .
as a middle income , single gay man i pay and subsidize too many people already .
i live in s east where i ca n't afford to buy a flat so i simply do not want to give more .
there are plenty of other sources where money can be collected by making this government spend less frivolously .
there are very few poor in england anyway .
even the beggar on the street here is rich compared to a person living in asian or south american shantytowns .
i novakovic , uk tax the rich not those in the middle ian grimley , uk any redistribution only ever seems to be from the middle classes to the poor .
the wealthy always escape , perhaps because those in power are either wealthy themselves or because of the influence the wealthy bring to bear .
tax the rich not those in the middle .
ian grimley , uk labour and tax are like strawberry and cream .
they go well together .
any excuses to raise taxes .
al , uk so i am meant to spend my whole working life bailing out the poor just so when i retire i can get a state pension that will hardly cover the cost of a pint of milk a week !
julia , uk we can talk about many issues concerning the proposed tax increases but my own feeling is that it would be pointless .
this country is so frustrating to live in that i am going to emigrate at the first opportunity .
i have absolutely no confidence in the future and have already told my children -lrb- both university educated -rrb- to also leave .
mr blair and his cohorts can go shove it !
k. white , england we need an overhaul of the benefit systems f. davies , uk where is all the tax going now ?
we need an overhaul of the benefit systems so that benefits are a stop gap and not a right or privilege that most people think they are entitled to on a permanent basis .
get more people into work , pay a decent level of wages and guess what - more income for the government without raising taxation level .
f. davies , uk what about corporate tax ?
multinational corporations make billions in profit , and yet still get huge tax breaks at our expense .
but our ' fearless ' politicians are afraid of upsetting their big business pals to do anything about it .
ben drake , york , uk to all those who say they would n't begrudge paying extra tax , i ask : what are you waiting for ?
there 's nothing stopping you from writing out a cheque to the inland revenue .
henry case , uk i 'm amazed at all these people who feel they need to pay more tax .
it 's so simple : they can just write a cheque to " hm treasury " for however much they feel they 've short-changed gordon brown .
no need to annoy the rest of us with all this political whining .
mike holmes , scotland the only way to reduce poverty is to increase benefit levels to the level where people can have a dignified existence neil rogall , uk the only way to reduce poverty is to increase benefit levels to the level where people can have a dignified existence .
the money that blair spends on armaments and war could be used to bring millions out of poverty and despair .
in addition we need to go back to a situation where the rich -lrb- not the middle classes -rrb- are taxed heavily - those who have gained their wealth by profiting from others labour both here and abroad are forced to contribute to the society that has made them rich .
if only tony blair would do that - instead he offers nothing but privatisation , neo-liberalism , and authoritarianism .
and of course war .
neil rogall , uk neil rogall , uk : dignity does not come from money , it comes from working for a living .
as others have said the key is education , a good education will get you a good job and good wages .
high beneit levels just means your first job pays for the baby sitter and you are no better off at the end of the day .
michael pearce , uk to neil rogall , what a genius idea that is , then all of us can give up work and live on the generous handouts you propose .
none of us needs to ever work again ! !
on second thought , maybe there is a slight flaw in this plan ?
bankrupting the uk , but i suppose as you obviously live in cloud cuckoo land that wont be a problem for you .
tim , uk when the various " stealth " taxes are taken into account -lrb- vat , national insurance - which is a tax by another name , tax on insurance , airport taxes , fuel taxes , alcohol taxes , capital gains tax , inheritance tax , stamp duty etc -rrb- are taken into account , we already pay around 65 % tax .
let the government look to its own inefficiencies and profligate waste before it tries to take still more from a population which is already one of the most heavily taxed in europe .
kate , england the 40 % tax rate should not be raised as it stands .
people on little over 30k a year , just a few thousand more than the average wage , already have to pay almost half their salary in taxes and should not penalised any further .
if anything tax rates for them should be lowered , as the jump from 22 % to 40 % is too high and a more progressive tax code introduced topping off at say 50 % for those earning over 75k .
meanwhile " sin taxes " on fatty and unhealthy food should be introduced to help curb the appalling rates of poverty amongst the poor .
it will take time to have an effect but will pay dividends in the long run .
lr , england compared to most of the other big economic countries we pay some of the lowest rates of tax .
fact !
so where will all our big earning bosses go and work if the uk raised taxes ?
germany where the highest rate of income tax is 51 % ?
france where the highest rate of income tax is 54 % ?
i guess they could go to italy where the highest rate is only 46 % !
in the netherlands the highest rate is 60 % .
plus most of these countries also pay higher rates of vat !
i wonder if all their government services are better than ours ?
food for thought !
steve , england we have to be prepared to pay our fair share of tax to improve services and quality of life of the vulnerable .
this means taxing the rich a little more and addressing their tax avoidance .
civilisation is expensive .
the vulgar personification of the inland revenue as " the taxman getting his hands on your cash " perpetuates our miserly , short-sighted attitudes .
tom phelan , uk how about some serious accountability before taking more of my hard earned cash antony , london , uk i am pretty sick of managing government wastage and inefficiency with the " quick fix " solution of yet another tax hike .

if every kid in the country has a good education , then they will find it easier to get work and pull themselves out of poverty .
the other benefits of reduced crime and reduced welfare costs will mean more money to spare to improve education further .
education and the economy are linked in the long term .
stu , uk i am not an advocate of taxing the rich , but i believe that the 40 percent threshold should be raised to 45 or 50 percent .
the lower paid can not be expected to give more , without falling below the poverty line themselves .
and the middle classes must not be hammered again , so those that can afford it should pay a bit more .
i am sure that many would accept this providing the money was channelled to those in need , and not just lumped into the treasuries coffers .
baz , uk the redistribution of wealth is a great idea and should have been introduced a long time ago .
however , to raise the issue to the public is quite risky as the nation already does n't agree with his support for america , and the majority wo n't want their taxes raised .
especially since the nhs spending seems not to have made the slightest bit of difference .
angela , uk i think many people forget how well off they really are cc , scotland i certainly would n't mind paying extra tax for a better standard of living for all .
the common line of ' but i do n't trust the government with my money ' is a blatant excuse for those who are too mean and greedy to contribute a little more .
these are usually the same people who whinge about long nhs waiting lists sub-standard public facilities ! !
i think many people forget how well off they really are - they should be ashamed !
cc , scotland the problems with poverty are in part due to the disappearance of the traditional manual labour industries .
tax money should be spent to create new jobs for this sector .
heaven knows the road and rail infrastructure in this country could do with more people maintaining it .
euan gregory , scotland i ca n't believe the amount of poor excuses on this page to cover up people 's unwillingness to pay tax .
we do n't pay too much tax , in fact we pay a lot less than a lot of other countries .
if you want a decent country with good public services and welfare you have to pay for it , and that includes everyone .
i do think though that the super rich who avoid tax , illegally , should be locked up .
ambrose , uk i already pay far too much tax john , uk i work long hours in a high pressure job in the city .
i earn every penny that i am paid and i already pay far too much tax .
i grew up in a council house and my parents worked in a factory .
i have worked hard to get to my present position .
why should i pay more tax to subsidise those who have n't got the will power and self discipline to do the same ?
john , uk as a very low paid council worker our pension is the only thing that keeps us going .
at 31 i ca n't even afford to buy a house unlike some of those in this discussion .
so how am i supposed to fund the poor if i 'm already just above the poverty line myself ?
richard h , uk to put it simply - yes .
we all need to take some responsibility for those in out community who are less fortunate , for the most part through no fault of their own .
for some this may take the form of practical help within local communities , for others it might be to help a little more through taxes if they can afford it .
a penny on tax would not hurt anyone who is on average wage or above , provided the money was ring fenced only for handling poverty .
ian mcevoy , uk there is a huge body of evidence linking poverty and lack of opportunity with crime rich , uk it seems ironic on ' cracking crime day ' that so many of the comments seem to view poverty relief as being a purely altruistic affair .
there is a huge body of evidence linking poverty and lack of opportunity with crime , so any measures to alleviate the conditions of the poorest in society are of real benefit to us all .
tony blair should be applauded for his ideals even if the implementation is somewhat flawed .
rich , uk hell hath no fury like the middle classes being taxed .
steve perry , uk poverty is a scar on the uk left by 18 years of thatcherite tory government .
whilst the government has done a lot to reduce poverty in the uk over the past five years , through the introduction of measures like the working families tax credit and the minimum wage , the only way to really tackle the problem is to increase taxes - something that i would welcome .
malcolm powers , uk poverty then was poverty eddie o 'riordan , uk we pay enough direct and indirect taxation already - and what is poverty now ?
colour tv , video and running an old banger .
i came to this country from ireland in the 50 's and poverty then was poverty .
since then i have worked hard to get what i now own and i am not redistributing it to anybody .
eddie o 'riordan , uk the simple reason for poverty in the uk is that there are too many people out there who are out of work , who are being paid an unfair wage for a hard day 's work or are merely pensioners .
this is not related to taxation but to the gross misspending of the fiscal budgets by our elected and unelected officials , from councils to national government .
john , scotland , uk while it is tempting to think that tax can be made painless by merely taxing the rich , the trouble is that there are just not enough rich around .
high taxes simply cause them to leave the country .
the bulk of taxes have to be paid by the bulk of the population which means mr and mrs average .
patrick stevens , uk make it possible for people to get rich john sinton , usa it is always the suggestion that the way to help the poor is to tax the wealthy .
but the truth is that taxing money is a root cause of the problem .
make it possible for people to get rich is the answer , like in the usa .
if history has taught the us anything in the last 20 years , it has been to reduce government tinkering with the economy .
john sinton , usa by all means help but let 's tax those who can afford to pay .
years ago there used to be higher taxation for high earners .
let 's see that system reintroduced as a starting point .
david atkinson , england we will all be living in poverty if we have to pay much more tax .
dave , uk hopelessness is a very difficult cycle to break df , uk i come from a poor background but , luckily for me , my family culture was to work hard to better your position in life .
i am now what many might consider middle class -lrb- owning my own home is something my parents were never able to achieve -rrb- .
i realise that this ' redistribution of wealth ' is likely to hit my pocket , but if it guaranteed that children from a less ambitious background might be able to believe they can make something of themselves , then i am prepared to pay .
hopelessness is a very difficult cycle to break .
df , uk the redistribution of wealth through taxation currently benefits the rich .
billionaires like rupert murdoch avoid tax in this country , effectively being subsidised by the rest of us .
huge subsidies go to arms manufacturers and dealers .
we all pay plenty of tax .
just look at how it is spent and you find where the real problems of distribution lie ...
duncan drury , london , uk perhaps mr blair can take the money he was going to spend on invading iraq and instead spend it on something useful in the uk .
james , uk governments prefer quick fix solutions matt , uk money spent on tackling root causes of problems does n't yield quick results .
it may be years or even decades before the benefits filter through to society in general by which time someone else is likely to be in power .
governments prefer quick fix solutions to paper over the problems rather than address the real issues .
common sense tells us that prevention is better than cure but our government staggers on apparently oblivious to this .
matt , uk i was in a supermarket yesterday , stuck in a queue behind a young woman of about 20 .
she was chatting away to her friend while trying -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- to control a toddler and a baby .
part of her conversation was about the dss refusing to pay for new shoes for the toddler .
her shopping basket included piles of frozen ready-meals , sweets and crisps - hardly the cheapest option .
but the worst of it was that she also had a pack of 200 cigarettes in her basket !
while i do n't really care who smokes or not , i find it astounding that she believes the state should care for her children while she spends her welfare money on fast food and cigarettes .
alan , uk sorry , i do n't see the relationship between more tax to the government and less poverty .
ban advertising which persuades people to buy things they do not need and can not afford .
clive , uk it might be a good idea to review how our existing taxes are currently spent hugh , uk do you mean more taxes on top of those i already pay to fund mps ' pay rises and final salary index-linked pensions ?
perhaps it might be a good idea to review how our existing taxes are currently spent , without squeezing the poor taxpayer for ever-increasing amounts .
hugh , uk i already pay nearly £ 1,000 a month in tax .
is that not enough ?
the government should target people rich enough to hire accountants to hide money offshore .
oliver richardson , uk start taxing the super-rich fatcats before you pick on the people that do the real work in this county thanks .
how about a 50 % tax band for incomes over 100k ?
that would be a start .
rob , uk very little of the billions gained from taxes on drivers ever get put back into the system .
why should we believe that an extra penny on the pound will be spent on poverty ?
chris , uk it is not a long term solution jm , uk the question assumes that by paying more tax we can ease the problem of poverty .
i have my doubts about this .
certainly it may alleviate some of the symptoms of poverty in the short run .
however it is not a long term solution .
i have worked as a mentor to a young man from a very poor family and i can tell you that his predicament was caused and is perpetuated by poor decisions made by his single parent mother .
if the money is to be spent on anything it should be pumped into education , including sex education , so that young people do not have 6 children by 3 different -lrb- and absent -rrb- fathers .
jm , uk i do n't mind paying extra for essential services .
however many welfare programmes actually keep people in poverty .
also i do not trust our government to redistribute my money fairly .
surely the best way would be to lower income tax for low paid workers .
philip shorter , england like a lot of people in this country i would agree with this in principle ; the problem is that i can not trust this or any government to target that money effectively and efficiently .
and as phil t alluded to , do we really want to spend £ 4.5 billion on a war to keep the rest of the world " safe " ?
andy , scotland there is no need to increase taxes to help reduce poverty in the uk .
all we have to do is stop trying to play policemen of the world , invest the money spent on corrupt foreign governments back into our society , stop paying so much to euro mps , cut out all of the european bureaucracy , stop supporting white elephants like the dome and give politicians a huge pay cut .

the prime minister , tony blair has reasserted the labour party 's traditional belief in the redistribution of wealth , power and opportunity .
in a speech at a north london school on wednesday to mark the publication of the government 's annual child poverty report , mr blair also countered growing criticism of his government 's commitment to tackling poverty .
the report estimates 1.4 million youngsters have been rescued from low incomes since 1997 and reveals teenage pregnancies have fallen by 6 % .
previously , labour ministers have often steered clear of talking about redistribution because of fears it means higher taxes .
do you feel that goverment policies have helped to reduce poverty over the past five years ?
would you be prepared to pay increased taxes to improve conditions for britain 's poor ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
i would much prefer to stick to voluntary contributions linda , uk i have always been actively involved in the charity world and have devoted much of my own resources and time to helping improve the lives of those in need .
however , i would not like to pay extra tax to help poverty alleviation as i think that the present government would be too incompetent to spend it .
in the aid world , we have ways of measuring what percentage of the donor 's contribution reaches the target after overheads and administration .
i imagine that if the government were to perform such a test , the results would be frightening .
i would much prefer to stick to voluntary contributions .
linda , uk we 've always known that labour governments want to redistribute wealth - no surprise there .
but what worries me is the suggestion that " opportunity " will also be redistributed now .
whose opportunities to do what will be taken away , and given to whom ?
are able students going to be refused university places to give them to the less able ?
is n't this the logical extension of our progressive tax system ?
jan dawson , uk altruism is way down the list of priorities in human nature simon d , england nothing will change .
it 's not really the government 's fault though .
it 's all down to human nature .
being a success is part of our psyche .
the selfish gene will always win out .
altruism is way down the list of priorities in human nature .
we are designed for survival this way .
simon d , england no , i do n't want to pay more tax .
as a middle income , single gay man i pay and subsidize too many people already .
i live in s east where i ca n't afford to buy a flat so i simply do not want to give more .
there are plenty of other sources where money can be collected by making this government spend less frivolously .
there are very few poor in england anyway .
even the beggar on the street here is rich compared to a person living in asian or south american shantytowns .
i novakovic , uk tax the rich not those in the middle ian grimley , uk any redistribution only ever seems to be from the middle classes to the poor .
the wealthy always escape , perhaps because those in power are either wealthy themselves or because of the influence the wealthy bring to bear .
tax the rich not those in the middle .
ian grimley , uk labour and tax are like strawberry and cream .
they go well together .
any excuses to raise taxes .
al , uk so i am meant to spend my whole working life bailing out the poor just so when i retire i can get a state pension that will hardly cover the cost of a pint of milk a week !
julia , uk we can talk about many issues concerning the proposed tax increases but my own feeling is that it would be pointless .
this country is so frustrating to live in that i am going to emigrate at the first opportunity .
i have absolutely no confidence in the future and have already told my children -lrb- both university educated -rrb- to also leave .
mr blair and his cohorts can go shove it !
k. white , england we need an overhaul of the benefit systems f. davies , uk where is all the tax going now ?
we need an overhaul of the benefit systems so that benefits are a stop gap and not a right or privilege that most people think they are entitled to on a permanent basis .
get more people into work , pay a decent level of wages and guess what - more income for the government without raising taxation level .
f. davies , uk what about corporate tax ?
multinational corporations make billions in profit , and yet still get huge tax breaks at our expense .
but our ' fearless ' politicians are afraid of upsetting their big business pals to do anything about it .
ben drake , york , uk to all those who say they would n't begrudge paying extra tax , i ask : what are you waiting for ?
there 's nothing stopping you from writing out a cheque to the inland revenue .
henry case , uk i 'm amazed at all these people who feel they need to pay more tax .
it 's so simple : they can just write a cheque to " hm treasury " for however much they feel they 've short-changed gordon brown .
no need to annoy the rest of us with all this political whining .
mike holmes , scotland the only way to reduce poverty is to increase benefit levels to the level where people can have a dignified existence neil rogall , uk the only way to reduce poverty is to increase benefit levels to the level where people can have a dignified existence .
the money that blair spends on armaments and war could be used to bring millions out of poverty and despair .
in addition we need to go back to a situation where the rich -lrb- not the middle classes -rrb- are taxed heavily - those who have gained their wealth by profiting from others labour both here and abroad are forced to contribute to the society that has made them rich .
if only tony blair would do that - instead he offers nothing but privatisation , neo-liberalism , and authoritarianism .
and of course war .
neil rogall , uk neil rogall , uk : dignity does not come from money , it comes from working for a living .
as others have said the key is education , a good education will get you a good job and good wages .
high beneit levels just means your first job pays for the baby sitter and you are no better off at the end of the day .
michael pearce , uk to neil rogall , what a genius idea that is , then all of us can give up work and live on the generous handouts you propose .
none of us needs to ever work again ! !
on second thought , maybe there is a slight flaw in this plan ?
bankrupting the uk , but i suppose as you obviously live in cloud cuckoo land that wont be a problem for you .
tim , uk when the various " stealth " taxes are taken into account -lrb- vat , national insurance - which is a tax by another name , tax on insurance , airport taxes , fuel taxes , alcohol taxes , capital gains tax , inheritance tax , stamp duty etc -rrb- are taken into account , we already pay around 65 % tax .
let the government look to its own inefficiencies and profligate waste before it tries to take still more from a population which is already one of the most heavily taxed in europe .
kate , england the 40 % tax rate should not be raised as it stands .
people on little over 30k a year , just a few thousand more than the average wage , already have to pay almost half their salary in taxes and should not penalised any further .
if anything tax rates for them should be lowered , as the jump from 22 % to 40 % is too high and a more progressive tax code introduced topping off at say 50 % for those earning over 75k .
meanwhile " sin taxes " on fatty and unhealthy food should be introduced to help curb the appalling rates of poverty amongst the poor .
it will take time to have an effect but will pay dividends in the long run .
lr , england compared to most of the other big economic countries we pay some of the lowest rates of tax .
fact !
so where will all our big earning bosses go and work if the uk raised taxes ?
germany where the highest rate of income tax is 51 % ?
france where the highest rate of income tax is 54 % ?
i guess they could go to italy where the highest rate is only 46 % !
in the netherlands the highest rate is 60 % .
plus most of these countries also pay higher rates of vat !
i wonder if all their government services are better than ours ?
food for thought !
steve , england we have to be prepared to pay our fair share of tax to improve services and quality of life of the vulnerable .
this means taxing the rich a little more and addressing their tax avoidance .
civilisation is expensive .
the vulgar personification of the inland revenue as " the taxman getting his hands on your cash " perpetuates our miserly , short-sighted attitudes .
tom phelan , uk how about some serious accountability before taking more of my hard earned cash antony , london , uk i am pretty sick of managing government wastage and inefficiency with the " quick fix " solution of yet another tax hike .
with 10 % ni contributions , 17.5 % vat , stamp duty , petrol tax , death duty , etc. plus one third of my salary gone from source .
where does it all go ?
how about some serious accountability before taking more of my hard earned cash .
they may as well incinerate half the money i currently pay over for all the good it does .
i would never agree to higher taxes until those in power prove they are using it responsibly .
antony , london , uk one aspect of poverty in the south east is that salaries no longer buy homes , and whilst this poverty trap continues we will see an increasing number of public service strikes , fire service and tube strikes could just be the beginning .
increasing interest rates and preventing people buying numerous buy-to-let properties would help to ease the problem .
tim , uk the problem is n't so much as the more well off paying tax , but making many employers pay living wage salaries .
there are too many companies out there expecting to pay £ 12,000 or less for what are quite demanding jobs .
i 'm sure such employers will bleat that they ca n't afford it , but why should the taxpayer subsidise them ?
phil cattermole , united kingdom my husband and i work over 80 hours a week between us , we do not have a car , we have given up smoking and we made a conscious decision not to have children which we felt we could not afford .
we do have a mortgage but we are considered well off because we are buying our own house .
we are fed up of continually having to bale out the " poor " - most of whom spend a lot of money on cigarettes , take away food and cars .
why does n't the government not take away child benefit from the well off people and redistribute it to the less well off people with children .
this benefit is the only benefit which is not means tested and it is given to rich and poor people alike .
marlene wodo , england i would not trust the government to distribute the money generated from higher taxation to the poor , it would simply be used to pay for their next election campaign .
so no way we pay far too much as it is for very little return , britain is still a rip off !
doug , london , uk the idea that slapping taxes on the rich will solve all the uk 's problems belongs in a student union , not in the real world !
peter , uk so apart from the 40 % i pay on my salary , the % 80 i pay on petrol , the 18 % vat , road tax , the tax on cigarettes and alcohol , how much more of my hard earned does this government want ?
and i really want to know what they spend it all on ?
rail companies are privatised , greatly reduced support for students , miniscule police force , more and more people in private healthcare ?
duncan , uk there is no need to increase the level of tax if you increase tax receipts by creating more wealth .
investing in britain , through infrastructure improvements and helping businesses .
help the poor by providing the opportunities for them to earn a good wage .
spencer dutton , brit in germany re-introduction of the highest rate tax bands for very high earners would be a good starting point steve , uk i think tax rises are a particularly grey area that most people agree are a good idea , if the money goes to the right places , and that the right people are taxed - as long as it 's not me paying .
re-introduction of the highest rate tax bands for very high earners would be a good starting point .
steve , uk does anybody realise that in the past 5 years since new labour came to power that the total tax pot has risen from £ 286 billion to nearer £ 500 billion per year .
we should all be asking where on earth all that money is going .
and then they have the cheek to demand more of our money .
gavin , uk more taxes ?
do we not pay enough already ?
i 'm a single hard working man , and i struggle every month .
i would n't expect anyone to help me out .
louis kabbani , uk the idea of paying more tax to support poor people is abhorrent james fownes , england the idea of paying more tax to support poor people is abhorrent , many of them are in the situation due to laziness and it would be unfair for the more successful elements of society to be expected to bolster them yet again .
james fownes , england james fownes .
i resent your charge that all people in poverty are layabouts who have not worked to better themselves .
bettering yourself is no guarantee of success today .
i am a recent university graduate in it , who spent over a year trying to find work .
395 -lrb- no exaggeration -rrb- applications later , i secured a job with a local authority on very poor wages considering my qualifications .
even now it is damn near impossible for me to save up enough money to afford a home of my own .
you thirty-something 's just think when you sit back in your luxurious , more or less already made lives .
would you want to be in the position of someone just starting out nowadays ?
i think not .
i expect lots of " the world does not owe you a living " comments from this post .
i will pre-empitvely reply by saying we do n't expect that .
we desire nothing more than a level playing field .
dan cochran , britain dan cochrain , your reply to james just serves to strengthen his point .
so you struggled to get a job ?
so did most of us " thirty somethings " , do you expect money to be thrown at you ?
so you ca n't afford a house ?
well neither could i until i had worked for over 8 years .
level playing field ?
there has never been a more level playing field , i fancy by " level " you actually mean nicely sloped in your favour so you have everything you could possibly want before you are 25 .
oh and by the by , who forced you to become an it specialist in the middle of an it downturn ?
bad judgement or just bad luck ?
it does n't matter , be patient , put some effort into developing yourself and you too can be a comfortably well off thirty something writing to talking point !

james , uk governments prefer quick fix solutions matt , uk money spent on tackling root causes of problems does n't yield quick results .
it may be years or even decades before the benefits filter through to society in general by which time someone else is likely to be in power .
governments prefer quick fix solutions to paper over the problems rather than address the real issues .
common sense tells us that prevention is better than cure but our government staggers on apparently oblivious to this .
matt , uk i was in a supermarket yesterday , stuck in a queue behind a young woman of about 20 .
she was chatting away to her friend while trying -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- to control a toddler and a baby .
part of her conversation was about the dss refusing to pay for new shoes for the toddler .
her shopping basket included piles of frozen ready-meals , sweets and crisps - hardly the cheapest option .
but the worst of it was that she also had a pack of 200 cigarettes in her basket !
while i do n't really care who smokes or not , i find it astounding that she believes the state should care for her children while she spends her welfare money on fast food and cigarettes .
alan , uk sorry , i do n't see the relationship between more tax to the government and less poverty .
ban advertising which persuades people to buy things they do not need and can not afford .
clive , uk it might be a good idea to review how our existing taxes are currently spent hugh , uk do you mean more taxes on top of those i already pay to fund mps ' pay rises and final salary index-linked pensions ?
perhaps it might be a good idea to review how our existing taxes are currently spent , without squeezing the poor taxpayer for ever-increasing amounts .
hugh , uk i already pay nearly £ 1,000 a month in tax .
is that not enough ?
the government should target people rich enough to hire accountants to hide money offshore .
oliver richardson , uk start taxing the super-rich fatcats before you pick on the people that do the real work in this county thanks .
how about a 50 % tax band for incomes over 100k ?
that would be a start .
rob , uk very little of the billions gained from taxes on drivers ever get put back into the system .
why should we believe that an extra penny on the pound will be spent on poverty ?
chris , uk it is not a long term solution jm , uk the question assumes that by paying more tax we can ease the problem of poverty .
i have my doubts about this .
certainly it may alleviate some of the symptoms of poverty in the short run .
however it is not a long term solution .
i have worked as a mentor to a young man from a very poor family and i can tell you that his predicament was caused and is perpetuated by poor decisions made by his single parent mother .
if the money is to be spent on anything it should be pumped into education , including sex education , so that young people do not have 6 children by 3 different -lrb- and absent -rrb- fathers .
jm , uk i do n't mind paying extra for essential services .
however many welfare programmes actually keep people in poverty .
also i do not trust our government to redistribute my money fairly .
surely the best way would be to lower income tax for low paid workers .
philip shorter , england like a lot of people in this country i would agree with this in principle ; the problem is that i can not trust this or any government to target that money effectively and efficiently .
and as phil t alluded to , do we really want to spend £ 4.5 billion on a war to keep the rest of the world " safe " ?
andy , scotland there is no need to increase taxes to help reduce poverty in the uk .
all we have to do is stop trying to play policemen of the world , invest the money spent on corrupt foreign governments back into our society , stop paying so much to euro mps , cut out all of the european bureaucracy , stop supporting white elephants like the dome and give politicians a huge pay cut .
phil t , cornishman in oman vote results would you pay higher taxes to ease poverty ?
yes 26.35 % no 73.65 % 1351 votes cast results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion see also : 18 sep 02 -pipe- politics blair renews redistribution goal 11 apr 02 -pipe- uk ' i ca n't afford what i need ' internet links : child poverty action group the labour party social market foundation the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top talking point stories now : can tony blair win the argument on iraq ?

bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point talking point contents : forum monday , 23 september , 2002 , 08:18 gmt 09:18 uk would you pay more tax to ease poverty ?
the prime minister , tony blair has reasserted the labour party 's traditional belief in the redistribution of wealth , power and opportunity .
in a speech at a north london school on wednesday to mark the publication of the government 's annual child poverty report , mr blair also countered growing criticism of his government 's commitment to tackling poverty .
the report estimates 1.4 million youngsters have been rescued from low incomes since 1997 and reveals teenage pregnancies have fallen by 6 % .
previously , labour ministers have often steered clear of talking about redistribution because of fears it means higher taxes .
do you feel that goverment policies have helped to reduce poverty over the past five years ?
would you be prepared to pay increased taxes to improve conditions for britain 's poor ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below . "
i would much prefer to stick to voluntary contributions " linda , uk i have always been actively involved in the charity world and have devoted much of my own resources and time to helping improve the lives of those in need .
however , i would not like to pay extra tax to help poverty alleviation as i think that the present government would be too incompetent to spend it .
in the aid world , we have ways of measuring what percentage of the donor 's contribution reaches the target after overheads and administration .
i imagine that if the government were to perform such a test , the results would be frightening .
i would much prefer to stick to voluntary contributions .
linda , uk we 've always known that labour governments want to redistribute wealth - no surprise there .
but what worries me is the suggestion that " opportunity " will also be redistributed now .
whose opportunities to do what will be taken away , and given to whom ?
are able students going to be refused university places to give them to the less able ?
is n't this the logical extension of our progressive tax system ?
jan dawson , uk " altruism is way down the list of priorities in human nature " simon d , england nothing will change .
it 's not really the government 's fault though .
it 's all down to human nature .
being a success is part of our psyche .
the selfish gene will always win out .
altruism is way down the list of priorities in human nature .
we are designed for survival this way .
simon d , england no , i do n't want to pay more tax .
as a middle income , single gay man i pay and subsidize too many people already .
i live in s east where i ca n't afford to buy a flat so i simply do not want to give more .
there are plenty of other sources where money can be collected by making this government spend less frivolously .
there are very few poor in england anyway .
even the beggar on the street here is rich compared to a person living in asian or south american shantytowns .
i novakovic , uk " tax the rich not those in the middle " ian grimley , uk any redistribution only ever seems to be from the middle classes to the poor .
the wealthy always escape , perhaps because those in power are either wealthy themselves or because of the influence the wealthy bring to bear .
tax the rich not those in the middle .
ian grimley , uk labour and tax are like strawberry and cream .
they go well together .
any excuses to raise taxes .
al , uk so i am meant to spend my whole working life bailing out the poor just so when i retire i can get a state pension that will hardly cover the cost of a pint of milk a week !
julia , uk we can talk about many issues concerning the proposed tax increases but my own feeling is that it would be pointless .
this country is so frustrating to live in that i am going to emigrate at the first opportunity .
i have absolutely no confidence in the future and have already told my children -lrb- both university educated -rrb- to also leave .
mr blair and his cohorts can go shove it !
k. white , england " we need an overhaul of the benefit systems " f. davies , uk where is all the tax going now ?
we need an overhaul of the benefit systems so that benefits are a stop gap and not a right or privilege that most people think they are entitled to on a permanent basis .
get more people into work , pay a decent level of wages and guess what - more income for the government without raising taxation level .
f. davies , uk what about corporate tax ?
multinational corporations make billions in profit , and yet still get huge tax breaks at our expense .
but our ' fearless ' politicians are afraid of upsetting their big business pals to do anything about it .
ben drake , york , uk to all those who say they would n't begrudge paying extra tax , i ask : what are you waiting for ?
there 's nothing stopping you from writing out a cheque to the inland revenue .
henry case , uk i 'm amazed at all these people who feel they need to pay more tax .
it 's so simple : they can just write a cheque to " hm treasury " for however much they feel they 've short-changed gordon brown .
no need to annoy the rest of us with all this political whining .
mike holmes , scotland " the only way to reduce poverty is to increase benefit levels to the level where people can have a dignified existence " neil rogall , uk the only way to reduce poverty is to increase benefit levels to the level where people can have a dignified existence .
the money that blair spends on armaments and war could be used to bring millions out of poverty and despair .
in addition we need to go back to a situation where the rich -lrb- not the middle classes -rrb- are taxed heavily - those who have gained their wealth by profiting from others labour both here and abroad are forced to contribute to the society that has made them rich .
if only tony blair would do that - instead he offers nothing but privatisation , neo-liberalism , and authoritarianism .
and of course war .
neil rogall , uk neil rogall , uk : dignity does not come from money , it comes from working for a living .
as others have said the key is education , a good education will get you a good job and good wages .
high beneit levels just means your first job pays for the baby sitter and you are no better off at the end of the day .
michael pearce , uk to neil rogall , what a genius idea that is , then all of us can give up work and live on the generous handouts you propose .
none of us needs to ever work again ! !
on second thought , maybe there is a slight flaw in this plan ?
bankrupting the uk , but i suppose as you obviously live in cloud cuckoo land that wont be a problem for you .
tim , uk when the various " stealth " taxes are taken into account -lrb- vat , national insurance - which is a tax by another name , tax on insurance , airport taxes , fuel taxes , alcohol taxes , capital gains tax , inheritance tax , stamp duty etc -rrb- are taken into account , we already pay around 65 % tax .
let the government look to its own inefficiencies and profligate waste before it tries to take still more from a population which is already one of the most heavily taxed in europe .
kate , england the 40 % tax rate should not be raised as it stands .
people on little over 30k a year , just a few thousand more than the average wage , already have to pay almost half their salary in taxes and should not penalised any further .
if anything tax rates for them should be lowered , as the jump from 22 % to 40 % is too high and a more progressive tax code introduced topping off at say 50 % for those earning over 75k .
meanwhile " sin taxes " on fatty and unhealthy food should be introduced to help curb the appalling rates of poverty amongst the poor .
it will take time to have an effect but will pay dividends in the long run .
lr , england compared to most of the other big economic countries we pay some of the lowest rates of tax .
fact !
so where will all our big earning bosses go and work if the uk raised taxes ?
germany where the highest rate of income tax is 51 % ?
france where the highest rate of income tax is 54 % ?
i guess they could go to italy where the highest rate is only 46 % !
in the netherlands the highest rate is 60 % .
plus most of these countries also pay higher rates of vat !
i wonder if all their government services are better than ours ?
food for thought !
steve , england we have to be prepared to pay our fair share of tax to improve services and quality of life of the vulnerable .
this means taxing the rich a little more and addressing their tax avoidance .
civilisation is expensive .
the vulgar personification of the inland revenue as " the taxman getting his hands on your cash " perpetuates our miserly , short-sighted attitudes .
tom phelan , uk " how about some serious accountability before taking more of my hard earned cash " antony , london , uk i am pretty sick of managing government wastage and inefficiency with the " quick fix " solution of yet another tax hike .
with 10 % ni contributions , 17.5 % vat , stamp duty , petrol tax , death duty , etc. plus one third of my salary gone from source .
where does it all go ?
how about some serious accountability before taking more of my hard earned cash .
they may as well incinerate half the money i currently pay over for all the good it does .
i would never agree to higher taxes until those in power prove they are using it responsibly .
antony , london , uk one aspect of poverty in the south east is that salaries no longer buy homes , and whilst this poverty trap continues we will see an increasing number of public service strikes , fire service and tube strikes could just be the beginning .
increasing interest rates and preventing people buying numerous buy-to-let properties would help to ease the problem .
tim , uk the problem is n't so much as the more well off paying tax , but making many employers pay living wage salaries .
there are too many companies out there expecting to pay £ 12,000 or less for what are quite demanding jobs .
i 'm sure such employers will bleat that they ca n't afford it , but why should the taxpayer subsidise them ?
phil cattermole , united kingdom my husband and i work over 80 hours a week between us , we do not have a car , we have given up smoking and we made a conscious decision not to have children which we felt we could not afford .
we do have a mortgage but we are considered well off because we are buying our own house .
we are fed up of continually having to bale out the " poor " - most of whom spend a lot of money on cigarettes , take away food and cars .
why does n't the government not take away child benefit from the well off people and redistribute it to the less well off people with children .
this benefit is the only benefit which is not means tested and it is given to rich and poor people alike .
marlene wodo , england i would not trust the government to distribute the money generated from higher taxation to the poor , it would simply be used to pay for their next election campaign .
so no way we pay far too much as it is for very little return , britain is still a rip off !
doug , london , uk the idea that slapping taxes on the rich will solve all the uk 's problems belongs in a student union , not in the real world !
peter , uk so apart from the 40 % i pay on my salary , the % 80 i pay on petrol , the 18 % vat , road tax , the tax on cigarettes and alcohol , how much more of my hard earned does this government want ?
and i really want to know what they spend it all on ?
rail companies are privatised , greatly reduced support for students , miniscule police force , more and more people in private healthcare ?
duncan , uk there is no need to increase the level of tax if you increase tax receipts by creating more wealth .
investing in britain , through infrastructure improvements and helping businesses .
help the poor by providing the opportunities for them to earn a good wage .
spencer dutton , brit in germany " re-introduction of the highest rate tax bands for very high earners would be a good starting point " steve , uk i think tax rises are a particularly grey area that most people agree are a good idea , if the money goes to the right places , and that the right people are taxed - as long as it 's not me paying .
re-introduction of the highest rate tax bands for very high earners would be a good starting point .
steve , uk does anybody realise that in the past 5 years since new labour came to power that the total tax pot has risen from £ 286 billion to nearer £ 500 billion per year .
we should all be asking where on earth all that money is going .
and then they have the cheek to demand more of our money .
gavin , uk more taxes ?
do we not pay enough already ?
i 'm a single hard working man , and i struggle every month .
i would n't expect anyone to help me out .
louis kabbani , uk " the idea of paying more tax to support poor people is abhorrent " james fownes , england the idea of paying more tax to support poor people is abhorrent , many of them are in the situation due to laziness and it would be unfair for the more successful elements of society to be expected to bolster them yet again .
james fownes , england james fownes .
i resent your charge that all people in poverty are layabouts who have not worked to better themselves .
bettering yourself is no guarantee of success today .
i am a recent university graduate in it , who spent over a year trying to find work .
395 -lrb- no exaggeration -rrb- applications later , i secured a job with a local authority on very poor wages considering my qualifications .
even now it is damn near impossible for me to save up enough money to afford a home of my own .
you thirty-something 's just think when you sit back in your luxurious , more or less already made lives .
would you want to be in the position of someone just starting out nowadays ?
i think not .
i expect lots of " the world does not owe you a living " comments from this post .
i will pre-empitvely reply by saying we do n't expect that .
we desire nothing more than a level playing field .
dan cochran , britain dan cochrain , your reply to james just serves to strengthen his point .
so you struggled to get a job ?
so did most of us " thirty somethings " , do you expect money to be thrown at you ?
so you ca n't afford a house ?
well neither could i until i had worked for over 8 years .
level playing field ?
there has never been a more level playing field , i fancy by " level " you actually mean nicely sloped in your favour so you have everything you could possibly want before you are 25 .
oh and by the by , who forced you to become an it specialist in the middle of an it downturn ?
bad judgement or just bad luck ?
it does n't matter , be patient , put some effort into developing yourself and you too can be a comfortably well off thirty something writing to talking point !
mark , uk education is how to prevent poverty .
if every kid in the country has a good education , then they will find it easier to get work and pull themselves out of poverty .
the other benefits of reduced crime and reduced welfare costs will mean more money to spare to improve education further .
education and the economy are linked in the long term .
stu , uk i am not an advocate of taxing the rich , but i believe that the 40 percent threshold should be raised to 45 or 50 percent .
the lower paid can not be expected to give more , without falling below the poverty line themselves .
and the middle classes must not be hammered again , so those that can afford it should pay a bit more .
i am sure that many would accept this providing the money was channelled to those in need , and not just lumped into the treasuries coffers .
baz , uk the redistribution of wealth is a great idea and should have been introduced a long time ago .
however , to raise the issue to the public is quite risky as the nation already does n't agree with his support for america , and the majority wo n't want their taxes raised .
especially since the nhs spending seems not to have made the slightest bit of difference .
angela , uk " i think many people forget how well off they really are " cc , scotland i certainly would n't mind paying extra tax for a better standard of living for all .
the common line of ' but i do n't trust the government with my money ' is a blatant excuse for those who are too mean and greedy to contribute a little more .
these are usually the same people who whinge about long nhs waiting lists sub-standard public facilities ! !
i think many people forget how well off they really are - they should be ashamed !
cc , scotland the problems with poverty are in part due to the disappearance of the traditional manual labour industries .
tax money should be spent to create new jobs for this sector .
heaven knows the road and rail infrastructure in this country could do with more people maintaining it .
euan gregory , scotland i ca n't believe the amount of poor excuses on this page to cover up people 's unwillingness to pay tax .
we do n't pay too much tax , in fact we pay a lot less than a lot of other countries .
if you want a decent country with good public services and welfare you have to pay for it , and that includes everyone .
i do think though that the super rich who avoid tax , illegally , should be locked up .
ambrose , uk " i already pay far too much tax " john , uk i work long hours in a high pressure job in the city .
i earn every penny that i am paid and i already pay far too much tax .
i grew up in a council house and my parents worked in a factory .
i have worked hard to get to my present position .
why should i pay more tax to subsidise those who have n't got the will power and self discipline to do the same ?
john , uk as a very low paid council worker our pension is the only thing that keeps us going .
at 31 i ca n't even afford to buy a house unlike some of those in this discussion .
so how am i supposed to fund the poor if i 'm already just above the poverty line myself ?
richard h , uk to put it simply - yes .
we all need to take some responsibility for those in out community who are less fortunate , for the most part through no fault of their own .
for some this may take the form of practical help within local communities , for others it might be to help a little more through taxes if they can afford it .
a penny on tax would not hurt anyone who is on average wage or above , provided the money was ring fenced only for handling poverty .
ian mcevoy , uk " there is a huge body of evidence linking poverty and lack of opportunity with crime " rich , uk it seems ironic on ' cracking crime day ' that so many of the comments seem to view poverty relief as being a purely altruistic affair .
there is a huge body of evidence linking poverty and lack of opportunity with crime , so any measures to alleviate the conditions of the poorest in society are of real benefit to us all .
tony blair should be applauded for his ideals even if the implementation is somewhat flawed .
rich , uk hell hath no fury like the middle classes being taxed .
steve perry , uk poverty is a scar on the uk left by 18 years of thatcherite tory government .
whilst the government has done a lot to reduce poverty in the uk over the past five years , through the introduction of measures like the working families tax credit and the minimum wage , the only way to really tackle the problem is to increase taxes - something that i would welcome .
malcolm powers , uk " poverty then was poverty " eddie o 'riordan , uk we pay enough direct and indirect taxation already - and what is poverty now ?
colour tv , video and running an old banger .
i came to this country from ireland in the 50 's and poverty then was poverty .
since then i have worked hard to get what i now own and i am not redistributing it to anybody .
eddie o 'riordan , uk the simple reason for poverty in the uk is that there are too many people out there who are out of work , who are being paid an unfair wage for a hard day 's work or are merely pensioners .
this is not related to taxation but to the gross misspending of the fiscal budgets by our elected and unelected officials , from councils to national government .
john , scotland , uk while it is tempting to think that tax can be made painless by merely taxing the rich , the trouble is that there are just not enough rich around .
high taxes simply cause them to leave the country .
the bulk of taxes have to be paid by the bulk of the population which means mr and mrs average .
patrick stevens , uk " make it possible for people to get rich " john sinton , usa it is always the suggestion that the way to help the poor is to tax the wealthy .
but the truth is that taxing money is a root cause of the problem .
make it possible for people to get rich is the answer , like in the usa .
if history has taught the us anything in the last 20 years , it has been to reduce government tinkering with the economy .
john sinton , usa by all means help but let 's tax those who can afford to pay .
years ago there used to be higher taxation for high earners .
let 's see that system reintroduced as a starting point .
david atkinson , england we will all be living in poverty if we have to pay much more tax .
dave , uk " hopelessness is a very difficult cycle to break " df , uk i come from a poor background but , luckily for me , my family culture was to work hard to better your position in life .
i am now what many might consider middle class -lrb- owning my own home is something my parents were never able to achieve -rrb- .
i realise that this ' redistribution of wealth ' is likely to hit my pocket , but if it guaranteed that children from a less ambitious background might be able to believe they can make something of themselves , then i am prepared to pay .
hopelessness is a very difficult cycle to break .
df , uk the redistribution of wealth through taxation currently benefits the rich .
billionaires like rupert murdoch avoid tax in this country , effectively being subsidised by the rest of us .
huge subsidies go to arms manufacturers and dealers .
we all pay plenty of tax .
just look at how it is spent and you find where the real problems of distribution lie ...
duncan drury , london , uk perhaps mr blair can take the money he was going to spend on invading iraq and instead spend it on something useful in the uk .
james , uk " governments prefer quick fix solutions " matt , uk money spent on tackling root causes of problems does n't yield quick results .
it may be years or even decades before the benefits filter through to society in general by which time someone else is likely to be in power .
governments prefer quick fix solutions to paper over the problems rather than address the real issues .
common sense tells us that prevention is better than cure but our government staggers on apparently oblivious to this .
matt , uk i was in a supermarket yesterday , stuck in a queue behind a young woman of about 20 .
she was chatting away to her friend while trying -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- to control a toddler and a baby .
part of her conversation was about the dss refusing to pay for new shoes for the toddler .
her shopping basket included piles of frozen ready-meals , sweets and crisps - hardly the cheapest option .
but the worst of it was that she also had a pack of 200 cigarettes in her basket !
while i do n't really care who smokes or not , i find it astounding that she believes the state should care for her children while she spends her welfare money on fast food and cigarettes .
alan , uk sorry , i do n't see the relationship between more tax to the government and less poverty .
ban advertising which persuades people to buy things they do not need and can not afford .
clive , uk " it might be a good idea to review how our existing taxes are currently spent " hugh , uk do you mean more taxes on top of those i already pay to fund mps ' pay rises and final salary index-linked pensions ?
perhaps it might be a good idea to review how our existing taxes are currently spent , without squeezing the poor taxpayer for ever-increasing amounts .
hugh , uk i already pay nearly £ 1,000 a month in tax .
is that not enough ?
the government should target people rich enough to hire accountants to hide money offshore .
oliver richardson , uk start taxing the super-rich fatcats before you pick on the people that do the real work in this county thanks .
how about a 50 % tax band for incomes over 100k ?
that would be a start .
rob , uk very little of the billions gained from taxes on drivers ever get put back into the system .
why should we believe that an extra penny on the pound will be spent on poverty ?
chris , uk " it is not a long term solution " jm , uk the question assumes that by paying more tax we can ease the problem of poverty .
i have my doubts about this .
certainly it may alleviate some of the symptoms of poverty in the short run .
however it is not a long term solution .
i have worked as a mentor to a young man from a very poor family and i can tell you that his predicament was caused and is perpetuated by poor decisions made by his single parent mother .
if the money is to be spent on anything it should be pumped into education , including sex education , so that young people do not have 6 children by 3 different -lrb- and absent -rrb- fathers .
jm , uk i do n't mind paying extra for essential services .
however many welfare programmes actually keep people in poverty .
also i do not trust our government to redistribute my money fairly .
surely the best way would be to lower income tax for low paid workers .
philip shorter , england like a lot of people in this country i would agree with this in principle ; the problem is that i can not trust this or any government to target that money effectively and efficiently .
and as phil t alluded to , do we really want to spend £ 4.5 billion on a war to keep the rest of the world " safe " ?
andy , scotland there is no need to increase taxes to help reduce poverty in the uk .
all we have to do is stop trying to play policemen of the world , invest the money spent on corrupt foreign governments back into our society , stop paying so much to euro mps , cut out all of the european bureaucracy , stop supporting white elephants like the dome and give politicians a huge pay cut .

a third of british youngsters are living in poverty , says a major study by charity save the children .
the wellbeing of children in the uk report says children 's quality of life increasingly depends on where they live , but the problems are far more serious in isolated pockets of england and scotland .
obesity , homelessness , traffic and fewer chances for free play are also identified by the charity as growing problems in some areas .
the report was carried out by the university of york and has been described as the first ever comprehensive study of the state of children in the uk .
what can be done to reduce child poverty in the uk ?
where is the best place to bring up children ?
tell us what you think .
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below . "
if it 's not poverty , it 's intense competition " jon , uk / canada i think the pressures on kids and parents are overwhelming in the uk .
if it 's not poverty , it 's intense competition that causes problems .
children should be allowed to enjoy their childhood as much as possible .
i think that 's getting tricky in the uk .
jon , uk / canada with parents who balance spending as much time as possible with them and setting a good example by working hard and bettering society in some way .
in a home that does not have a tv .
in an area that is not a large population centre .
in a country that takes seriously securing its citizens ' liberty and freedoms .
that place is where i believe growing up is most healthy .
bill , colorado , usa " in the uk , problems are the result of many things , but poverty is not one of them " graham , warsaw , poland i taught in a nepalese village .
most parents could n't afford the $ 1.50 a week the school charged to cover costs .
the kids had no shoes , no glasses -lrb- where needed -rrb- , no sports equipment , no books , almost no paper and the head was ultra-protective about chalk consumption .
in the uk , problems are the result of many things , but poverty is not one of them .
graham , warsaw , poland the best place to bring up a child is in a country that has adequate welfare , education and healthcare systems .
so anywhere in europe apart from the uk then .
david howe , uk what is our great country coming to ?
i have gradually seen britain fall to its knees over the years .
crime is soaring .
traditional family values , as regarded by the ignorant " blairite " generation , are seen as too old-fashioned .
i 'll tell you a cure for this degradation , remove the wishy-washy " social apologists " from power and bring back a firm hand !
elizabeth hampshire , england anywhere that has no tv advertising , no small-minded soaps , no gambling outlets , no credit cards or store credit , but has a decent wage for a day 's work , decent affordable housing , clean water , a lack of crime , good education and support from the community , formal or otherwise , and a community spirit .
randy , uk the best way to combat poverty in children is to educate their parents and to make parents more responsible for their own action that impact on their children as well as their children 's own behaviour .
this would not just tackle child poverty but also many of the anti-social behaviour problems we find in young people today .
glenn jordan , uk " if kids are made to feel worthy , whatever they have , they have a chance of happiness " anthony , london , uk first of all , living in some sort of poverty does n't necessarily mean you will turn out to be a criminal or be unhappy or uneducated .
one major problem is the way those kids are treated by their peers , and the rest of society .
there is no miracle because whatever is done , there will always be people living in standards far below that of some others .
it is only when these people are made to feel worthless , inadequate , rejects of society , that the problems really start .
that 's when the violence , delinquency , crime , skipping school , etc comes into play .
if kids are made to feel worthy , whatever they have , they have a chance of happiness .
anthony , london , uk education and knowledge have always been key , because without them children and young adults will not be armed with the ability to make positive choices - as opposed to having few or no choices .
unfortunately , with the inverted snobbery that exists among many so-called working class people in particular , uneducated parents will raise uneducated children and the cycle continues .
how often have you heard an audience on a tv show , e.g. blind date , go " ooooh " in the most sarcastic manner when a contestant says they attend university ?
or if someone " admits " to having a better than average job ?
one reads and hears of " role models " who claim never to have a read a book , as if this is something to be proud of , when the exact opposite is true .
eliminate attitudes like these , and the chances of making progress towards eradicating poverty will improve .
tony , nl lack of money / possessions is not a major problem in the uk , but there are far too many unhappy children -lrb- and adults -rrb- in this country for other reasons , and this is the real poverty .
stefan kilpatrick , uk in my experience , it does n't matter so much where as how .
having been the product of a one-parent set-up , i know that if i had n't been evacuated to a loving caring couple , i could have had a very twisted outlook on life .
luckily they brought me up in my formative years and made me convinced that it is so important to have two people who you believe love you and care about you .
i do n't think one-parent families can do that as there are two many stresses on that one .
also , a child needs the stability of one constant father they can relate to , learn from and trust implicitly for the best possible start in life .
juliet , cornwall what saddens me is the number of children in the uk condemned to dead-end existences by their parents ' anti-education attitudes .
we saw some of this in the recent debate about what constitutes working class .
at a recent parents ' evening about how to help your child 's education , only five people out of 80 turned up and they are the same five who always do because they care about their kids ' future .
d , uk in a place where people have healthy mentalities , where the air is clean , food is non-contaminated and where they can run around free from intrusive advertising and perverts .
new zealand it is then .
elizabeth coldwell-hall , england in a good christian home following sound christian principles ! !
lee , uk " couples should have to prove their ability to support a child " faith , uk some degree of child poverty is always going to exist while we are supporting lazy people who do n't want to work in their ' right to have children ' .
i believe couples should have to prove their ability to support and nurture a child in all ways , not just financially , before they can have children .
faith , uk the idea that a third of british children are living in poverty is , frankly , an insult to the millions of really poverty stricken families the world over .
this sort of definition of poverty merely makes the word " poverty " have less meaning , and there is a great danger therefore that we underestimate the suffering of real poverty .
giles , uk " child poverty in the uk is about not having three meals a day " sam , uk has anyone read the report ?
child poverty in the uk is about not having three meals a day or a proper coat in the winter or shoes that fit - surely these are basic fundamental needs .
the report is n't talking about those children who do n't have satellite tv or flash trainers .
people and the government need to take their heads out of the sand and recognise that the uk has a problem , with a third of children living in poverty .
sam , uk i simply wish parents and adults could for a short moment be made to see through the eyes of a child who is mistreated , underprivileged , unloved , not wanted .
we can blame governments , " wrong areas to live " until forever , but the reality is that we , you and the adults , the parents , i are more to blame than anyone or anything else .
until we change as a people , i am afraid it will simply get worse .
gary , uk it saddens me to hear the extent of child poverty in the uk .
there can never enough solutions to poverty .
however meaningful education and strong family values can seriously dent the poverty line .
augustus amedee , st lucia " more resources need to be put into educating people in controlling what they have " rob o 'donnell , england many of the problems of poverty are not due to lack of money , but the lack of ability to control it .
it 's too easy to find cash in your pocket and spend it , then get in trouble when the next bill comes in .
more resources need to be put into educating people in controlling what they have .
i fear however this will take some considerable time to work ; the present spend-spend-spend culture is not easily overturned .
rob o 'donnell , england a main long-term problems is that many of their parents would have suffered during the 1980s / early 1990s and may well have been in areas where it was quite simply impossible to get a job .
t hese parents are " damaged " now , quite often having low self-esteem due to experiences from when they were much younger .
whether they know it or not they pass some of this on to their children .
i speak as someone who went through this period but was lucky enough to realise that life did n't have to be what i saw around me .
john , uk nothing changes , the rich get rich , and the poor get nothing .
it 's the system .
glyn roughsedge , frodsham , uk talk , talk , talk .
i 'm as guilty as the next person for talk .
to quote eliza doolittle : " show me . "
we 'll each have to give more money and time .
if we can help at least one child , that 's one step up for humanity .
let 's get busy .
s. small , usa " we should contribute more towards general taxation " margaret , scotland if poverty is defined as a state of being inferior , we can go on to consider how to cope with improving the lot of british children who are locked in a cycle of inferior housing , education , diet and exercise .
many lack the support of a good role model .
a more egalitarian tax system -lrb- vat is disadvantageous to the poor , but easily affordable for the rich -rrb- , free and healthy school meals for all , after-school sports clubs and tutorial classes would improve the cycle of inferiority that so many british children experience .
if we are serious about improving their situation , we should contribute more towards general taxation .
margaret , scotland why do we constantly talk about reducing ' child poverty ' when the thing the government is obsessed with measuring and tackling is ' child inequality ' ?
another wonderful left-wing dream which i thought had been reduced to the dustbin of uk political history after the disaster that was the 1970s and early 1980s .
nigel , uk " the most important thing we can give our children is our time " pat welch , usa i think that children in the uk would be a lot better off if more mothers stayed at home to look after them .
the most important thing we can give our children is our time , not the material things money can buy .
if we give them our love and time they will feel really valued .
pat welch , usa as one of a married couple with four well-balanced grown children , i wholly agree with many of the comments regarding the benefits of a stable family background .
for one thing , the state should reward -lrb- via tax breaks -rrb- parents who stay together to raise their children .
louise , uk louise , uk - get real !
there are many reasons why families split up , to give tax relief to those lucky enough to stay together is absurd !
the children usually get left with the parent that cares and to tax this parent because they just happened to marry someone without the same morals as them is just stupid .
leon , wales " in many cases there is simply not enough money to go round " danni , england it is pretty obvious that poverty is relative .
in a country as wealthy and sophisticated as ours it is simply unacceptable that children suffer poverty .
although it is important to remember that a loving family can provide support , it is also important to remember that children do not have control over money , how it is spent , or how much comes in .
in many cases there is simply not enough money to go round , especially in areas where the cost of living is high .
danni , england plenty of people are poor , i was .
had i been subjected as a child to the terrible battering of advertisements that amount these days to little more than child exploitation , i probably too would have put pressure on my parents who had no money .
children can be poor and happy , but not when they see their rich friends having things they see on tv .
unfortunately this means slightly less world trade , and so will not happen .
ian , uk the best way to reduce child poverty is to give parents tax incentives to stay -lrb- or get -rrb- married and to enable a parent to choose to stay at home with the child during its formative years .
hugh , uk i have read all the comments from the middle class readers who have access to the internet .
maybe they should try living a week on a council estate in bradford .
julie garvey , canada the number of comments belittling this report amazes me !
this country has a major problem , with some areas exceptionally deprived , not just of money but of hope and purpose .
we need to get rid of the attitude that the third world are always worse off .
where else is the suicide rate so high ?
our society is disintegrating , we need more encouragement for marriage and the traditional family unit .
rog c , uk " ca n't we look at humanity as a whole ? "
jane , uk why is it some contributors feel " compassion " about the third world and yet feel nothing for contempt for our own british children who often , through no fault of their own , are disadvantaged from before they are born ?
i feel desperate for third world children and families too but ca n't we look at humanity as a whole and not be so quick to talk about british / western kids as mere brats who sit behind a computer .
jane , uk does this study tell us how many poverty-stricken children live in families where one or both parents can still " afford " to drink and smoke themselves to oblivion ?
in short , how much difference would a change in parental perspectives make ?
alan green , germany channelling money through the education system will ensure that children enjoy the best of it - better teaching facilities , sports facilities , books and computers in the schools ' libraries , after school activities - and this will have a direct result on the long term development of the children .
alex liang , london uk real child poverty hardly exists at all in the uk .
but what is evident is the kind of mental poverty provided by broken homes and simply bad parents .
james , uk " the real issue here is the decay of the fabric of society and parenting in the uk " peter , singapore like others i found this report ludicrous to the point of being obnoxious considering the desperate plight of many children here in asia .
the real issue here is the decay of the fabric of society and parenting in the uk .
even the poorest family in the developing world will grasp opportunities and remain optimistic .
many in the uk seem pre-occupied with grumbling about state handouts and where the next packet of cigarettes are coming from .
peter , singapore how are we encouraging the less privileged in our society - by asking them to gamble what little they have on a weekly lottery .
children are all born with innocence and a vulnerability that is often lost too soon because of dreadful parenting .
often the children are unwanted from birth and unloved .
let 's seriously address birth control and parenting skills and in time we may not need to have further debates on child poverty .
r.c. robjohn , uk benefits have been rising steadily for fifty years , apparently without any dent in " poverty " -lrb- at least in the purely relative terms described here -rrb- .
the effect , perhaps by encouraging young , single parents , may even have been perverse .
single parenthood is the clearest correlate of child poverty .
ben , england " child poverty that would break your heart " john , uk child poverty , what is that then ?
not being able to afford the latest high tech pair of trainers or the latest mobile phone for a seven year old ?
i recently travelled around cambodia and believe me that was child poverty that would break your heart .
john , uk as a scot married to a turk , living in turkey with our daughter , i have to agree with john , uk .
what child poverty ?
i do n't think kids have ever been so lucky !
perhaps the government should provide each child in the uk with a trip to a developing country .
maybe then the nation as a whole would stop taking free education , the nhs , a social benefits system and food and water for granted and realize just how fortunate they are .
barbara , turkey i am shocked and saddened by the lack of awareness and compassion other contributors have exhibited towards the scale of child poverty in the uk and throughout the west .
the reality is not one of satellite tv and expensive trainers - although parents do face unrealistic social pressures to conform and purchase such items .
sadly it is that thousands of children in the uk , as in many other ' developed countries ' live in extreme poverty and on a daily basis face tremendous institutional and physical abuse .
matthew m , usa / uk educate the parents - i live in a " deprived " area of north manchester and without doubt , education is the answer .
mia , uk " leon , wales " is the one who needs to get real .
it 's not luck that keeps a family together but hard work and patience .
if the government would try rewarding that hard work rather than the lazy irresponsible " rights " -based parasites then there would be more reason to make the effort .
frank , england " it was the close family bond we shared that meant we had a happy childhood " jennifer , uk as a child i lived in various places -lrb- cities and villages -rrb- as we moved around a lot because of my father 's job .
it did n't make a blind bit of difference where we lived - it was the close family bond we shared that meant we had a happy childhood .
we were n't rich - a family of seven in a three-bedroom rented house , no tv , no car .
how can people talk of poverty in this country ?
nobody starves here like in the third world .
i have come to realise that poverty in the western world means not having the " right " designer trainers or taking a holiday in a caravan instead of florida .
however , children do not need to be surrounded by material things as much as they need a stable , loving environment .
jennifer , uk we need to get rid of the attitude that the third world are always worse off .
where else is the suicide rate so high ?
this country has got a major problem , with some areas exceptionally deprived , not just of money but of hope and purpose .
our society is disintegrating , we need more encouragement for marriage and the traditional family unit .
rog c , uk if people are going to be given more money -lrb- increases in benefits -rrb- then a minority will abuse the system and use the money not to buy clothes and food for their children , but use it for their own enjoyment - more money means newer cars , dvd players , etc .
children will still be poorer .
i think we should make sure that every child who is found to be eligible should be given tokens to be exchanged for food and clothing and not give this in a form of cash .
sharon , uk the best place to bring up a child - i would put aside any geographical location and say a child is best placed to be brought up well in a home where there are preferably two parents of both genders who are prepared to put their time , efforts , and money into that child and then they can think about themselves .
sorry to sound hard , and of course , life is not composed of perfect scenarios , but so many do rush into pregnancy without thinking about what is best for the child .
marie cameron , uk why rely on the government to protect the children ?
it 's the parent 's job .
and the best way to reduce child poverty is not to have a child until you have the resources to provide it with food , warmth , a home and a stable environment .
the only answer to this is for all the adults in the uk to stop being so selfish and irresponsible , and stop having children until they can provide for them .
without this , anything else will fail .
kathy , uk even as someone who has no kids at the moment , i have thought about this in the past .
i have decided due to the state of this country at the moment , and with no real hope of any miraculous turn-arounds in british society , that should i have kids , it wo n't be in britain .
i have already applied to emigrate and have every intention of being elsewhere by the time i start a family !
david white , scotland i believe that the uk is one of the most violent , dirty , unwelcoming countries in the western world .
iain , uk " child " poverty " in britain is miniscule when compared to global problems " dan m , canada what should be done ?
nothing , in the uk , that is .
are these " poor " british children starving ?
then there is nothing to worry about .
child " poverty " in britain and other western countries is miniscule when compared to the global problems this world faces .
dan m , canada poverty is relative .
compared to many places in world i agree that we do not have ' poverty ' .
but you have to look at this in the context of the general living standards of this country .
there are many children out there who have only have one set of clothes , their houses do not have telephones or carpets and if they have a television and -lrb- it is not likely to be satellite in the poorest homes -rrb- to watch who can blame them for wanting some escapism ?
it 's fine to say , well you should n't have children if you ca n't afford them but that does n't actually help the children living out there .
sam , uk i grew up next to fields and woods and ca n't imagine a childhood without that .
it 's not all about fresh air and running around , it 's also about entertaining yourself with whatever is there .
and it was this , rather than growing up glued to a computer console that was the defining part of my childhood .
wendy , uk the best place to bring up children is in a community that values people and learning .
this can be anywhere in the world if we want it to be so .
mark , uk " the best indicator of future success is whether there is a stable family behind them " ian t , uk as ian duncan smith said on friday , considering child poverty in financial terms alone is ' one-dimensional ' .
far more important is the love , respect , support , encouragement and consistent and fair treatment from both parents .
the best indicator of future success is whether there is a stable family behind them .
ian t , uk without a doubt northern scotland , or even better on one of the islands .
children there do not get sick , or suffer from obesity as they eat fresh food , and due to the culture of ' it takes a whole village to bring up a child ' , the children are cared for by every one .
eileen , uk a stable home environment is more important than anything else .
we need to promote families growing together and staying together .
do n't have kids to try to make a relationship work , it does n't !
city life is not a good place to start but its never going to be possible to give all children a home in shetland !
sorry eileen ! ! !
as adults and parents , we have the power to help our offspring make the best of their lives , whatever the financial or local circumstances .
dave , kent uk " keep them away from cities , air pollution and people pollution ! ! ! "
peter finch , england children need clean air , and safe open spaces to play if they are to grow up healthy .
so the worst place to bring them up is a city with air pollution and too many dodgy characters .
the south coast or open countryside is the best place to grow up , because children will learn more good than bad from the clean and wholesome lifestyle .
keep them away from cities , air pollution and people pollution ! ! !
peter finch , england if the government are serious about reducing child poverty , then let us see reductions in tax , vat , interest rates and inflation .
let us also see regular , structured pay increases in all jobs across the board .
the government cause poverty with all their money grabbing techniques and businesses help by paying low wages .
