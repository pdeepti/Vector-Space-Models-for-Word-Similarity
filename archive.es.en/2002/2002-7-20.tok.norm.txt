but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .
" it ’ s perfect , " hoeneß says pointing to the chances for improving the soccer market in the future .

germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .
after buying a roll with rissole from the snack bar next door , you can enter into the sparsely decorated worship room of the chapel and browse the prayer book .
it includes entries from people like " trucker heinz , " who is praying for his girlfriend gabi to come back to him .
god 's own gps system germany 's 21 autobahn churches and chapels are a great place to take a little time out for reflection .
truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .
typically german ?
vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .

when " trucker heinz " got dumped by his girlfriend , he turned to one of germany 's 21 autobahn churches for a little heavenly help . instead of pulling out a candy bar at rest stops , more and more german travelers are ditching vice in favor of god .
germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .
after buying a roll with rissole from the snack bar next door , you can enter into the sparsely decorated worship room of the chapel and browse the prayer book .
it includes entries from people like " trucker heinz , " who is praying for his girlfriend gabi to come back to him .
god 's own gps system germany 's 21 autobahn churches and chapels are a great place to take a little time out for reflection .
truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .
typically german ?
vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .
that may have been what brought trucker heinz to medenbach .
and maybe , just maybe , gabi 's returned to him by now . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

when " trucker heinz " got dumped by his girlfriend , he turned to one of germany 's 21 autobahn churches for a little heavenly help . instead of pulling out a candy bar at rest stops , more and more german travelers are ditching vice in favor of god .
germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .
after buying a roll with rissole from the snack bar next door , you can enter into the sparsely decorated worship room of the chapel and browse the prayer book .
it includes entries from people like " trucker heinz , " who is praying for his girlfriend gabi to come back to him .
god 's own gps system germany 's 21 autobahn churches and chapels are a great place to take a little time out for reflection .
truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .
typically german ?
vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .
that may have been what brought trucker heinz to medenbach .
and maybe , just maybe , gabi 's returned to him by now . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .
" it ’ s perfect , " hoeneß says pointing to the chances for improving the soccer market in the future .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .
" it ’ s perfect , " hoeneß says pointing to the chances for improving the soccer market in the future .
" finally , reason and caution have entered the picture . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .

germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .
after buying a roll with rissole from the snack bar next door , you can enter into the sparsely decorated worship room of the chapel and browse the prayer book .
it includes entries from people like " trucker heinz , " who is praying for his girlfriend gabi to come back to him .
god 's own gps system germany 's 21 autobahn churches and chapels are a great place to take a little time out for reflection .
truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .
typically german ?
vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .

germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .

between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .
typically german ?
vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .

when " trucker heinz " got dumped by his girlfriend , he turned to one of germany 's 21 autobahn churches for a little heavenly help . instead of pulling out a candy bar at rest stops , more and more german travelers are ditching vice in favor of god .
germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .
after buying a roll with rissole from the snack bar next door , you can enter into the sparsely decorated worship room of the chapel and browse the prayer book .
it includes entries from people like " trucker heinz , " who is praying for his girlfriend gabi to come back to him .
god 's own gps system germany 's 21 autobahn churches and chapels are a great place to take a little time out for reflection .
truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .
typically german ?
vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .
that may have been what brought trucker heinz to medenbach .
and maybe , just maybe , gabi 's returned to him by now . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

the last several weeks have seen a spate of arrests and detentions of suspected al qaeda operatives in europe .
this week four suspected members of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network were arrested in spain . the hunt for al qaeda operatives in europe met with some success this week , as european authorities in several countries continue their hunt for al qaeda terrorists , many of whom are believed to have used europe as a base of operations in the lead-up to the september 11 attacks in the u.s. spanish authorities this week arrested four men they suspect of being linked with the terror organization .
on tuesday , three men were taken into custody , two in madrid and one in the eastern city of castellon .
the men , all of syrian origin , are described as being members of a qaeda cell active in spain since 1994 .
police found videotapes belonging to one of the suspects that included footage of the world trade center , showing the twin towers from various angles and distances .
the tapes also showed san francisco ’ s golden gate bridge , the sears tower in chicago , new york ’ s empire state building and brooklyn bridge , as well as two california theme parks including disneyland .
the video footage included shots of bridge supports and , according to spain ’ s interior minister , were " obviously not what a tourist would make . "
the tapes , which were recorded five years ago , also show terrorist training exercises , such as attacks on tanks and the use of human shields .
spanish police said the images strongly suggest planning for the september 11 attacks dated back years and included scouting of other possible targets .
in the wake of the find , officials in san francisco doubled security at the golden gate bridge , one of the most famous landmarks in the u.s. , and a structure which carries more than 100,000 vehicles per day .
on wednesday , spanish police arrested a fourth suspect , identified as kamal hadid chaar , alias abu nour , who authorities suspect is involved with the organization ’ s financial activities .
" it wouldn ’ t surprise me if there are detentions in the near future of other individuals , connected to the previous ones , who are partners in some cases in economic operations , " police spokesman jose maria seara told reuters .
the four arrests this week are part of an operation started by spanish police last november , bringing the number total number of arrests of al qaeda suspects in spain to 24 .
italian forgers in milan , italian police arrested eight men on july 12 suspected of providing false identity papers for members of al qaeda , including some of the hijackers who carried out the september 11 attacks .
all but one were muslims from north africa .
one other suspect managed to escape the authorities .
massimo mazza , head of milan ’ s special operations investigation team , said the eight suspects provided the " vital underground cover needed by terrorist criminals , " and that the suspects had links with another group of document forgers .
u.s. officials believe that an islamic cultural center in milan served as al qaeda ’ s main european base .
muslim leaders have denied the accusation .
german radicals on july 3 , german police raided a several apartments and a bookstore in the city of hamburg , the northern port city in which suspected september 11 ringleader mohammed atta and at least two other conspirators lived quietly as sleepers and attended university in the years before the attacks .
seven suspected islamic radicals were detained in the sweeps , which authorities described as a pre-emptive strike against a group attempting to build a new terrorist cell there .
the men were aged 28 to 51 and included moroccans , egyptians , afghans and one german citizen .
they met regularly at the attawhid bookshop near the mosque in hamburg where atta prayed along with other members of the terrorist cell he led .
german authorities said the men had been heard saying they wanted " to give their lives for islam " although it is not clear whether the men belong to the al qaeda network .
one of men detained , abdelghani mzoudi , a 29-year-old citizen of the united arab emirates , was at one time atta ’ s former roommate in an apartment on marien street .
it is believed that the u.s. attacks may have been planned from this apartment in a quiet middle-class neighborhood .
the seven detained men were later released as police said there was not enough evidence that they were planning to commit terrorist acts , thereby repeating a pattern , criticized by the u.s. , where suspects are detained in raids and quickly freed .
but german officials defend the methods , saying such a strike is a way to rattle suspects and put them on notice that they are being watched , even though police might not yet have enough evidence to convict them before a court of law .
only one person , mounir motassadeq , an associate of atta ’ s , has been formally arrested in germany in connection direct with the september 11th attacks .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .

the last several weeks have seen a spate of arrests and detentions of suspected al qaeda operatives in europe .
this week four suspected members of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network were arrested in spain . the hunt for al qaeda operatives in europe met with some success this week , as european authorities in several countries continue their hunt for al qaeda terrorists , many of whom are believed to have used europe as a base of operations in the lead-up to the september 11 attacks in the u.s. spanish authorities this week arrested four men they suspect of being linked with the terror organization .
on tuesday , three men were taken into custody , two in madrid and one in the eastern city of castellon .
the men , all of syrian origin , are described as being members of a qaeda cell active in spain since 1994 .
police found videotapes belonging to one of the suspects that included footage of the world trade center , showing the twin towers from various angles and distances .
the tapes also showed san francisco ’ s golden gate bridge , the sears tower in chicago , new york ’ s empire state building and brooklyn bridge , as well as two california theme parks including disneyland .
the video footage included shots of bridge supports and , according to spain ’ s interior minister , were " obviously not what a tourist would make . "
the tapes , which were recorded five years ago , also show terrorist training exercises , such as attacks on tanks and the use of human shields .
spanish police said the images strongly suggest planning for the september 11 attacks dated back years and included scouting of other possible targets .
in the wake of the find , officials in san francisco doubled security at the golden gate bridge , one of the most famous landmarks in the u.s. , and a structure which carries more than 100,000 vehicles per day .
on wednesday , spanish police arrested a fourth suspect , identified as kamal hadid chaar , alias abu nour , who authorities suspect is involved with the organization ’ s financial activities .
" it wouldn ’ t surprise me if there are detentions in the near future of other individuals , connected to the previous ones , who are partners in some cases in economic operations , " police spokesman jose maria seara told reuters .
the four arrests this week are part of an operation started by spanish police last november , bringing the number total number of arrests of al qaeda suspects in spain to 24 .
italian forgers in milan , italian police arrested eight men on july 12 suspected of providing false identity papers for members of al qaeda , including some of the hijackers who carried out the september 11 attacks .
all but one were muslims from north africa .
one other suspect managed to escape the authorities .
massimo mazza , head of milan ’ s special operations investigation team , said the eight suspects provided the " vital underground cover needed by terrorist criminals , " and that the suspects had links with another group of document forgers .
u.s. officials believe that an islamic cultural center in milan served as al qaeda ’ s main european base .
muslim leaders have denied the accusation .
german radicals on july 3 , german police raided a several apartments and a bookstore in the city of hamburg , the northern port city in which suspected september 11 ringleader mohammed atta and at least two other conspirators lived quietly as sleepers and attended university in the years before the attacks .
seven suspected islamic radicals were detained in the sweeps , which authorities described as a pre-emptive strike against a group attempting to build a new terrorist cell there .
the men were aged 28 to 51 and included moroccans , egyptians , afghans and one german citizen .
they met regularly at the attawhid bookshop near the mosque in hamburg where atta prayed along with other members of the terrorist cell he led .
german authorities said the men had been heard saying they wanted " to give their lives for islam " although it is not clear whether the men belong to the al qaeda network .
one of men detained , abdelghani mzoudi , a 29-year-old citizen of the united arab emirates , was at one time atta ’ s former roommate in an apartment on marien street .
it is believed that the u.s. attacks may have been planned from this apartment in a quiet middle-class neighborhood .
the seven detained men were later released as police said there was not enough evidence that they were planning to commit terrorist acts , thereby repeating a pattern , criticized by the u.s. , where suspects are detained in raids and quickly freed .
but german officials defend the methods , saying such a strike is a way to rattle suspects and put them on notice that they are being watched , even though police might not yet have enough evidence to convict them before a court of law .
only one person , mounir motassadeq , an associate of atta ’ s , has been formally arrested in germany in connection direct with the september 11th attacks .
he has been accused of supporting a terrorist group . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .

the last several weeks have seen a spate of arrests and detentions of suspected al qaeda operatives in europe .
this week four suspected members of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network were arrested in spain . the hunt for al qaeda operatives in europe met with some success this week , as european authorities in several countries continue their hunt for al qaeda terrorists , many of whom are believed to have used europe as a base of operations in the lead-up to the september 11 attacks in the u.s. spanish authorities this week arrested four men they suspect of being linked with the terror organization .
on tuesday , three men were taken into custody , two in madrid and one in the eastern city of castellon .
the men , all of syrian origin , are described as being members of a qaeda cell active in spain since 1994 .
police found videotapes belonging to one of the suspects that included footage of the world trade center , showing the twin towers from various angles and distances .
the tapes also showed san francisco ’ s golden gate bridge , the sears tower in chicago , new york ’ s empire state building and brooklyn bridge , as well as two california theme parks including disneyland .
the video footage included shots of bridge supports and , according to spain ’ s interior minister , were " obviously not what a tourist would make . "
the tapes , which were recorded five years ago , also show terrorist training exercises , such as attacks on tanks and the use of human shields .
spanish police said the images strongly suggest planning for the september 11 attacks dated back years and included scouting of other possible targets .
in the wake of the find , officials in san francisco doubled security at the golden gate bridge , one of the most famous landmarks in the u.s. , and a structure which carries more than 100,000 vehicles per day .
on wednesday , spanish police arrested a fourth suspect , identified as kamal hadid chaar , alias abu nour , who authorities suspect is involved with the organization ’ s financial activities .
" it wouldn ’ t surprise me if there are detentions in the near future of other individuals , connected to the previous ones , who are partners in some cases in economic operations , " police spokesman jose maria seara told reuters .
the four arrests this week are part of an operation started by spanish police last november , bringing the number total number of arrests of al qaeda suspects in spain to 24 .
italian forgers in milan , italian police arrested eight men on july 12 suspected of providing false identity papers for members of al qaeda , including some of the hijackers who carried out the september 11 attacks .
all but one were muslims from north africa .
one other suspect managed to escape the authorities .
massimo mazza , head of milan ’ s special operations investigation team , said the eight suspects provided the " vital underground cover needed by terrorist criminals , " and that the suspects had links with another group of document forgers .
u.s. officials believe that an islamic cultural center in milan served as al qaeda ’ s main european base .
muslim leaders have denied the accusation .
german radicals on july 3 , german police raided a several apartments and a bookstore in the city of hamburg , the northern port city in which suspected september 11 ringleader mohammed atta and at least two other conspirators lived quietly as sleepers and attended university in the years before the attacks .
seven suspected islamic radicals were detained in the sweeps , which authorities described as a pre-emptive strike against a group attempting to build a new terrorist cell there .
the men were aged 28 to 51 and included moroccans , egyptians , afghans and one german citizen .
they met regularly at the attawhid bookshop near the mosque in hamburg where atta prayed along with other members of the terrorist cell he led .
german authorities said the men had been heard saying they wanted " to give their lives for islam " although it is not clear whether the men belong to the al qaeda network .
one of men detained , abdelghani mzoudi , a 29-year-old citizen of the united arab emirates , was at one time atta ’ s former roommate in an apartment on marien street .
it is believed that the u.s. attacks may have been planned from this apartment in a quiet middle-class neighborhood .
the seven detained men were later released as police said there was not enough evidence that they were planning to commit terrorist acts , thereby repeating a pattern , criticized by the u.s. , where suspects are detained in raids and quickly freed .
but german officials defend the methods , saying such a strike is a way to rattle suspects and put them on notice that they are being watched , even though police might not yet have enough evidence to convict them before a court of law .
only one person , mounir motassadeq , an associate of atta ’ s , has been formally arrested in germany in connection direct with the september 11th attacks .
he has been accused of supporting a terrorist group . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

when " trucker heinz " got dumped by his girlfriend , he turned to one of germany 's 21 autobahn churches for a little heavenly help . instead of pulling out a candy bar at rest stops , more and more german travelers are ditching vice in favor of god .
germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .
after buying a roll with rissole from the snack bar next door , you can enter into the sparsely decorated worship room of the chapel and browse the prayer book .
it includes entries from people like " trucker heinz , " who is praying for his girlfriend gabi to come back to him .
god 's own gps system germany 's 21 autobahn churches and chapels are a great place to take a little time out for reflection .
truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .
typically german ?
vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .
that may have been what brought trucker heinz to medenbach .
and maybe , just maybe , gabi 's returned to him by now . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .
" it ’ s perfect , " hoeneß says pointing to the chances for improving the soccer market in the future .

the last several weeks have seen a spate of arrests and detentions of suspected al qaeda operatives in europe .
this week four suspected members of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network were arrested in spain . the hunt for al qaeda operatives in europe met with some success this week , as european authorities in several countries continue their hunt for al qaeda terrorists , many of whom are believed to have used europe as a base of operations in the lead-up to the september 11 attacks in the u.s. spanish authorities this week arrested four men they suspect of being linked with the terror organization .
on tuesday , three men were taken into custody , two in madrid and one in the eastern city of castellon .
the men , all of syrian origin , are described as being members of a qaeda cell active in spain since 1994 .
police found videotapes belonging to one of the suspects that included footage of the world trade center , showing the twin towers from various angles and distances .
the tapes also showed san francisco ’ s golden gate bridge , the sears tower in chicago , new york ’ s empire state building and brooklyn bridge , as well as two california theme parks including disneyland .
the video footage included shots of bridge supports and , according to spain ’ s interior minister , were " obviously not what a tourist would make . "
the tapes , which were recorded five years ago , also show terrorist training exercises , such as attacks on tanks and the use of human shields .
spanish police said the images strongly suggest planning for the september 11 attacks dated back years and included scouting of other possible targets .
in the wake of the find , officials in san francisco doubled security at the golden gate bridge , one of the most famous landmarks in the u.s. , and a structure which carries more than 100,000 vehicles per day .
on wednesday , spanish police arrested a fourth suspect , identified as kamal hadid chaar , alias abu nour , who authorities suspect is involved with the organization ’ s financial activities .
" it wouldn ’ t surprise me if there are detentions in the near future of other individuals , connected to the previous ones , who are partners in some cases in economic operations , " police spokesman jose maria seara told reuters .
the four arrests this week are part of an operation started by spanish police last november , bringing the number total number of arrests of al qaeda suspects in spain to 24 .
italian forgers in milan , italian police arrested eight men on july 12 suspected of providing false identity papers for members of al qaeda , including some of the hijackers who carried out the september 11 attacks .
all but one were muslims from north africa .
one other suspect managed to escape the authorities .
massimo mazza , head of milan ’ s special operations investigation team , said the eight suspects provided the " vital underground cover needed by terrorist criminals , " and that the suspects had links with another group of document forgers .
u.s. officials believe that an islamic cultural center in milan served as al qaeda ’ s main european base .
muslim leaders have denied the accusation .
german radicals on july 3 , german police raided a several apartments and a bookstore in the city of hamburg , the northern port city in which suspected september 11 ringleader mohammed atta and at least two other conspirators lived quietly as sleepers and attended university in the years before the attacks .
seven suspected islamic radicals were detained in the sweeps , which authorities described as a pre-emptive strike against a group attempting to build a new terrorist cell there .
the men were aged 28 to 51 and included moroccans , egyptians , afghans and one german citizen .
they met regularly at the attawhid bookshop near the mosque in hamburg where atta prayed along with other members of the terrorist cell he led .
german authorities said the men had been heard saying they wanted " to give their lives for islam " although it is not clear whether the men belong to the al qaeda network .
one of men detained , abdelghani mzoudi , a 29-year-old citizen of the united arab emirates , was at one time atta ’ s former roommate in an apartment on marien street .
it is believed that the u.s. attacks may have been planned from this apartment in a quiet middle-class neighborhood .
the seven detained men were later released as police said there was not enough evidence that they were planning to commit terrorist acts , thereby repeating a pattern , criticized by the u.s. , where suspects are detained in raids and quickly freed .
but german officials defend the methods , saying such a strike is a way to rattle suspects and put them on notice that they are being watched , even though police might not yet have enough evidence to convict them before a court of law .
only one person , mounir motassadeq , an associate of atta ’ s , has been formally arrested in germany in connection direct with the september 11th attacks .
he has been accused of supporting a terrorist group . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the last several weeks have seen a spate of arrests and detentions of suspected al qaeda operatives in europe .
this week four suspected members of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network were arrested in spain . the hunt for al qaeda operatives in europe met with some success this week , as european authorities in several countries continue their hunt for al qaeda terrorists , many of whom are believed to have used europe as a base of operations in the lead-up to the september 11 attacks in the u.s. spanish authorities this week arrested four men they suspect of being linked with the terror organization .
on tuesday , three men were taken into custody , two in madrid and one in the eastern city of castellon .
the men , all of syrian origin , are described as being members of a qaeda cell active in spain since 1994 .
police found videotapes belonging to one of the suspects that included footage of the world trade center , showing the twin towers from various angles and distances .
the tapes also showed san francisco ’ s golden gate bridge , the sears tower in chicago , new york ’ s empire state building and brooklyn bridge , as well as two california theme parks including disneyland .
the video footage included shots of bridge supports and , according to spain ’ s interior minister , were " obviously not what a tourist would make . "
the tapes , which were recorded five years ago , also show terrorist training exercises , such as attacks on tanks and the use of human shields .
spanish police said the images strongly suggest planning for the september 11 attacks dated back years and included scouting of other possible targets .
in the wake of the find , officials in san francisco doubled security at the golden gate bridge , one of the most famous landmarks in the u.s. , and a structure which carries more than 100,000 vehicles per day .
on wednesday , spanish police arrested a fourth suspect , identified as kamal hadid chaar , alias abu nour , who authorities suspect is involved with the organization ’ s financial activities .
" it wouldn ’ t surprise me if there are detentions in the near future of other individuals , connected to the previous ones , who are partners in some cases in economic operations , " police spokesman jose maria seara told reuters .
the four arrests this week are part of an operation started by spanish police last november , bringing the number total number of arrests of al qaeda suspects in spain to 24 .
italian forgers in milan , italian police arrested eight men on july 12 suspected of providing false identity papers for members of al qaeda , including some of the hijackers who carried out the september 11 attacks .
all but one were muslims from north africa .
one other suspect managed to escape the authorities .
massimo mazza , head of milan ’ s special operations investigation team , said the eight suspects provided the " vital underground cover needed by terrorist criminals , " and that the suspects had links with another group of document forgers .
u.s. officials believe that an islamic cultural center in milan served as al qaeda ’ s main european base .
muslim leaders have denied the accusation .
german radicals on july 3 , german police raided a several apartments and a bookstore in the city of hamburg , the northern port city in which suspected september 11 ringleader mohammed atta and at least two other conspirators lived quietly as sleepers and attended university in the years before the attacks .
seven suspected islamic radicals were detained in the sweeps , which authorities described as a pre-emptive strike against a group attempting to build a new terrorist cell there .
the men were aged 28 to 51 and included moroccans , egyptians , afghans and one german citizen .
they met regularly at the attawhid bookshop near the mosque in hamburg where atta prayed along with other members of the terrorist cell he led .
german authorities said the men had been heard saying they wanted " to give their lives for islam " although it is not clear whether the men belong to the al qaeda network .
one of men detained , abdelghani mzoudi , a 29-year-old citizen of the united arab emirates , was at one time atta ’ s former roommate in an apartment on marien street .
it is believed that the u.s. attacks may have been planned from this apartment in a quiet middle-class neighborhood .
the seven detained men were later released as police said there was not enough evidence that they were planning to commit terrorist acts , thereby repeating a pattern , criticized by the u.s. , where suspects are detained in raids and quickly freed .
but german officials defend the methods , saying such a strike is a way to rattle suspects and put them on notice that they are being watched , even though police might not yet have enough evidence to convict them before a court of law .
only one person , mounir motassadeq , an associate of atta ’ s , has been formally arrested in germany in connection direct with the september 11th attacks .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .
" it ’ s perfect , " hoeneß says pointing to the chances for improving the soccer market in the future .
" finally , reason and caution have entered the picture . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

this week four suspected members of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network were arrested in spain . the hunt for al qaeda operatives in europe met with some success this week , as european authorities in several countries continue their hunt for al qaeda terrorists , many of whom are believed to have used europe as a base of operations in the lead-up to the september 11 attacks in the u.s. spanish authorities this week arrested four men they suspect of being linked with the terror organization .
on tuesday , three men were taken into custody , two in madrid and one in the eastern city of castellon .
the men , all of syrian origin , are described as being members of a qaeda cell active in spain since 1994 .
police found videotapes belonging to one of the suspects that included footage of the world trade center , showing the twin towers from various angles and distances .
the tapes also showed san francisco ’ s golden gate bridge , the sears tower in chicago , new york ’ s empire state building and brooklyn bridge , as well as two california theme parks including disneyland .
the video footage included shots of bridge supports and , according to spain ’ s interior minister , were " obviously not what a tourist would make . "
the tapes , which were recorded five years ago , also show terrorist training exercises , such as attacks on tanks and the use of human shields .
spanish police said the images strongly suggest planning for the september 11 attacks dated back years and included scouting of other possible targets .
in the wake of the find , officials in san francisco doubled security at the golden gate bridge , one of the most famous landmarks in the u.s. , and a structure which carries more than 100,000 vehicles per day .
on wednesday , spanish police arrested a fourth suspect , identified as kamal hadid chaar , alias abu nour , who authorities suspect is involved with the organization ’ s financial activities .
" it wouldn ’ t surprise me if there are detentions in the near future of other individuals , connected to the previous ones , who are partners in some cases in economic operations , " police spokesman jose maria seara told reuters .
the four arrests this week are part of an operation started by spanish police last november , bringing the number total number of arrests of al qaeda suspects in spain to 24 .
italian forgers in milan , italian police arrested eight men on july 12 suspected of providing false identity papers for members of al qaeda , including some of the hijackers who carried out the september 11 attacks .
all but one were muslims from north africa .
one other suspect managed to escape the authorities .
massimo mazza , head of milan ’ s special operations investigation team , said the eight suspects provided the " vital underground cover needed by terrorist criminals , " and that the suspects had links with another group of document forgers .
u.s. officials believe that an islamic cultural center in milan served as al qaeda ’ s main european base .
muslim leaders have denied the accusation .
german radicals on july 3 , german police raided a several apartments and a bookstore in the city of hamburg , the northern port city in which suspected september 11 ringleader mohammed atta and at least two other conspirators lived quietly as sleepers and attended university in the years before the attacks .

the men were aged 28 to 51 and included moroccans , egyptians , afghans and one german citizen .
they met regularly at the attawhid bookshop near the mosque in hamburg where atta prayed along with other members of the terrorist cell he led .

one of men detained , abdelghani mzoudi , a 29-year-old citizen of the united arab emirates , was at one time atta ’ s former roommate in an apartment on marien street .
it is believed that the u.s. attacks may have been planned from this apartment in a quiet middle-class neighborhood .
the seven detained men were later released as police said there was not enough evidence that they were planning to commit terrorist acts , thereby repeating a pattern , criticized by the u.s. , where suspects are detained in raids and quickly freed .

the last several weeks have seen a spate of arrests and detentions of suspected al qaeda operatives in europe .
this week four suspected members of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network were arrested in spain . the hunt for al qaeda operatives in europe met with some success this week , as european authorities in several countries continue their hunt for al qaeda terrorists , many of whom are believed to have used europe as a base of operations in the lead-up to the september 11 attacks in the u.s. spanish authorities this week arrested four men they suspect of being linked with the terror organization .
on tuesday , three men were taken into custody , two in madrid and one in the eastern city of castellon .
the men , all of syrian origin , are described as being members of a qaeda cell active in spain since 1994 .
police found videotapes belonging to one of the suspects that included footage of the world trade center , showing the twin towers from various angles and distances .
the tapes also showed san francisco ’ s golden gate bridge , the sears tower in chicago , new york ’ s empire state building and brooklyn bridge , as well as two california theme parks including disneyland .
the video footage included shots of bridge supports and , according to spain ’ s interior minister , were " obviously not what a tourist would make . "
the tapes , which were recorded five years ago , also show terrorist training exercises , such as attacks on tanks and the use of human shields .
spanish police said the images strongly suggest planning for the september 11 attacks dated back years and included scouting of other possible targets .
in the wake of the find , officials in san francisco doubled security at the golden gate bridge , one of the most famous landmarks in the u.s. , and a structure which carries more than 100,000 vehicles per day .
on wednesday , spanish police arrested a fourth suspect , identified as kamal hadid chaar , alias abu nour , who authorities suspect is involved with the organization ’ s financial activities .
" it wouldn ’ t surprise me if there are detentions in the near future of other individuals , connected to the previous ones , who are partners in some cases in economic operations , " police spokesman jose maria seara told reuters .
the four arrests this week are part of an operation started by spanish police last november , bringing the number total number of arrests of al qaeda suspects in spain to 24 .
italian forgers in milan , italian police arrested eight men on july 12 suspected of providing false identity papers for members of al qaeda , including some of the hijackers who carried out the september 11 attacks .
all but one were muslims from north africa .
one other suspect managed to escape the authorities .
massimo mazza , head of milan ’ s special operations investigation team , said the eight suspects provided the " vital underground cover needed by terrorist criminals , " and that the suspects had links with another group of document forgers .
u.s. officials believe that an islamic cultural center in milan served as al qaeda ’ s main european base .
muslim leaders have denied the accusation .
german radicals on july 3 , german police raided a several apartments and a bookstore in the city of hamburg , the northern port city in which suspected september 11 ringleader mohammed atta and at least two other conspirators lived quietly as sleepers and attended university in the years before the attacks .
seven suspected islamic radicals were detained in the sweeps , which authorities described as a pre-emptive strike against a group attempting to build a new terrorist cell there .
the men were aged 28 to 51 and included moroccans , egyptians , afghans and one german citizen .
they met regularly at the attawhid bookshop near the mosque in hamburg where atta prayed along with other members of the terrorist cell he led .
german authorities said the men had been heard saying they wanted " to give their lives for islam " although it is not clear whether the men belong to the al qaeda network .
one of men detained , abdelghani mzoudi , a 29-year-old citizen of the united arab emirates , was at one time atta ’ s former roommate in an apartment on marien street .
it is believed that the u.s. attacks may have been planned from this apartment in a quiet middle-class neighborhood .
the seven detained men were later released as police said there was not enough evidence that they were planning to commit terrorist acts , thereby repeating a pattern , criticized by the u.s. , where suspects are detained in raids and quickly freed .
but german officials defend the methods , saying such a strike is a way to rattle suspects and put them on notice that they are being watched , even though police might not yet have enough evidence to convict them before a court of law .
only one person , mounir motassadeq , an associate of atta ’ s , has been formally arrested in germany in connection direct with the september 11th attacks .
he has been accused of supporting a terrorist group . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .

god 's own gps system germany 's 21 autobahn churches and chapels are a great place to take a little time out for reflection .
truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .

vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .

the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .
after buying a roll with rissole from the snack bar next door , you can enter into the sparsely decorated worship room of the chapel and browse the prayer book .
it includes entries from people like " trucker heinz , " who is praying for his girlfriend gabi to come back to him .
god 's own gps system germany 's 21 autobahn churches and chapels are a great place to take a little time out for reflection .
truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .
typically german ?
vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .
that may have been what brought trucker heinz to medenbach .
and maybe , just maybe , gabi 's returned to him by now . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the last several weeks have seen a spate of arrests and detentions of suspected al qaeda operatives in europe .
this week four suspected members of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network were arrested in spain . the hunt for al qaeda operatives in europe met with some success this week , as european authorities in several countries continue their hunt for al qaeda terrorists , many of whom are believed to have used europe as a base of operations in the lead-up to the september 11 attacks in the u.s. spanish authorities this week arrested four men they suspect of being linked with the terror organization .
on tuesday , three men were taken into custody , two in madrid and one in the eastern city of castellon .
the men , all of syrian origin , are described as being members of a qaeda cell active in spain since 1994 .
police found videotapes belonging to one of the suspects that included footage of the world trade center , showing the twin towers from various angles and distances .
the tapes also showed san francisco ’ s golden gate bridge , the sears tower in chicago , new york ’ s empire state building and brooklyn bridge , as well as two california theme parks including disneyland .
the video footage included shots of bridge supports and , according to spain ’ s interior minister , were " obviously not what a tourist would make . "
the tapes , which were recorded five years ago , also show terrorist training exercises , such as attacks on tanks and the use of human shields .
spanish police said the images strongly suggest planning for the september 11 attacks dated back years and included scouting of other possible targets .
in the wake of the find , officials in san francisco doubled security at the golden gate bridge , one of the most famous landmarks in the u.s. , and a structure which carries more than 100,000 vehicles per day .
on wednesday , spanish police arrested a fourth suspect , identified as kamal hadid chaar , alias abu nour , who authorities suspect is involved with the organization ’ s financial activities .
" it wouldn ’ t surprise me if there are detentions in the near future of other individuals , connected to the previous ones , who are partners in some cases in economic operations , " police spokesman jose maria seara told reuters .
the four arrests this week are part of an operation started by spanish police last november , bringing the number total number of arrests of al qaeda suspects in spain to 24 .
italian forgers in milan , italian police arrested eight men on july 12 suspected of providing false identity papers for members of al qaeda , including some of the hijackers who carried out the september 11 attacks .
all but one were muslims from north africa .
one other suspect managed to escape the authorities .
massimo mazza , head of milan ’ s special operations investigation team , said the eight suspects provided the " vital underground cover needed by terrorist criminals , " and that the suspects had links with another group of document forgers .
u.s. officials believe that an islamic cultural center in milan served as al qaeda ’ s main european base .
muslim leaders have denied the accusation .
german radicals on july 3 , german police raided a several apartments and a bookstore in the city of hamburg , the northern port city in which suspected september 11 ringleader mohammed atta and at least two other conspirators lived quietly as sleepers and attended university in the years before the attacks .
seven suspected islamic radicals were detained in the sweeps , which authorities described as a pre-emptive strike against a group attempting to build a new terrorist cell there .
the men were aged 28 to 51 and included moroccans , egyptians , afghans and one german citizen .
they met regularly at the attawhid bookshop near the mosque in hamburg where atta prayed along with other members of the terrorist cell he led .
german authorities said the men had been heard saying they wanted " to give their lives for islam " although it is not clear whether the men belong to the al qaeda network .
one of men detained , abdelghani mzoudi , a 29-year-old citizen of the united arab emirates , was at one time atta ’ s former roommate in an apartment on marien street .
it is believed that the u.s. attacks may have been planned from this apartment in a quiet middle-class neighborhood .
the seven detained men were later released as police said there was not enough evidence that they were planning to commit terrorist acts , thereby repeating a pattern , criticized by the u.s. , where suspects are detained in raids and quickly freed .

on wednesday , spanish police arrested a fourth suspect , identified as kamal hadid chaar , alias abu nour , who authorities suspect is involved with the organization ’ s financial activities .

this week four suspected members of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network were arrested in spain . the hunt for al qaeda operatives in europe met with some success this week , as european authorities in several countries continue their hunt for al qaeda terrorists , many of whom are believed to have used europe as a base of operations in the lead-up to the september 11 attacks in the u.s. spanish authorities this week arrested four men they suspect of being linked with the terror organization .
on tuesday , three men were taken into custody , two in madrid and one in the eastern city of castellon .
the men , all of syrian origin , are described as being members of a qaeda cell active in spain since 1994 .
police found videotapes belonging to one of the suspects that included footage of the world trade center , showing the twin towers from various angles and distances .
the tapes also showed san francisco ’ s golden gate bridge , the sears tower in chicago , new york ’ s empire state building and brooklyn bridge , as well as two california theme parks including disneyland .
the video footage included shots of bridge supports and , according to spain ’ s interior minister , were " obviously not what a tourist would make . "

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .

the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .

the last several weeks have seen a spate of arrests and detentions of suspected al qaeda operatives in europe .
this week four suspected members of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network were arrested in spain . the hunt for al qaeda operatives in europe met with some success this week , as european authorities in several countries continue their hunt for al qaeda terrorists , many of whom are believed to have used europe as a base of operations in the lead-up to the september 11 attacks in the u.s. spanish authorities this week arrested four men they suspect of being linked with the terror organization .
on tuesday , three men were taken into custody , two in madrid and one in the eastern city of castellon .
the men , all of syrian origin , are described as being members of a qaeda cell active in spain since 1994 .
police found videotapes belonging to one of the suspects that included footage of the world trade center , showing the twin towers from various angles and distances .
the tapes also showed san francisco ’ s golden gate bridge , the sears tower in chicago , new york ’ s empire state building and brooklyn bridge , as well as two california theme parks including disneyland .
the video footage included shots of bridge supports and , according to spain ’ s interior minister , were " obviously not what a tourist would make . "
the tapes , which were recorded five years ago , also show terrorist training exercises , such as attacks on tanks and the use of human shields .
spanish police said the images strongly suggest planning for the september 11 attacks dated back years and included scouting of other possible targets .
in the wake of the find , officials in san francisco doubled security at the golden gate bridge , one of the most famous landmarks in the u.s. , and a structure which carries more than 100,000 vehicles per day .
on wednesday , spanish police arrested a fourth suspect , identified as kamal hadid chaar , alias abu nour , who authorities suspect is involved with the organization ’ s financial activities .
" it wouldn ’ t surprise me if there are detentions in the near future of other individuals , connected to the previous ones , who are partners in some cases in economic operations , " police spokesman jose maria seara told reuters .
the four arrests this week are part of an operation started by spanish police last november , bringing the number total number of arrests of al qaeda suspects in spain to 24 .
italian forgers in milan , italian police arrested eight men on july 12 suspected of providing false identity papers for members of al qaeda , including some of the hijackers who carried out the september 11 attacks .
all but one were muslims from north africa .
one other suspect managed to escape the authorities .
massimo mazza , head of milan ’ s special operations investigation team , said the eight suspects provided the " vital underground cover needed by terrorist criminals , " and that the suspects had links with another group of document forgers .
u.s. officials believe that an islamic cultural center in milan served as al qaeda ’ s main european base .
muslim leaders have denied the accusation .
german radicals on july 3 , german police raided a several apartments and a bookstore in the city of hamburg , the northern port city in which suspected september 11 ringleader mohammed atta and at least two other conspirators lived quietly as sleepers and attended university in the years before the attacks .
seven suspected islamic radicals were detained in the sweeps , which authorities described as a pre-emptive strike against a group attempting to build a new terrorist cell there .
the men were aged 28 to 51 and included moroccans , egyptians , afghans and one german citizen .
they met regularly at the attawhid bookshop near the mosque in hamburg where atta prayed along with other members of the terrorist cell he led .
german authorities said the men had been heard saying they wanted " to give their lives for islam " although it is not clear whether the men belong to the al qaeda network .
one of men detained , abdelghani mzoudi , a 29-year-old citizen of the united arab emirates , was at one time atta ’ s former roommate in an apartment on marien street .
it is believed that the u.s. attacks may have been planned from this apartment in a quiet middle-class neighborhood .
the seven detained men were later released as police said there was not enough evidence that they were planning to commit terrorist acts , thereby repeating a pattern , criticized by the u.s. , where suspects are detained in raids and quickly freed .
but german officials defend the methods , saying such a strike is a way to rattle suspects and put them on notice that they are being watched , even though police might not yet have enough evidence to convict them before a court of law .
only one person , mounir motassadeq , an associate of atta ’ s , has been formally arrested in germany in connection direct with the september 11th attacks .

spanish police said the images strongly suggest planning for the september 11 attacks dated back years and included scouting of other possible targets .

when " trucker heinz " got dumped by his girlfriend , he turned to one of germany 's 21 autobahn churches for a little heavenly help . instead of pulling out a candy bar at rest stops , more and more german travelers are ditching vice in favor of god .
germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .
after buying a roll with rissole from the snack bar next door , you can enter into the sparsely decorated worship room of the chapel and browse the prayer book .
it includes entries from people like " trucker heinz , " who is praying for his girlfriend gabi to come back to him .
god 's own gps system germany 's 21 autobahn churches and chapels are a great place to take a little time out for reflection .
truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .
typically german ?
vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .
that may have been what brought trucker heinz to medenbach .
and maybe , just maybe , gabi 's returned to him by now . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live im focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .

when " trucker heinz " got dumped by his girlfriend , he turned to one of germany 's 21 autobahn churches for a little heavenly help . instead of pulling out a candy bar at rest stops , more and more german travelers are ditching vice in favor of god .
germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .
after buying a roll with rissole from the snack bar next door , you can enter into the sparsely decorated worship room of the chapel and browse the prayer book .
it includes entries from people like " trucker heinz , " who is praying for his girlfriend gabi to come back to him .
god 's own gps system germany 's 21 autobahn churches and chapels are a great place to take a little time out for reflection .
truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .
as a part of that trend , a number of run-down village churches have been renovated and converted into autobahn churches .
typically german ?
vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "
one year later , the first protestant autobahn church opened in exeter on the a2 .
the tradition has been continued by communities and regional organizations .
roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .
catholic golden girls in his 219 page thesis , gereon vogler took an empirical look at autobahn church and chapel visitors .
according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .
that may have been what brought trucker heinz to medenbach .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .
" it ’ s perfect , " hoeneß says pointing to the chances for improving the soccer market in the future .

germany 's habit of conducting roadside religious rituals is unique in europe .
the first thing you see when you exit the autobahn at the rest stop in medenbach , just down the a3 from wiesbaden , is the glass ceiling and bare cement wall of the first autobahn church in the state of hesse .

truckers , tourists and commuters visit them regularly to pray for help or even just a safe trip home .
between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit autobahn houses of worship in germany each year , estimates theologian gereon vogler , who runs the internet site www.autobahnkirchen.de.
the site provides a virtual overview of these houses of god – from the ecumenical autobahn chapel at the roadside cafe dammer berge on the a1 to the catholic autobahn church : " maria by the wayside . "
between 1985 and 2002 , 17 churches opened their doors on german autobahns – signaling the emergence of a new trend combining two popular german pastimes : fahrvergnügen and church .
they range in size and scope from chapels hidden behind gas stations to historic community churches located just a few kilometers from the autobahn exit .
" since reunification , more and more communities in eastern germany are combining business with pleasure , " says vogler .

vogler believes the popularity of autobahn churches is a unique product of the german psyché .
he says he knows of only a few such churches in france and italy .
yet despite germany 's clear leadership in connecting drivers with god on the autobahn , neither the catholic nor the protestant church here has appointed any officials to oversee the roadside churches and create new ones .
the whole phenomenon began in earnest back in 1958 following a private initiative undertaken after a major traffic accident .
the family of an augsburg paper factory was involved in an accident on the a8 between munich and stuttgart , and the family then donated a piece of land and the building that later became the first catholic autobahn church : " maria , protector of travelers . "

roadside churches have become such a phenomenon that students have even written their university theses on the subject .

according to his findings , the classic autobahn church visitor tends to be catholic , female and middle-aged .
numerous commuters also seek deeper religious meaning in the chapels .
" instead of institutionalized religious services , many people are looking for silent prayer , " vogler says .
many who would rather sleep in on sundays rather than go to mass , often find themselves feeling suddenly alone and helpless on the autobahn – and for them , a roadside church can often bring comfort .

but teams are struggling to stay afloat financially , and managers are slashing superstar salaries . with just a few weeks before the start of the new soccer season , soccer clubs in europe are finding themselves in a difficult position .
their teams and sport are as popular as ever , but the money available for hiring new players is considerably less than in previous years .
spain ’ s traditionally-favored club and current champions league winner real madrid , for instance , was forced to freeze its entire budget for new players this year .
according to the team ’ s general manager , jorge valdano , real madrid is going through the same thing every other spanish team is experiencing .
all soccer clubs in spain are facing the biggest financial crisis in decades , he says .
forced time-out for soccer clubs all of europe , including germany , is going through tough times soccer-wise .
big teams are going through budget-cuts , and slashing new players ’ salaries .
smaller teams are declaring bankruptcy and closing their clubs altogether .
the german bundesliga is under such tight budgetary restraints that only 100 million euro -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- is available for new players in the upcoming season .
that ’ s a quarter less than in the previous years .
the main reason for the strapped budget in german clubs is a 20 percent reduction in income from televised games .
until declaring bankruptcy in april , the media giant leo kirch paid 375 million euro -lrb- $ 375 million -rrb- per season to the deutsche fussball-liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- , the umbrella organization for germany ’ s soccer clubs , for broadcasting their games .
the dfl in turn distributed the money among the 36 professional clubs in the first and second leagues .
each club in the first league received an average of 15 million euro -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- per season for the air time .
each team in the second league received four million euro .
since the kirch media conglomerate went bankrupt , germany ’ s soccer teams have felt their cash flow dry up .
time is money on air sales for television broadcasts of games account for between 9 and 40 percent of soccer clubs ’ budgets in germany .
from year to year , teams depend on this near certain source of income to pay for players salaries .
compared to other countries , such as italy , german teams ’ dependence on air time is relatively low .
italy ’ s first league teams -lrb- series a -rrb- receive approximately 60 percent of their annual budget from broadcast sales .
but this year two pay-per-view stations , stream and telepiù , have been unable to pay teams for broadcast rights .
as a result , eight italian soccer clubs will be starting the season without a contract with broadcasters .
they ’ ll be forced to make drastic cuts in spending .
bookkeeping like on the new market the loss of such a large portion of their annual budget has led europe ’ s soccer teams to rethink the way they balance their books .
uli hoeness , manager of fc-bayern in munich , describes the hard times in europe ’ s soccer clubs as something that was to be expected .
" finally there ’ s a reason for what has been sneaking up all these years : soccer clubs are spending beyond their limit , " he explains .
the bundesliga is overrated like the new market , hoeness says .
the constant buying and selling of players over the last few years resembles trading on the stock market and the dealing in options .
in reality , new players with salaries in the two-figure millions often do very little for their team other than make headlines when they switch teams .
they spend most of their time warming the bench or when they enter the field , it ’ s for a short cameo appearance in the last minutes , hoeneß says .
record transfers like that of the french player zinedine zidane from the italian club juventus turin to real madrid for 76.7 million euro -lrb- $ 77.5 million -rrb- will no longer be possible in the future .
with the purchase of zidane in 2001 , real madrid pushed its players ’ fees to over 400 million euro .
only the sale of the team ’ s private training field could pull the 100-year old madrid out of the red .
in italy a similar discrepancy between earnings and spendings was visible even before the television crisis hit home .
in 2002 , the teams in the serie a had paid salaries totaling 868 million euro .
less than half of that money was covered by the teams ’ regular income .
they were spending far beyond their limit .
throughout the european soccer scene , the trade in players has been mainly about speculation , and now the bubble has burst .
many teams got burned buying new players , and this year they ’ re forced to take a good hard look at the bottom line .
" it ’ s perfect , " hoeneß says pointing to the chances for improving the soccer market in the future .
" finally , reason and caution have entered the picture . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

that 's the thinking behind a conference on saturday involving some of labour 's most forthright left-wing mps .
this week saw the first national strike by council workers since the 1979 winter of discontent .
so , are the organisers of this socialist conference sensing a real sea change in britain ?

" we have to lend them a car , otherwise they 'll take the body out in a wheelbarrow .. a wheelbarrow , " she blurted out , shaking slightly .
there was an edge of desperation in her voice .
there is simply no food in some areas of angola a man stood before us ; it was his wife who had died .
he was moaning , and weaving from side to side , swaying his upper body and his head in a rocking motion .
she was 25 .
and her body was stretched just metres from us , covered with a cloth .
no food at all we went next to a little clinic , the only one for miles - and in it were the starving and emaciated .
there were children who had been borne on their mothers ' backs for miles to get here .
the mothers too were thin , unwell , unfed .
they had come from areas of angola where there simply is no food .
abscesses , pneumonia , measles , meningitis ... they are all there in the starvation camps of angola no food .
it is hard to imagine .
how can there be no food at all ?
i kept trying to imagine what it would be like to wake up in the morning , and know that all that day , there would be nothing .
you would pass through the early morning alright i suppose , but by mid-afternoon it would be different . : southern africa famine in pictures : southern africa famine then you would go to bed on an empty stomach and wake up the next day and do the same .
and so for weeks or longer .
camps of hell angolans have been eating wild leaves , rats whatever they can get .
but it has not really helped .
they are weak and exhausted .
there are two forms of starvation .
infection and disease prey on the malnourished one is kwashiorkor , where the belly swells and - in the cruellest irony makes you look fat .
the swelling can be very painful .
fluid builds up in the limbs too .
sometimes the pressure is too much , and the skin cracks and forms lesions .
even more distressing to see is mirasmus .
here the body wastes away until the skin hangs off the bone , and the very shape of the person 's skeleton becomes apparent .
in both cases infection and disease start to feed on the weakness .
abscesses , pneumonia , measles , meningitis ... they are all there in the starvation camps of angola .
and they are camps of hell - places that should not exist except in our nightmares .
if there was one such camp in europe we would end it , erase it , change it - make it go away , and quickly .
desolation but it is in africa , so the camps are there .
and they will be for a while .
the worst camp we visited was in a town called mavinga , in an extremely remote part of angola .
perhaps her parents died on the way here , perhaps she had seen terrible fighting , perhaps she was raped , perhaps all three , who knows ?
to get there you fly for hours over stunningly beautiful country - there is something about visiting places man has destroyed that makes the natural beauty stand out .
this is a country of immense swathes of dry bush - of waterfalls , jungles , mountains , and a glistening coastline .
angola has a small population and is given to gigantic plentiful harvests .
there would be such harvests this year , except for the war .
mavinga , like most of the country , has been almost totally inaccessible to the outside world for three decades because of the war .
it was not always so , but nowadays mavinga has nothing but one road , a short battered dirt airstrip , and a clinic .
the rest is desolation .
antonia some food is being flown in - not enough for the adults , but for the children .
some people had walked miles in the hope of food so people had flocked to mavinga in their thousands from far away , and were camped out on the ground , with nothing but the rags they walked here in , and sometimes a pot or blanket .
the whole area near the clinic was smoky , and crowded .
it smelt of cooking fires and of infection and disease .
through this a little girl walked by , her hand held by an aid worker .
she walked strangely , awkwardly - her legs protruding from her dirty skirt like sticks .
her teeth were big .
she kept looking up and around in total confusion .
this was antonia .
traumatised antonia was found nearby wandering in the bush alone .
no parents , no guardian , just alone .
she was half the weight she should be and would have starved to death had she not ended up here .
her body may recover - but what a torture to live no one knew how old she was - but they guessed she was 12 .
she sat down and stared at her feet , moving her head from side to side a little .
if you watched closely you could see the character of whoever she was before coming through , but it was hard .
whatever she had seen - or whatever had happened to her had traumatised her , damaged her mind probably permanently .
perhaps her parents died on the way here , perhaps she had seen terrible fighting , perhaps she was raped , perhaps all three , who knows ?
alone she could speak a little portuguese , the language of the former colonists , so she had been educated i suppose - amazing in a remote place like this .
only a few words came out , and very quietly after coaxing .
clinics may help the body , but few will get psychiatric help this is how we know her name .
an old man in the camp had once or twice taken it upon himself to attend to her , but he was nowhere to be seen for the many hours we were there .
he was probably fighting his own battles - his own illness - lying on the ground somewhere .
so all day and night , she was basically alone .
she is getting food from the aid workers , but no one puts her to bed at night .
no grown up tells her it is all going to be alright .
and it is n't .
it is not going to be alright .
what will become of her ?
she will never get psychiatric help in a place like mavinga .
her body may recover , but what a torture to live .
i wish her well .

supporters of shoppers in europe say that if the uk joined the single european currency , consumers would realise they are paying up to 15 % more than people on the continent .
the group 's official launch takes place on monday but campaigners will take to the streets on saturday with leaflets and posters .
supporters of the group will be setting up stalls in edinburgh , dunfermline , cumbernauld , perth , loanhead and glenrothes .
campaign organiser barbara macleod said she hoped the day of action would encourage more people to support their protest .
she said : " shoppers in europe consists of ordinary shoppers who feel they are being ripped off and think it is awful that we have to pay much higher prices for the same goods .
" there are loads of reasons why prices are higher , but we feel that if there was the same amount of price transparency in britain as there is in the eurozone , prices here would have to come down because people would realise they are paying so much more . "
the group is not affiliated to any political party , although several pro-euro politicians have joined .
the group said that goods such as cigarettes , alcohol , cars , clothing and cds are also over-priced in the uk .
the organisation has vowed to " name and shame " retailers who charge too much in a bid to highlight the issue .
chancellor gordon brown has said that a referendum on whether britain should join the euro will only be held once five economic tests are met .

the labour party has to represent the country not just those people who voted for us , " he said . "
the labour party is what people voted for " tony benn , former labour mp the conference also coincides with a strike by workers at manchester airport .
members of the transport and general workers ' union plan to stage a two-hour strike on saturday in a long-running row over jobs .
mick rix , general secretary of the train driver 's union , told bbc radio 5 live that many people felt discontented and disillusioned with a labour government that they had such high hopes for .
" people want the government to change course and taking a more caring and humanitarian course than it is at the moment , " he said .
former labour mp tony benn , london mayor ken livingstone , mps diane abbott and dennis skinner as well as the newly-elected leader of the uk 's second largest union amicus derek simpson will be among those attending saturday 's conference .
mr benn told the bbc : " new labour is the smallest political party there 's ever been in the history of british politics , but as they 're all in the cabinet , they 're quite powerful .
" the labour party is what people voted for . "
the election this week of mr simpson over staunch new labour supporter sir ken jackson was seen as the latest setback for the government in its increasingly strained relations with the unions .
and a showdown at the conference over the government 's use of private money in the public sector has been widely predicted .
