thousands of people gathered monday in lower manhattan to see the lights , six months after the attacks the toppled the towers and have left some 2,800 people still missing .
courageous comeback mr nihan has lived all of his life in manhattan , and he was deeply affected by the attacks .
for many , it is still too early to think about a permanent replacement for the world trade center he saw the flames as the second plane hit the south tower .
" it was the worst thing that has happened in my life .

it was three weeks before they were married , and dave often called beth in the mornings so she was n't surprised to when he rang .
the lights are supposed to be visible for a mile up in the night sky " i did n't think it was anything but an ' i love you ' call , " she said .
instead , he told her to turn on the news , as he watched debris fall from the world trade centre towers .
after that phone call , he could n't reach her for almost three hours , and she did n't know if he had been safely evacuated .

the british prime minister 's warning about the threat posed by iraq was backed by us vice-president dick cheney as the pair met in downing street . "
there is a threat from saddam hussein and the weapons of mass destruction that he has acquired " tony blair their post-talks media conference came six months to the hour after the us terror attacks .
a possible second phase of the war against terrorism was on the agenda at the meeting , which comes before mr cheney embarks on a 10-day tour of the middle-east .
mr blair said : " there is a threat from saddam hussein and the weapons of mass destruction that he has acquired .
it is not in doubt at all . "
mr blair said the coalition partners now needed to " reflect and deliberate " on how that problem should be addressed .
10-day mission mr cheney and mr blair discussed the progress of the coalition formed in the wake of the us terror atrocities , as well as other issues such as us tariffs on steel imports .
downing street has said it has no evidence that iraq was involved in the 11 september attacks .
but the uk prime minister , who underlined the importance of restarting the middle east peace process , stressed the progress that had been made in afghanistan against the taleban and al-qaeda network .
mr cheney said it was important to prevent the " potential marriage " between that network and states which had nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .
mr blair faces growing domestic disquiet over military action against iraq - many labour mps are among the 70 who have signed a motion opposing action .
labour mp alice mahon said mr blair should stop being the " little lapdog of america " and should steer away from a course that could start a third world war .
there is unease elsewhere in europe about such action .
richard pearle , defence adviser to us president bush , said he was disappointed that a number of america 's friends in europe were " nowhere to be seen " when us security was under threat .

the reaction came on the day that home secretary david blunkett launched an initiative to increase the number of stop and searches carried out - but with police officers obliged to tell people why they were being targeted .
stop and search in england and wales about 4m stops a year 853,188 searches a year black people five times more likely to be stopped than white people its use plummeted after lawrence inquiry mr smyth said stop and search had been tried before and did not work .
" it was very corrosive to police / public relations .
it caused more conflict than any other single policing operation , " he told bbc news .
but mr blunkett believes the new guidelines will give officers the confidence they have government backing .
" there has been quite a dramatic drop -lsb- in the number of stop and searches -rsb- over the last two years , " said the home secretary .
" ironically , the proportion of that small number who are black or asian has risen . "

officers currently record details when they stop and search someone but these are not passed onto the person searched .
if a person is stopped without being searched , details may not be recorded at all .
under the new guidelines , police would issue what the home office calls a " simple " form , explaining the reasons for the stop .
a spokeswoman said the form would " demonstrate that it is a useful power that 's not being used in a discriminatory way , which has been the complaint in the past " .
mr blunkett hopes police will start using stop and search - which he described as a " crucial tool " - more to target potential suspects in certain key areas .
' racial bias ' he told the house of commons : " we are revising the police and criminal evidence code on stop and search to ensure that we protect those members of the community who are most vulnerable from those who are most violent . "

lib dem home affairs spokesman simon hughes said : " provided questioning -lsb- of suspects -rsb- is based on reasonable suspicion , the policy should be supported . "
