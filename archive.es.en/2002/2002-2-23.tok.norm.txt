the landmark agreement signed on friday by prime minister ranil wickramasinghe and the separatists paves the way for direct peace talks .
the face-to-face talks would be the first in seven years aimed at ending a conflict that has killed 64,000 people and divided the island nation .
the united states has welcomed the norwegian government 's continued attempts to broker a negotiated settlement .
mr wickramasinghe said he would not disclose the full details of the agreement until sunday , but said it represented the " first step towards peace " .
muted public reaction the truce sets out a series of confidence-building measures to be implemented over a period of 90 days and will give government troops and rebels access to each other 's areas while travelling unarmed and out of uniform .
public reaction to the deal has been muted as people wait to see what happens after the ceasefire takes effect at midnight local time -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- on saturday .
in 1995 sri lankans saw a similar ceasefire fail after 100 days with an attack on the sri lankan navy .
but that truce was not monitored by a third party and the bbc 's frances harrison says that the fact that both sides have now signed up to an internationally-brokered deal should ensure that they stick to it .
this deal allows for the truce to be monitored by norway , finland and sweden .
by monday , they are expected to form the monitoring mission , which will also include rebels and government representatives .
historic visit on friday mr wickramasinghe visited a checkpoint leading to the rebel-controlled north of the country to formally hand over his signed copy of the agreement to the norwegian ambassador .
it was the first visit there by a sri lankan prime minister in more than 10 years and security was tight .
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam -lrb- ltte -rrb- have been fighting for a separate homeland in tamil majority areas in the north and east of the country .
at the root of the conflict is the discrimination the country 's minority tamils say they have suffered at the hands of the sinhalese majority .

mr gusmao , a former guerrilla , has earned the support of most of the territory 's political parties .
" i continue to believe that i am not the ideal person for this job , but i will do the best job that i can , " he said at a news conference in the capital , dili .
his only opponent in the election will be francisco xavier do amaral , who served as president for nine days between the withdrawal of former colonial power portugal in 1975 and the invasion by indonesian forces .
correspondents say the presidential role is likely to be ceremonial , as the country 's constitution calls for a parliamentary style of government .
guerrilla hero the bbc 's richard galpin in jakarta says mr gusmao has always been a reluctant politician , with even the decision to file for presidency being left to just before the deadline .
popular and charismatic , he is considered a hero in east timor after he commanded the guerrilla army falantil against indonesia during their occupation of east timor .
in 1992 he was captured in dili and jailed for life by the indonesian authorities , before being freed in 1999 eight days after east timor voted for independence .

mr gusmao , a former guerrilla , has earned the support of most of the territory 's political parties .
" i continue to believe that i am not the ideal person for this job , but i will do the best job that i can , " he said at a news conference in the capital , dili .
his only opponent in the election will be francisco xavier do amaral , who served as president for nine days between the withdrawal of former colonial power portugal in 1975 and the invasion by indonesian forces .
correspondents say the presidential role is likely to be ceremonial , as the country 's constitution calls for a parliamentary style of government .
guerrilla hero the bbc 's richard galpin in jakarta says mr gusmao has always been a reluctant politician , with even the decision to file for presidency being left to just before the deadline .
popular and charismatic , he is considered a hero in east timor after he commanded the guerrilla army falantil against indonesia during their occupation of east timor .
in 1992 he was captured in dili and jailed for life by the indonesian authorities , before being freed in 1999 eight days after east timor voted for independence .
after the vote a campaign of killings and destruction by pro-jakarta militias gripped the territory until the arrival of an australian-led international peacekeeping force .
since then it has come under united nations administration , and mr gusmao has worked hard with both sides to ensure a peaceful transition of power .
east timor will assume full independence on 20 may following the april elections .

so says peter tippett , the computer security pioneer who now runs trusecure , a company dedicated to spotting the next big security problem before the vandals and malicious hackers exploit it .
although good technologies are emerging to help companies tackle problems such as web worms , denial of service attacks and website defacements , too little attention is paid to working out new threats and educating people in the basic steps they can take to protect themselves .
as a result , said mr tippett , many organisations were taking action that did little to help them tackle the real risks and security problems they faced .
flight plan peter tippett was co-author of vaccine , one of the first anti-virus programs released in the days when viruses spread via floppy disks rather than race around the world in e-mail .
but although the net had grown up , the allied security industry had not , said mr tippett .
he likens the net now to the early days of aviation when there was little co-ordination of knowledge about the safest way to fly a plane , how to repair them or the basic standards of airworthiness to which aircraft should be built .
now , government-backed organisations co-ordinate air-traffic control to ensure the skies are safe , monitor the maintenance programmes of airlines , certify new aircraft as safe to fly , distribute information about improvements that should be made to aircraft and force airlines to make the changes to their fleets .
the net desperately needs something similar , believes mr tippett .
" in internet security there 's no-one that can tell you what are the 20-30 things organisations should do that are essential for security , " he said .
" there 's also no mechanism for distributing information about problems and what must be done to solve them . "
instead , said mr tippett , the net had a vast array of security experts , software companies and hacker groups pumping out information about security vulnerabilities that often overwhelmed the people inside companies trying to protect their networks .
under attack as a result , many companies do a poor job of addressing the real threats .
most employees are told to change their passwords regularly and to ensure they contain a mixture of numbers and letters .
but , said mr tippett , few companies tackled the much bigger security problem caused when one employee used another unattended terminal to damage a company 's network or commit a crime .
now , said mr tippett , companies were spending more money than ever on security but the problem was only getting worse .
for instance , in may 1999 , there were only 15 websites defaced every day .
by may last year , the figure had leapt to 580 .
virus outbreaks can also hit companies hard .
trusecure estimates that 68 % of western companies suffered from the attentions of the nimda worm .
many of trusecure 's clients avoided nimda thanks to the early warning system set up by the company .
mr tippett said trusecure monitors the activity of 800 hacker groups and collects 200 gigabytes of net traffic per day to try to work out what the next big threat was going to be .
it regularly issues guidance to its clients about what they can do to protect themselves from these future attacks .
this monitoring system helped it spot that something like code red and nimda would happen months before the virulent , malicious programs actually struck .
often , said mr tippett , a few simply steps could vastly reduce the chance of a particular attack succeeding .
now , trusecure is working with many governmental groups to try to spread information about the basic things that companies can do to protect themselves , and to ensure that when significant threats emerge the right people are told about them quickly enough .

the truce , which will be observed by small teams headed by international monitors , has caused great excitement in the predominantly tamil north of the island .
this is the area worst-affected by the two decades of ethnic conflict .
but some members of the majority sinhalese community in the south believe their government has made too many concessions .
details the ceasefire agreement - signed by prime minister ranil wickremesinghe and the rebels - is open-ended , but either side can give 14 days ' notice to terminate the agreement .
this detailed document stipulates not only how the two sides ' military forces should behave with one another , but also a range of measures to restore normal life for civilians , and a timetable for implementation .
this includes provisions for an unimpeded flow of non-military goods into rebel areas , opening up of road and rail links in the conflict areas , and the easing of restrictions on fishing .
the idea is to build the right environment of goodwill and confidence to begin talking about a final political settlement .
suspicions persist but the norwegians who have been mediating in the peace process have warned that the two sides are embarking on a long road towards a political solution that will involve risks , uncertainties and hard choices .
already there are signs of some opposition to the agreement in the south of sri lanka , with the prime minister 's rival , president chandrika kumaratunga , complaining she was not consulted .
she described this as " undemocratic " .
the president still wields considerable power as commander in chief of the army , and she herself narrowly survived an assassination attempt by the tamil tigers .
she said she was concerned about certain clauses in the ceasefire agreement .
many people share her reluctance to make concessions to the tigers , fearful that they will just use this lull in the fighting to recruit more soldiers and capture more territory .

the trust said the patient concerned had not displayed any symptoms of tb while she was on the ward .
she recently developed a cough and tested positive for the disease .
effective treatment but due to the length of the incubation of the disease , tests are being offered as the patient could have been infectious while she was on the ward .
dr bates added : " although it is expected the results of all testing will prove to be negative , if any baby does test positive for infection , a three-month course of antibiotics will be administered which babies of that age can cope with very well .
