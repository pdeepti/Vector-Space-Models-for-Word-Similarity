" we have an agreement " , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen told reporters after two days of hard haggling . " this has been a very successful summit " , he said .
" it represents a major step forward towards the historic decision on enlargement " . leaders agreed to let the eu 's farm budget – which stands at around 40 billion euros – swell to 45 billion euros by 2006 , increasing by 1 percent per year until 2013 to offset inflation . in addition , farm subsidies for new member states will be gradually phased in over a period of nine years , and newcomers will receive 23 billion euros in structural aid over the first three years .

" we have an agreement " , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen told reporters after two days of hard haggling . " this has been a very successful summit " , he said .

" if europe wants to maintain its political and economic position in an age of globalization ; if its economy is to be productive and competitive enough to keep on providing europeans with the same , or even better , prospects of prosperity , then europe needs to act as one in the core policy areas : economic , fiscal , monetary and social policy .

"
some people do face harassment perhaps because of their belief or their sexual orientation and quite simply that 's wrong " barbara roche the biggest shake-up in workplace anti-discrimination laws for 25 years will be on the statute book by the end of next year .
the legislation will make discrimination against religion , belief or sexual orientation in the workplace unlawful in england , scotland and wales .
there has never been specific legislation in these areas before now , other than sexual and race discrimination laws .
experts believe the new laws could lead to fundamental changes in workplace culture - making bosses like ricky gervais of the hit bbc comedy , the office , a relic of the past .
out-of-hours drinking and any informal company business conducted in the pub could become the first casualty because of certain religions that do not permit the drinking of alcohol .
it is anticipated that companies with a strong drink culture could be vulnerable to claims from employees who feel they have been passed over for promotion because of their non-involvement in these social activities .
change afoot the proposed measures were enshrined in draft legislation and consultation papers published last week .
the first and most immediate change will be introduced in december 2003 .
public attitudes 2 % believe employers discriminate over religion or belief 10 % believe employers discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation 20 % believe employers discriminate on grounds of race source : british social attitudes survey -lrb- 2001 -rrb- this will make it illegal to discriminate against individuals on the grounds of their religion or belief or sexual persuasion .
this applies to all employees including agency workers and casual workers and , in many cases , to workers who are self-employed .
it wo n't , however , affect unpaid or voluntary work .
discrimination against jews and sikhs is already covered by the race relations act , but there is currently no protection in the uk - except in northern ireland - on the grounds of religion or belief .
under the new measures , however , religion and belief have not been defined - and it will be up to employment tribunals to establish the boundaries .
the government says atheists and humanists will also be protected .
sexual orientation the government estimates that between 5 % and 7 % of the population , or between 1.3 million and 1.9 million , will benefit from the legislation on sexual orientation .
it 's estimated that about 20 % of lesbians , gay men and bi-sexual employees have suffered discrimination at work due to their sexuality - and the proposals have been welcomed by campaigners .
some people in same-sex relationships may also get better pension rights .
the government believes that if a pension scheme already gives rights to unmarried couples , then it ca n't limit them to heterosexual couples .
european measures the measures are part of a package of european-wide employment law changes .
in addition , by 2006 , the government must also introduce measures banning ageism in the workplace and further extend disability legislation .
barbara roche , the government 's minister in charge of equality , told bbc news online that the proposals would help many people .
" i think it is a major step forward in equality provision .
equality and diversity are n't an add-on .
it 's about mainstream activity . "
ms roche praised many employers for the work they were doing in this area , but she said people still faced discrimination in the workplace .
" some people do face harassment perhaps because of their belief or their sexual orientation and quite simply that 's wrong , " she said .
extra regulation in the accompanying literature , the government has set out the cost benefits to individuals and employers .
for example , the one-off cost of enforcing the religion and belief anti-discrimination legislation across the uk will be £ 13.9m , and then a further £ 2m a year .
however , the government argues that more opportunities , better wages and improved skills will benefit workers to the tune of £ 9m annually .
" there is a lot in here for business , " says ms roche .
" if you can have measures which help you retain your employees , and have a happier workforce that makes good business sense as well . "
wider issues rachel dineley , partner in employment at law firm beachroft wansbroughs , says employers will have to become much better informed , particularly in relation to the religion and belief measures .
employers may be required to provide prayer rooms or allow employees to take time off for religious commitments .
while this could lead to a more tolerant society , she says , it may breed resentment among some workers .
" i think it will be very interesting to see how this plays out in practice . "
one concern she has is that religion and belief have not been defined under the proposals - and she envisages lengthy battles that could go as far as the european court .
the government is keen to stress the lengths to which it is consulting with business , but the repercussion could be wide-ranging .
" we 've never had anything like this before , " says ms dineley .
" what is radically different about this legislation is that it principally concerns what people think .
" it is going to be very interesting as to whether employers are going to be called upon to play the role of ' thought police ' . "

tonight sees the opening of a new show based on hits by the legendary 80s band madness .
breakfast talked to the group 's lead singer suggs .
they were as much as part of the early 1980s as margaret thatcher , shoulder pads and the sinclair c5 .
madness were best known for hits such as our house , one step beyond , driving in my car , and their only number one , house of fun .
baggy trousers became a school yard anthem .
suggs , real name graham macpherson , recalls : " i think part of the reason madness is still held in great esteem is that it encapsulates something in people 's lives - that 's what people tell me anyway , that it was when they were growing up , or met their girlfriends .
" there are four or five madness singles that they relate to some of the happier times of their lives . "
the group split in 1986 , reforming as a quartet called the madness which itself split after one album .
disastrous business moves suggs adds : " what made us so charming and real had been the fact we 'd always been managed by our mates , and we 'd always done our own thing .
in the end , there was a point when we needed to work out what the next step was .
" there needed to be some sort of plan , and that 's what we did n't have . "
the group made some enormous errors financially , including setting up a record label and studios .
they also made a film called take it or leave it - and the audience left it .
" it would have been great if someone had come in and said : ' look guys , just concentrate on what you 're good at . '
" we should have taken some time off and started again maybe a couple of years later , but we kept ploughing on and lost our sparkle . "

tonight sees the opening of a new show based on hits by the legendary 80s band madness .
breakfast talked to the group 's lead singer suggs . / b > click here to watch our interview with suggs .
they were as much as part of the early 1980s as margaret thatcher , shoulder pads and the sinclair c5 .
madness were best known for hits such as our house , one step beyond , driving in my car , and their only number one , house of fun .
baggy trousers became a school yard anthem .
suggs , real name graham macpherson , recalls : " i think part of the reason madness is still held in great esteem is that it encapsulates something in people 's lives - that 's what people tell me anyway , that it was when they were growing up , or met their girlfriends .
" there are four or five madness singles that they relate to some of the happier times of their lives . "
the group split in 1986 , reforming as a quartet called the madness which itself split after one album .
disastrous business moves suggs adds : " what made us so charming and real had been the fact we 'd always been managed by our mates , and we 'd always done our own thing .
in the end , there was a point when we needed to work out what the next step was .
" there needed to be some sort of plan , and that 's what we did n't have . "
the group made some enormous errors financially , including setting up a record label and studios .
they also made a film called take it or leave it - and the audience left it .
" it would have been great if someone had come in and said : ' look guys , just concentrate on what you 're good at . '
" we should have taken some time off and started again maybe a couple of years later , but we kept ploughing on and lost our sparkle . "

they have called off planned strike action on tuesday to allow for further talks with their employers .
union officials in northern ireland met on monday to discuss the situation ahead of talks with their national employers later in the week .
their representative , jim barbour , will be attending national talks on wednesday as efforts continue to resolve the dispute .
" to allow for meaningful dialogue between ourselves , our national employers and senior government officials , the union has decided to suspend strike action in the coming day , " said mr barbour .
" clearly we see that as an important move on our part . "
there is speculation the government had signalled it would improve a rejected offer of 4 % before an independent pay review in december .
the deputy prime minister john prescott said he would bring forward various pay and modernisation elements of the review , by queen 's university vice-chancellor sir george bain , to aid an end to the strikes .
' good news ' in northern ireland , about 900 full-time firefighters and 800 part-time or retained officers , who belong to the main union , were planning to take part in the stoppage .
northern ireland office public safety minister des browne said the decision was " good news for northern ireland " .
" i 'm pleased that the fire brigades union has agreed to sit down with the employers for talks on pay and modernisation .
" it 's in all our interests that this dispute is resolved , " said mr browne .
as the decision to postpone the strike was announced on saturday , three firefighters were injured while tackling a blaze in north belfast .
there was a false report that children had been trapped in a derelict church on tennent street .
they were searching the burning building when part of the roof caved in .
the men were treated in hospital for bruising .
union members are demanding a pay rise for firefighters and control room staff to bring both groups up to a £ 30,000 a year basic wage for the more experienced .
