2000 decision of the federal cartel office to forbid giant american retailer wal-mart and german discounters aldi and lidl from slashing prices on basic groceries .
in an effort to gain market share and facing stiff competition from the well-established aldi and lidl chain , wal-mart lowered prices in may 2000 on basic food items such as milk below those charged by aldi and lidl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2002 german-danish border serves as model for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flensburg is home to both germans and danes germany and denmark can be proud of their post-war solutions to minority issues along their shared border .
their success story influences governmental policies throughout europe . for the 20,000 germans in the south of denmark and the 50,000 danes in the north of germany the border between the two countries has a different meaning than for most people .
the ties that bind the two countries are particularly bloody and the ethnic minorities have felt the brunt of it .
" it was difficult for the german minority during the war , " recalls dieter wernich , who experienced the nazi occupation of denmark as a member of the german minority in southern jutland .
" as a citizen - we were danish citizens too - you try to be loyal to the state in which you live and then to your people , to whose culture you still feel drawn to , " he told dw-radio .
the wounds have largely healed now - in no small part thanks to the 1955 bonn-copenhagen declaration which allowed the minority communities on both sides of the border equal cultural rights to members of the respective majority cultures in germany and denmark .
now the balance created over the last 50 years on the german-danish peninsula serves as a model for border regions throughout europe .
peaceful co-existence representatives from both sides praise the work of the state government in schleswig-holstein , germany 's most northern region .
many years ago the parliament there created a commission to deal exclusively with both minorities .
not only do parliamentarians and minority representatives meet twice a year to discuss relevant issues , but the state 's premier is also advised on issues concerning minorities and ethnic groups by a commissioner for minority affairs .
germany 's danes have developed their own infrastructure , which ranges from a german-danish newspaper to danish-language schooling , libraries and pastors .
three members of the german-danish political party exercise mandates in the current schleswig-holstein government .
" it took a long time , but now it 's been set up so that these minorities can maintain their independence ... " says dieter küssner , a member of the danish secretary general in germany and the rector of a danish school in flensburg .
" actually everything was set up so that you can lead a cultural life from the cradle to the deathbed according to your own terms , " he explains , referring to the danish-speaking community in germany .
in denmark , the country 's constitution guarantees the german minority the right to maintain its culture .
but conflicts do arise again and again .
the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger , " which represents germans in southern jutland , for example , is quick to explain how a german teacher was greeted with " heil hitler " in a danish school .
the organization , however , is largely satisfied with danish governmental policies towards minorities .
a model for europe the german-danish success story has become a model for other european border regions .
hungary and rumania , both fairly progressive countries when it comes to dealing with minorities , have looked to the northern european example to improve their own policies .
hungarian politicians oriented themselves on schleswig-holstein when they passed a law on minorities , considered to be the most modern in southeastern europe .
border regions everywhere in europe are meeting points for different cultures , which are often even marked by a unique border culture reflecting a mixture of the different national or ethnic groups who live there .
the cross-border minorities have the opportunity to act as bridges between the two countries .
a positive influence according to dieter küssner , the implications of minorities ' roles can not be underplayed : " this bridge function - because we can move around in both or more cultures - is very , very important and is a positive element .
you have to say to these border regions have a potential that 's significant , also for the future of europe . "
hans heinrich hansen from the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger " goes even further .
he believes that minorities have a lot to teach the dominant cultures within a united europe , particularly when it comes to national identity and the eu .
" that is something that the majority populations in europe still have to learn .
they are in the midst of the learning process .
the minorities are much further .
and that 's where the majority populations could learn from the minority populations what double loyalty means .

their success story influences governmental policies throughout europe . for the 20,000 germans in the south of denmark and the 50,000 danes in the north of germany the border between the two countries has a different meaning than for most people .
the ties that bind the two countries are particularly bloody and the ethnic minorities have felt the brunt of it .
" it was difficult for the german minority during the war , " recalls dieter wernich , who experienced the nazi occupation of denmark as a member of the german minority in southern jutland .
" as a citizen - we were danish citizens too - you try to be loyal to the state in which you live and then to your people , to whose culture you still feel drawn to , " he told dw-radio .
the wounds have largely healed now - in no small part thanks to the 1955 bonn-copenhagen declaration which allowed the minority communities on both sides of the border equal cultural rights to members of the respective majority cultures in germany and denmark .
now the balance created over the last 50 years on the german-danish peninsula serves as a model for border regions throughout europe .
peaceful co-existence representatives from both sides praise the work of the state government in schleswig-holstein , germany 's most northern region .
many years ago the parliament there created a commission to deal exclusively with both minorities .
not only do parliamentarians and minority representatives meet twice a year to discuss relevant issues , but the state 's premier is also advised on issues concerning minorities and ethnic groups by a commissioner for minority affairs .
germany 's danes have developed their own infrastructure , which ranges from a german-danish newspaper to danish-language schooling , libraries and pastors .
three members of the german-danish political party exercise mandates in the current schleswig-holstein government .
" it took a long time , but now it 's been set up so that these minorities can maintain their independence ... " says dieter küssner , a member of the danish secretary general in germany and the rector of a danish school in flensburg .
" actually everything was set up so that you can lead a cultural life from the cradle to the deathbed according to your own terms , " he explains , referring to the danish-speaking community in germany .
in denmark , the country 's constitution guarantees the german minority the right to maintain its culture .
but conflicts do arise again and again .
the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger , " which represents germans in southern jutland , for example , is quick to explain how a german teacher was greeted with " heil hitler " in a danish school .
the organization , however , is largely satisfied with danish governmental policies towards minorities .
a model for europe the german-danish success story has become a model for other european border regions .
hungary and rumania , both fairly progressive countries when it comes to dealing with minorities , have looked to the northern european example to improve their own policies .
hungarian politicians oriented themselves on schleswig-holstein when they passed a law on minorities , considered to be the most modern in southeastern europe .
border regions everywhere in europe are meeting points for different cultures , which are often even marked by a unique border culture reflecting a mixture of the different national or ethnic groups who live there .
the cross-border minorities have the opportunity to act as bridges between the two countries .
a positive influence according to dieter küssner , the implications of minorities ' roles can not be underplayed : " this bridge function - because we can move around in both or more cultures - is very , very important and is a positive element .
you have to say to these border regions have a potential that 's significant , also for the future of europe . "
hans heinrich hansen from the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger " goes even further .
he believes that minorities have a lot to teach the dominant cultures within a united europe , particularly when it comes to national identity and the eu .
" that is something that the majority populations in europe still have to learn .

the ruling lends teeth to a sept .
2000 decision of the federal cartel office to forbid giant american retailer wal-mart and german discounters aldi and lidl from slashing prices on basic groceries .
in an effort to gain market share and facing stiff competition from the well-established aldi and lidl chain , wal-mart lowered prices in may 2000 on basic food items such as milk below those charged by aldi and lidl .
the companies responded by dumping their prices as well , with milk dropping to as little as 43 cents per liter and sugar as low as 75 cents a kilogram .
commerce associations and trade unions in germany have warned that such price wars will lead to substantial job losses . the court has ruled that the constant selling of products under their purchase costs hampers smaller competitors and must be banned .
however , the hindrance of smaller and medium-sized competitors does not need to become apparent in order to enforce a ban , the court said . more briefs 12.11.2002 -pipe- hypovereinsbank plans eastward expansion 12.11.2002 -pipe- bayer to slash jobs as sales slump 12.11.2002 -pipe- german employers pay more , get less 12.11.2002 -pipe- beiersdorf ’ s sales rise thanks to nivea 12.11.2002 -pipe- mobilcom founder admits he sold shares 11.11.2002 -pipe- deutsche telekom faces biggest-ever loss 11.11.2002 -pipe- commerzbank to slash more jobs 11.11.2002 -pipe- thomas cook slashes 500 jobs radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2002 german-danish border serves as model for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flensburg is home to both germans and danes germany and denmark can be proud of their post-war solutions to minority issues along their shared border .
their success story influences governmental policies throughout europe . for the 20,000 germans in the south of denmark and the 50,000 danes in the north of germany the border between the two countries has a different meaning than for most people .
the ties that bind the two countries are particularly bloody and the ethnic minorities have felt the brunt of it .
" it was difficult for the german minority during the war , " recalls dieter wernich , who experienced the nazi occupation of denmark as a member of the german minority in southern jutland .
" as a citizen - we were danish citizens too - you try to be loyal to the state in which you live and then to your people , to whose culture you still feel drawn to , " he told dw-radio .
the wounds have largely healed now - in no small part thanks to the 1955 bonn-copenhagen declaration which allowed the minority communities on both sides of the border equal cultural rights to members of the respective majority cultures in germany and denmark .
now the balance created over the last 50 years on the german-danish peninsula serves as a model for border regions throughout europe .
peaceful co-existence representatives from both sides praise the work of the state government in schleswig-holstein , germany 's most northern region .
many years ago the parliament there created a commission to deal exclusively with both minorities .
not only do parliamentarians and minority representatives meet twice a year to discuss relevant issues , but the state 's premier is also advised on issues concerning minorities and ethnic groups by a commissioner for minority affairs .
germany 's danes have developed their own infrastructure , which ranges from a german-danish newspaper to danish-language schooling , libraries and pastors .
three members of the german-danish political party exercise mandates in the current schleswig-holstein government .
" it took a long time , but now it 's been set up so that these minorities can maintain their independence ... " says dieter küssner , a member of the danish secretary general in germany and the rector of a danish school in flensburg .
" actually everything was set up so that you can lead a cultural life from the cradle to the deathbed according to your own terms , " he explains , referring to the danish-speaking community in germany .
in denmark , the country 's constitution guarantees the german minority the right to maintain its culture .
but conflicts do arise again and again .
the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger , " which represents germans in southern jutland , for example , is quick to explain how a german teacher was greeted with " heil hitler " in a danish school .
the organization , however , is largely satisfied with danish governmental policies towards minorities .
a model for europe the german-danish success story has become a model for other european border regions .
hungary and rumania , both fairly progressive countries when it comes to dealing with minorities , have looked to the northern european example to improve their own policies .
hungarian politicians oriented themselves on schleswig-holstein when they passed a law on minorities , considered to be the most modern in southeastern europe .
border regions everywhere in europe are meeting points for different cultures , which are often even marked by a unique border culture reflecting a mixture of the different national or ethnic groups who live there .
the cross-border minorities have the opportunity to act as bridges between the two countries .
a positive influence according to dieter küssner , the implications of minorities ' roles can not be underplayed : " this bridge function - because we can move around in both or more cultures - is very , very important and is a positive element .
you have to say to these border regions have a potential that 's significant , also for the future of europe . "
hans heinrich hansen from the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger " goes even further .
he believes that minorities have a lot to teach the dominant cultures within a united europe , particularly when it comes to national identity and the eu .
" that is something that the majority populations in europe still have to learn .
they are in the midst of the learning process .
the minorities are much further .
and that 's where the majority populations could learn from the minority populations what double loyalty means .

their success story influences governmental policies throughout europe . for the 20,000 germans in the south of denmark and the 50,000 danes in the north of germany the border between the two countries has a different meaning than for most people .
the ties that bind the two countries are particularly bloody and the ethnic minorities have felt the brunt of it .
" it was difficult for the german minority during the war , " recalls dieter wernich , who experienced the nazi occupation of denmark as a member of the german minority in southern jutland .
" as a citizen - we were danish citizens too - you try to be loyal to the state in which you live and then to your people , to whose culture you still feel drawn to , " he told dw-radio .
the wounds have largely healed now - in no small part thanks to the 1955 bonn-copenhagen declaration which allowed the minority communities on both sides of the border equal cultural rights to members of the respective majority cultures in germany and denmark .
now the balance created over the last 50 years on the german-danish peninsula serves as a model for border regions throughout europe .
peaceful co-existence representatives from both sides praise the work of the state government in schleswig-holstein , germany 's most northern region .
many years ago the parliament there created a commission to deal exclusively with both minorities .
not only do parliamentarians and minority representatives meet twice a year to discuss relevant issues , but the state 's premier is also advised on issues concerning minorities and ethnic groups by a commissioner for minority affairs .
germany 's danes have developed their own infrastructure , which ranges from a german-danish newspaper to danish-language schooling , libraries and pastors .
three members of the german-danish political party exercise mandates in the current schleswig-holstein government .
" it took a long time , but now it 's been set up so that these minorities can maintain their independence ... " says dieter küssner , a member of the danish secretary general in germany and the rector of a danish school in flensburg .
" actually everything was set up so that you can lead a cultural life from the cradle to the deathbed according to your own terms , " he explains , referring to the danish-speaking community in germany .
in denmark , the country 's constitution guarantees the german minority the right to maintain its culture .
but conflicts do arise again and again .
the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger , " which represents germans in southern jutland , for example , is quick to explain how a german teacher was greeted with " heil hitler " in a danish school .
the organization , however , is largely satisfied with danish governmental policies towards minorities .
a model for europe the german-danish success story has become a model for other european border regions .
hungary and rumania , both fairly progressive countries when it comes to dealing with minorities , have looked to the northern european example to improve their own policies .
hungarian politicians oriented themselves on schleswig-holstein when they passed a law on minorities , considered to be the most modern in southeastern europe .
border regions everywhere in europe are meeting points for different cultures , which are often even marked by a unique border culture reflecting a mixture of the different national or ethnic groups who live there .
the cross-border minorities have the opportunity to act as bridges between the two countries .
a positive influence according to dieter küssner , the implications of minorities ' roles can not be underplayed : " this bridge function - because we can move around in both or more cultures - is very , very important and is a positive element .
you have to say to these border regions have a potential that 's significant , also for the future of europe . "
hans heinrich hansen from the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger " goes even further .
he believes that minorities have a lot to teach the dominant cultures within a united europe , particularly when it comes to national identity and the eu .
" that is something that the majority populations in europe still have to learn .
they are in the midst of the learning process .
the minorities are much further .

their success story influences governmental policies throughout europe . for the 20,000 germans in the south of denmark and the 50,000 danes in the north of germany the border between the two countries has a different meaning than for most people .
the ties that bind the two countries are particularly bloody and the ethnic minorities have felt the brunt of it .
" it was difficult for the german minority during the war , " recalls dieter wernich , who experienced the nazi occupation of denmark as a member of the german minority in southern jutland .
" as a citizen - we were danish citizens too - you try to be loyal to the state in which you live and then to your people , to whose culture you still feel drawn to , " he told dw-radio .
the wounds have largely healed now - in no small part thanks to the 1955 bonn-copenhagen declaration which allowed the minority communities on both sides of the border equal cultural rights to members of the respective majority cultures in germany and denmark .
now the balance created over the last 50 years on the german-danish peninsula serves as a model for border regions throughout europe .
peaceful co-existence representatives from both sides praise the work of the state government in schleswig-holstein , germany 's most northern region .
many years ago the parliament there created a commission to deal exclusively with both minorities .
not only do parliamentarians and minority representatives meet twice a year to discuss relevant issues , but the state 's premier is also advised on issues concerning minorities and ethnic groups by a commissioner for minority affairs .

" actually everything was set up so that you can lead a cultural life from the cradle to the deathbed according to your own terms , " he explains , referring to the danish-speaking community in germany .
in denmark , the country 's constitution guarantees the german minority the right to maintain its culture .
but conflicts do arise again and again .
the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger , " which represents germans in southern jutland , for example , is quick to explain how a german teacher was greeted with " heil hitler " in a danish school .
the organization , however , is largely satisfied with danish governmental policies towards minorities .
a model for europe the german-danish success story has become a model for other european border regions .
hungary and rumania , both fairly progressive countries when it comes to dealing with minorities , have looked to the northern european example to improve their own policies .
hungarian politicians oriented themselves on schleswig-holstein when they passed a law on minorities , considered to be the most modern in southeastern europe .
border regions everywhere in europe are meeting points for different cultures , which are often even marked by a unique border culture reflecting a mixture of the different national or ethnic groups who live there .
the cross-border minorities have the opportunity to act as bridges between the two countries .
a positive influence according to dieter küssner , the implications of minorities ' roles can not be underplayed : " this bridge function - because we can move around in both or more cultures - is very , very important and is a positive element .

their success story influences governmental policies throughout europe . for the 20,000 germans in the south of denmark and the 50,000 danes in the north of germany the border between the two countries has a different meaning than for most people .
the ties that bind the two countries are particularly bloody and the ethnic minorities have felt the brunt of it .
" it was difficult for the german minority during the war , " recalls dieter wernich , who experienced the nazi occupation of denmark as a member of the german minority in southern jutland .
" as a citizen - we were danish citizens too - you try to be loyal to the state in which you live and then to your people , to whose culture you still feel drawn to , " he told dw-radio .
the wounds have largely healed now - in no small part thanks to the 1955 bonn-copenhagen declaration which allowed the minority communities on both sides of the border equal cultural rights to members of the respective majority cultures in germany and denmark .
now the balance created over the last 50 years on the german-danish peninsula serves as a model for border regions throughout europe .
peaceful co-existence representatives from both sides praise the work of the state government in schleswig-holstein , germany 's most northern region .
many years ago the parliament there created a commission to deal exclusively with both minorities .
not only do parliamentarians and minority representatives meet twice a year to discuss relevant issues , but the state 's premier is also advised on issues concerning minorities and ethnic groups by a commissioner for minority affairs .
germany 's danes have developed their own infrastructure , which ranges from a german-danish newspaper to danish-language schooling , libraries and pastors .
three members of the german-danish political party exercise mandates in the current schleswig-holstein government .
" it took a long time , but now it 's been set up so that these minorities can maintain their independence ... " says dieter küssner , a member of the danish secretary general in germany and the rector of a danish school in flensburg .
" actually everything was set up so that you can lead a cultural life from the cradle to the deathbed according to your own terms , " he explains , referring to the danish-speaking community in germany .
in denmark , the country 's constitution guarantees the german minority the right to maintain its culture .
but conflicts do arise again and again .
the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger , " which represents germans in southern jutland , for example , is quick to explain how a german teacher was greeted with " heil hitler " in a danish school .
the organization , however , is largely satisfied with danish governmental policies towards minorities .
a model for europe the german-danish success story has become a model for other european border regions .
hungary and rumania , both fairly progressive countries when it comes to dealing with minorities , have looked to the northern european example to improve their own policies .
hungarian politicians oriented themselves on schleswig-holstein when they passed a law on minorities , considered to be the most modern in southeastern europe .
border regions everywhere in europe are meeting points for different cultures , which are often even marked by a unique border culture reflecting a mixture of the different national or ethnic groups who live there .
the cross-border minorities have the opportunity to act as bridges between the two countries .
a positive influence according to dieter küssner , the implications of minorities ' roles can not be underplayed : " this bridge function - because we can move around in both or more cultures - is very , very important and is a positive element .
you have to say to these border regions have a potential that 's significant , also for the future of europe . "
hans heinrich hansen from the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger " goes even further .
he believes that minorities have a lot to teach the dominant cultures within a united europe , particularly when it comes to national identity and the eu .
" that is something that the majority populations in europe still have to learn .
they are in the midst of the learning process .
the minorities are much further .

their success story influences governmental policies throughout europe . for the 20,000 germans in the south of denmark and the 50,000 danes in the north of germany the border between the two countries has a different meaning than for most people .
the ties that bind the two countries are particularly bloody and the ethnic minorities have felt the brunt of it .
" it was difficult for the german minority during the war , " recalls dieter wernich , who experienced the nazi occupation of denmark as a member of the german minority in southern jutland .
" as a citizen - we were danish citizens too - you try to be loyal to the state in which you live and then to your people , to whose culture you still feel drawn to , " he told dw-radio .
the wounds have largely healed now - in no small part thanks to the 1955 bonn-copenhagen declaration which allowed the minority communities on both sides of the border equal cultural rights to members of the respective majority cultures in germany and denmark .
now the balance created over the last 50 years on the german-danish peninsula serves as a model for border regions throughout europe .
peaceful co-existence representatives from both sides praise the work of the state government in schleswig-holstein , germany 's most northern region .
many years ago the parliament there created a commission to deal exclusively with both minorities .
not only do parliamentarians and minority representatives meet twice a year to discuss relevant issues , but the state 's premier is also advised on issues concerning minorities and ethnic groups by a commissioner for minority affairs .
germany 's danes have developed their own infrastructure , which ranges from a german-danish newspaper to danish-language schooling , libraries and pastors .
three members of the german-danish political party exercise mandates in the current schleswig-holstein government .
" it took a long time , but now it 's been set up so that these minorities can maintain their independence ... " says dieter küssner , a member of the danish secretary general in germany and the rector of a danish school in flensburg .
" actually everything was set up so that you can lead a cultural life from the cradle to the deathbed according to your own terms , " he explains , referring to the danish-speaking community in germany .
in denmark , the country 's constitution guarantees the german minority the right to maintain its culture .
but conflicts do arise again and again .
the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger , " which represents germans in southern jutland , for example , is quick to explain how a german teacher was greeted with " heil hitler " in a danish school .
the organization , however , is largely satisfied with danish governmental policies towards minorities .
a model for europe the german-danish success story has become a model for other european border regions .
hungary and rumania , both fairly progressive countries when it comes to dealing with minorities , have looked to the northern european example to improve their own policies .
hungarian politicians oriented themselves on schleswig-holstein when they passed a law on minorities , considered to be the most modern in southeastern europe .
border regions everywhere in europe are meeting points for different cultures , which are often even marked by a unique border culture reflecting a mixture of the different national or ethnic groups who live there .
the cross-border minorities have the opportunity to act as bridges between the two countries .
a positive influence according to dieter küssner , the implications of minorities ' roles can not be underplayed : " this bridge function - because we can move around in both or more cultures - is very , very important and is a positive element .
you have to say to these border regions have a potential that 's significant , also for the future of europe . "
hans heinrich hansen from the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger " goes even further .
he believes that minorities have a lot to teach the dominant cultures within a united europe , particularly when it comes to national identity and the eu .
" that is something that the majority populations in europe still have to learn .
they are in the midst of the learning process .

their success story influences governmental policies throughout europe . for the 20,000 germans in the south of denmark and the 50,000 danes in the north of germany the border between the two countries has a different meaning than for most people .
the ties that bind the two countries are particularly bloody and the ethnic minorities have felt the brunt of it .
" it was difficult for the german minority during the war , " recalls dieter wernich , who experienced the nazi occupation of denmark as a member of the german minority in southern jutland .
" as a citizen - we were danish citizens too - you try to be loyal to the state in which you live and then to your people , to whose culture you still feel drawn to , " he told dw-radio .
the wounds have largely healed now - in no small part thanks to the 1955 bonn-copenhagen declaration which allowed the minority communities on both sides of the border equal cultural rights to members of the respective majority cultures in germany and denmark .
now the balance created over the last 50 years on the german-danish peninsula serves as a model for border regions throughout europe .
peaceful co-existence representatives from both sides praise the work of the state government in schleswig-holstein , germany 's most northern region .
many years ago the parliament there created a commission to deal exclusively with both minorities .
not only do parliamentarians and minority representatives meet twice a year to discuss relevant issues , but the state 's premier is also advised on issues concerning minorities and ethnic groups by a commissioner for minority affairs .
germany 's danes have developed their own infrastructure , which ranges from a german-danish newspaper to danish-language schooling , libraries and pastors .
three members of the german-danish political party exercise mandates in the current schleswig-holstein government .
" it took a long time , but now it 's been set up so that these minorities can maintain their independence ... " says dieter küssner , a member of the danish secretary general in germany and the rector of a danish school in flensburg .
" actually everything was set up so that you can lead a cultural life from the cradle to the deathbed according to your own terms , " he explains , referring to the danish-speaking community in germany .
in denmark , the country 's constitution guarantees the german minority the right to maintain its culture .
but conflicts do arise again and again .
the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger , " which represents germans in southern jutland , for example , is quick to explain how a german teacher was greeted with " heil hitler " in a danish school .
the organization , however , is largely satisfied with danish governmental policies towards minorities .
a model for europe the german-danish success story has become a model for other european border regions .
hungary and rumania , both fairly progressive countries when it comes to dealing with minorities , have looked to the northern european example to improve their own policies .
hungarian politicians oriented themselves on schleswig-holstein when they passed a law on minorities , considered to be the most modern in southeastern europe .
border regions everywhere in europe are meeting points for different cultures , which are often even marked by a unique border culture reflecting a mixture of the different national or ethnic groups who live there .
the cross-border minorities have the opportunity to act as bridges between the two countries .
a positive influence according to dieter küssner , the implications of minorities ' roles can not be underplayed : " this bridge function - because we can move around in both or more cultures - is very , very important and is a positive element .
you have to say to these border regions have a potential that 's significant , also for the future of europe . "
hans heinrich hansen from the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger " goes even further .
he believes that minorities have a lot to teach the dominant cultures within a united europe , particularly when it comes to national identity and the eu .
" that is something that the majority populations in europe still have to learn .
they are in the midst of the learning process .
the minorities are much further .

their success story influences governmental policies throughout europe . for the 20,000 germans in the south of denmark and the 50,000 danes in the north of germany the border between the two countries has a different meaning than for most people .
the ties that bind the two countries are particularly bloody and the ethnic minorities have felt the brunt of it .
" it was difficult for the german minority during the war , " recalls dieter wernich , who experienced the nazi occupation of denmark as a member of the german minority in southern jutland .
" as a citizen - we were danish citizens too - you try to be loyal to the state in which you live and then to your people , to whose culture you still feel drawn to , " he told dw-radio .
the wounds have largely healed now - in no small part thanks to the 1955 bonn-copenhagen declaration which allowed the minority communities on both sides of the border equal cultural rights to members of the respective majority cultures in germany and denmark .
now the balance created over the last 50 years on the german-danish peninsula serves as a model for border regions throughout europe .
peaceful co-existence representatives from both sides praise the work of the state government in schleswig-holstein , germany 's most northern region .
many years ago the parliament there created a commission to deal exclusively with both minorities .
not only do parliamentarians and minority representatives meet twice a year to discuss relevant issues , but the state 's premier is also advised on issues concerning minorities and ethnic groups by a commissioner for minority affairs .
germany 's danes have developed their own infrastructure , which ranges from a german-danish newspaper to danish-language schooling , libraries and pastors .
three members of the german-danish political party exercise mandates in the current schleswig-holstein government .
" it took a long time , but now it 's been set up so that these minorities can maintain their independence ... " says dieter küssner , a member of the danish secretary general in germany and the rector of a danish school in flensburg .
" actually everything was set up so that you can lead a cultural life from the cradle to the deathbed according to your own terms , " he explains , referring to the danish-speaking community in germany .
in denmark , the country 's constitution guarantees the german minority the right to maintain its culture .
but conflicts do arise again and again .
the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger , " which represents germans in southern jutland , for example , is quick to explain how a german teacher was greeted with " heil hitler " in a danish school .
the organization , however , is largely satisfied with danish governmental policies towards minorities .
a model for europe the german-danish success story has become a model for other european border regions .
hungary and rumania , both fairly progressive countries when it comes to dealing with minorities , have looked to the northern european example to improve their own policies .
hungarian politicians oriented themselves on schleswig-holstein when they passed a law on minorities , considered to be the most modern in southeastern europe .
border regions everywhere in europe are meeting points for different cultures , which are often even marked by a unique border culture reflecting a mixture of the different national or ethnic groups who live there .
the cross-border minorities have the opportunity to act as bridges between the two countries .
a positive influence according to dieter küssner , the implications of minorities ' roles can not be underplayed : " this bridge function - because we can move around in both or more cultures - is very , very important and is a positive element .
you have to say to these border regions have a potential that 's significant , also for the future of europe . "
hans heinrich hansen from the " bund deutscher nordschleswiger " goes even further .
he believes that minorities have a lot to teach the dominant cultures within a united europe , particularly when it comes to national identity and the eu .
" that is something that the majority populations in europe still have to learn .
they are in the midst of the learning process .
the minorities are much further .
and that 's where the majority populations could learn from the minority populations what double loyalty means .

this is an incredibly sophisticated cyber criminal ... he was a very busy guy " us attorney christopher christie over one year he allegedly stole passwords , deleted files , monitored traffic and shut down computer networks on military bases from pearl harbour to connecticut .

harman and mona o 'hara , from bideford , first received a demand for payment of £ 850 from npower , despite being loyal customers of british gas .
after being reassured that the bill was a mistake , they then received a second bill for £ 870 from the firm .
npower has said it will investigate why the o 'haras ' property is listed on its books .
imagine getting a bill addressed to the ' top floor flat ' , with no name .
it 's incredible mona o 'hara mr and mrs o 'hara have lived in their quayside flat for more than 30 years and have used gas for all of that time .
they have always been supplied by british gas , as 82-year-old harman used to work for the firm .
they also said they had never even spoken to a representative from npower .
mr o 'hara said of receiving the first demand : " well , it was very worrying to get a bill of that size . "
at first , the o 'haras ' daughter contacted the firm and was reassured that it was a mistake and the bill would be eradicated from the company 's computer .
the couple then received the second bill at their address .
n-power could not offer reasons for the bills harman o 'hara said : " the big worry is that if they carry on with this , they might take out a county court summons .
" that would blacklist the whole property and other people would suffer from it . "
mona o 'hara said : " how they got this address is beyond me .
they do n't even know our name .

a spokeswoman for npower said they had been unable to offer any reason for the bills .

they do n't even know our name .
" imagine getting a bill addressed to the ' top floor flat ' , with no name .
it 's incredible .
a spokeswoman for npower said they had been unable to offer any reason for the bills .
however , the firm said it would contact transco , the owners of the gas pipe system , to find out why the o 'hara 's address has appeared on the npower books .

half century-old green goddess military fire engines have been drafted into both counties to cover for the industrial action which is due to start at 1800 gmt on wednesday .
it is thought there will be up to five engines in cornwall and 12 based around devon .
both of the county 's fire brigades have said they have plans in place if there are any call-outs during the strike .
the ministry of defence will be co-ordinating green goddess coverage from hms drake in plymouth .
cornwall 's assistant chief fire officer , steve webster , said : " we have mapped our fire cover arrangements with our fire crews at retained stations .
" where we have a shortfall in any areas , we will be calling upon military resources .
" what we will be providing is a level of emergency fire cover where we are undertaking to continue to provide a response to fire calls and other incidents we are called with . "
in devon the county 's fire and rescue service has said that contingency arrangements are in place to provide emergency fire cover , fire safety enforcement and arson investigation .
the strike is being held as part of a campaign by the fire brigades union -lrb- fbu -rrb- for a pay rise of 40 % .
on monday , the fbu rejected the findings of an independent review which recommended the 11 % pay rise over two years , linked to changes in working practices .
' nightmare conditions ' the chairman of the devon branch of the fbu , dave chappel , said the government left them with no alternative but to strike .
he said : " because firefighting is a job that people want to be in , because we find it rewarding , basically we have to accept poverty pay and poor conditions and that is a nightmare . "
however , some parts of both counties may not be greatly affected because they have stations operated solely by retained firefighters .
the retained firefighters ' union -lrb- rfu -rrb- has said it will not be taking industrial action as it has a no-strike policy .
devon has 557 full-time firefighters and 744 retained .
cornwall has 181 full-time firefighters and 425 retained .
most of the retained firefighters belong to the rfu , although some belong to the fbu .
the advice is people should still call 999 if there is a fire .

commander brian paddick , britain 's highest-ranking openly gay officer , was moved from his £ 93,000 post after allegations were made by former boyfriend james renolleau in march . "
i absolutely loved the job , and given the opportunity , i would grab it with both hands " commander brian paddick the commander , who pioneered a " softly , softly " approach to cannabis possession , was accused of smoking the drug and allowing it to be smoked in his home , sparking an investigation by the crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- .
but in october it was announced there was insufficient evidence to prosecute mr paddick , who had always denied the allegations .
a report by deputy chief constable gordon clark of humberside police , who carried out a four-month inquiry into the claims , was sent to the metropolitan police authority -lrb- mpa -rrb- .
but on tuesday the mpa announced the case would not be referred to a tribunal hearing .
responding to the mpa 's decision , mr paddick said : " why have they made me endure eight months of hell ? "
" being the borough commander for lambeth was the job that i always wanted to do , " he told bbc2 's newsnight .
" i absolutely loved the job , and given the opportunity , i would grab it with both hands . "
' incredibly supportive ' mr paddick said he would request the chance to discuss his future with the metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens .
he said : " the commissioner has been incredibly supportive throughout this matter but i have n't had the opportunity to discuss with him why , after all of this , i can not go back and do that job again .
" i think it 's very important that i discuss the whole case with him . "
mr paddick has now been appointed to help implement the national intelligence model , the metropolitan police 's blueprint for reducing crime .
but supporters have called for him to be reinstated in lambeth .
mr paddick described his current role as " important " but " not the job that i would choose " .
in a letter to mr paddick , the mpa said he had " demonstrated lack of judgement " in allowing cannabis to be smoked on his premises and failing to take positive action to deal with it .
it also criticised him for failing to inform his superiors that his partner was on bail .
the mpa said if he found himself in a similar position they would expect him to " seek the guidance of a senior officer " .

italy 's tiscali , another big european isp , reported a core loss of 3.6m euros in the quarter , compared with a 44.8m loss for the same period last year .
revenues at t-online were 383m euros in the quarter , in-line with expectations , up from 270m a year ago , while at tiscali they slipped to 179.9m from 190.1m the previous year .
" the operating success of this year is based on sustainable and profitable subscriber growth , longer usage times and more revenues in advertising , e-commerce and services , " the company said in a statement .

the company said it was on track to break evne by the end of this year .
in the first quarter it became the first european isp to achieve a core profit , but fell back into the red in the second with a loss of 9.5m euros .

t-online shares have fallen 36 % this year , roughly similar to that of its main rival , wanadoo .

the isp , part of german telecoms giant deutsche telekom , had a core profit of 35.6m euros -lrb- $ 35.9m ; £ 22.6m -rrb- in the three months to september , but net losses more than doubled to 273m due to write-offs .
italy 's tiscali , another big european isp , reported a core loss of 3.6m euros in the quarter , compared with a 44.8m loss for the same period last year .
revenues at t-online were 383m euros in the quarter , in-line with expectations , up from 270m a year ago , while at tiscali they slipped to 179.9m from 190.1m the previous year .
" the operating success of this year is based on sustainable and profitable subscriber growth , longer usage times and more revenues in advertising , e-commerce and services , " the company said in a statement .
t-online provides internet access to 11.85 million people , mainly in the german market .
it has also cut losses at its french and spanish units , but still trails the local market leaders , france 's wanadoo and spain 's terra lycos .
online troubles tiscali has lost 600,000 customers in the last four quarters and last quarter cut its full year profit forecast .
the company said it was on track to break evne by the end of this year .
in the first quarter it became the first european isp to achieve a core profit , but fell back into the red in the second with a loss of 9.5m euros .
the company 's growth via acquisitions has been criticised because of its small cash reserves and high operating costs .
but despite a 56 % fall in its share price this year , rumours the company is a takeover target have stopped .
t-online shares have fallen 36 % this year , roughly similar to that of its main rival , wanadoo .

the survivors first group compiled a database listing 573 priests alleged of involvement in paedophilia cases since 1996 , using details from newspaper articles and , sometimes , court documents .
i know as a parent i ca n't trust the bishops victims ' advocate paul baier but the advocacy organisation - made up of catholics from around boston where the paedophile priest scandal broke earlier this year - said it had dropped 100 names from the list to allow for further research .
the publication of suspected molesters ' names came as us bishops continued to discuss ways of tackling the crisis which has dogged the church in the us .
a father 's fears paul baier , a software expert who has led the survivors first project , said the group had allegations from victims against 2,100 clerics in its files .
but he said he and his colleagues were being " incredibly cautious " about choosing who to name under the five website categories : priests convicted of crimes civil settlements in which criminal guilt was not admitted pending criminal cases pending civil cases other situations the list includes father david holley from worcester in massachusetts , now serving 275 years for molesting at least eight children , and john geoghan , the defrocked priest whose indecent assault trial sparked the scandal .
more than 130 people have accused geoghan of molesting them over a 30-year period and though his seniors knew of the abuse allegations , they moved him from parish to parish rather than reveal the problem .
mr baier , who was also a founder of the voices of the faithful organisation which is seeking church reform but is unrelated to survivors first , said he was not a victim .
but he said as the father of a four-year-old girl , he was appalled by the current situation : " i know as a parent i ca n't trust the bishops . "
' facts not emotions ' the website will also include false charges made against clergy .
bishops are being accused of protecting clergy at the expense of victims mr baier said the clerical sex abuse problem could sometimes seem exaggerated and suggested that the figure of 2,100 priests with claims against them should be compared with the 90,000 priests of the past generation rather than the 46,000 currently serving .
that would mean about 2.3 % of priests - a little over one in 50 - had been accused of abuse .
" we are trying to put the right data out there - facts , not emotions , " he said .
church plans the us conference of catholic bishops is holding its annual meeting in washington and is expected to revise the us church 's plans for " zero tolerance " of paedophile priests after criticism from the vatican .
conference president bishop wilton gregory said priests had felt " unfairly judged " because of the misbehaviour of a few colleagues .
he was among the us church leaders who agreed changes to the zero-tolerance policy with the vatican to give suspected priests more rights , but he has insisted that there will be no watering down of protection for children .
nevertheless , support groups for people who have been abused by the clergy have criticised the bishops and the vatican for what they say is protection for priests at the expense of their victims .

redditch council wanted to demolish 30 " prefabs " in the town 's dolphin row saying they were too costly to modernise .
but residents threatened to chain themselves to their kitchen sinks rather than let bulldozers demolish the homes .
now the council has had a rethink and decided the homes can stay .
minimal repairs thousands of prefabs were built just after the war years as a short-term solution to a national housing crisis .
the buildings , with aluminium roofs and walls , were only meant to last for a few years but their owners say they have proved ideal homes for more than half a century .
some people have bought their prefabs and have spent thousands of pounds renovating them .
redditch council intended to replace the prefabs with new homes .
but after a high-profile campaign , councillors have said the prefabs need minimal repairs and can stay .
one resident said : " at long last common sense has won the day , because nobody down here wanted these bungalows to go - especially the elderly and disabled . "
a final decision to ratify the proposal is due to be made by the full council early next month .
