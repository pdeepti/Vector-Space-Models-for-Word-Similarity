"
it is the sentence of this court that you be taken from this court to a prison and then to a place of execution where you will be hanged " high court judge michael scott speight was sentenced to death by hanging by the trial judge but the country 's president , josefa iloilo , signed a decree commuting the sentence .
earlier speight broke down and wept when the judge condemned him after a hearing lasting little more than an hour .
fiji is in the process of abolishing the death penalty .
correspondents say people sentenced to life in prison in fiji usually spend about 10 years behind bars .
speight , a charismatic former businessman , led an armed gang of nationalists who stormed fiji 's parliament in may 2000 and held the country 's first indo-fijian prime minister , mahendra chaudhry , hostage for 56 days .
' defending rights ' through his lawyer , speight said he wanted " to exercise his right to plead guilty at the first opportunity " as his trial opened on monday morning .
" this will be recognised as our contribution to the stability of this country and reconciliation , " said speight 's lawyer when he announced the guilty plea .
speight , who was being tried with 12 co-defendants , had always insisted his actions were carried out to defend indigenous rights , which he claimed were being undermined by mr chaudhry 's administration .
but no evidence was apparently heard before the judge accepted speight 's plea and passed judgement .
" it is the sentence of this court that you be taken from this court to a prison and then to a place of execution where you will be hanged , " said high court judge michael scott .
" and may the lord have mercy on you . "
ten of speight 's co-defendants later pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of keeping abducted prisoners in confinement - which carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison .
the other two still face treason charges .
divisions the eight weeks of the coup left a deep scar across the country .
racial divisions intensified between the indigenous majority and the powerful , ethnic indian community , whose ancestors were brought to the islands to work on colonial sugar plantations by the british more than 100 years ago .
unemployment and poverty have also increased and fiji 's political system has been thrown into chaos .
the hostage crisis of two years ago was brought to an end by a deal brokered by the military , which took control of the country during the stand-off .
amnesty cancelled it guaranteed speight immunity from prosecution .
but the agreement was later scrapped , and the former rebel leader was arrested and charged with treason .
senior army commanders accused him of breaching the conditions of the amnesty deal by failing to hand over weapons stolen from the military and used in the uprising .
speight and his group have been held on nukukau island , a former colonial quarantine station for indentured labourers brought in from india .
during his time in custody speight won a seat in parliament in the first election since the coup .
he was later expelled for failing to attend .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- asian economies on the mend categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 18 february , 2002 , 07:24 gmt asian economies on the mend singaporeans may have more to cheer soon while many of asia 's economies are stagnating or deep in recession , anecdotal evidence emerges from singapore , taiwan , south korea and australia that a recovery could be under way .
singapore 's economy , which has seen its exports collapse and the economy suffer its worst recession in 37 years , can finally hope for an end to the downturn .
non-oil exports in january still fell 4.1 % from a year ago , but the data were much better than the 16.7 % plunge experienced in december , and much more favourable than the 10 % decline forecast by economic analysts .
" we are on the path to recovery " said one economist , predicting a return to growth during the second quarter of the year .
singapore 's economy , however , is still smarting from a sharp contraction during the past year .
during 2001 , its gross domestic product fell 2.2 % .
this compares with a 9.9 % expansion during the boom time a year before .
but the 2.2 % drop is less than the 3 % contraction predicted by the government less than half a year ago , and in recent weeks , the government has become increasingly confident about the economic outlook .
until recently it predicted the downturn would continue well into 2002 .
now prime minister goh chok tong says he hopes for annual growth of 1-3 % .
taiwan recovery in taiwan , meanwhile , officials are busy raising the growth target as well .
asian stock markets had a dire time , but have begun to recover according to a report in the china times , the directorate general of budget , accounting and statistics plans to revise this year 's growth forecast to 2.5 % , and ponders to push it as high as 3 % .
until now the growth forecast was just a nudge above 2 % .
the official figures are expected to be released on friday .
last year , taiwan slipped into a recession - defined as six months of a shrinking economy - for the first time since 1951 , when the island 's government began to take economic measurements .
on 1 january taiwan joined the world trade organisation .
this is expected to put a lot of domestic industries - especially farming - under huge pressures , but is believed to ultimately give an economic boost through export earnings .
south korea 's unemployment lines shorten south korea 's economy had a good start to the new year as well , with unemployment -lrb- on a seasonally adjusted basis -rrb- down to 3.2 % in january - a four year low .
analysts expect that the economic recovery in the united states will help south korea to pull through the global slowdown unscathed .
exports have fallen sharply in recent months , but domestic spending was strong enough to sustain the economy , which is believed to have grown about 3 % last year .
many other asian countries fell into recession during 2001 .
south korea is asia 's third largest economy , and suffered terribly during the asian financial crisis in the late 1990s .
massive corporate restructuring and economic reforms helped the country to prepare for the latest slowdown .
buoyant australia during the past year australia has been the big surprise among asia 's economies .
after a poor start to 2001 , the country managed to outperform most of its neighbours , and looks set to continue on this path .
the economic prospects are " pretty good " , according to glenn stevens , deputy governor of the reserve bank of australia .
in the first major speech by an australian central banker this year , mr stevens told the committee for economic development of australia - an economic policy think tank - that " the economy has clearly coped with the international downturn pretty well so far , and there are good reasons for confidence about its performance over the coming year " .
however , mr stevens sounded a note of caution , saying that the biggest threat to the world economy might well be japan .
us president george w bush , who is currently on a state visit in tokyo , underscored this argument , saying japan 's economic recovery was " important not only for our bilateral relations , it 'll help the region and it will help the world " .

although moss bros did not name the potential buyer , shami ahmed , the entrepreneur behind the joe bloggs jeans label , acknowledged later in the day that he was the bidder .
he had been widely named in weekend press reports as being on the verge of a hostile bid .
mr ahmed said in december that he was interested in buying the upmarket outfitter and has built up a 5.4 % shareholding , the independent newspaper reported on monday .
but the moss bros board said it has rejected an approach because of the " inadequate " price suggested , coupled with doubts about the bidder 's ability to pay .
there was an " apparent lack of committed funding for any proposed offer that might be forthcoming " , moss bros said .
mr ahmed 's offer of at least £ 37m , or 40 pence per share , valued moss bros at £ 36m .
this offered share holders a premium to friday 's closing share price of 37.75p for moss bros. following the rejection , a disappointed mr ahmed said " the company 's recent trading history has been lamentable " .
" it has been littered with strategy and management changes , profit warnings and increasing losses , " he said .
restructuring moss bros fell into the red last year to the tune of £ 16m after being hit by the costs of a drastic shake-up of its shop portfolio .
it countered with store closures , job cuts and a revamp to replace some lines with more casual clothing as traditional pinstripe suits have fallen out of fashion .
it said it would keep its cecil gee and hugo boss chain , but convert most of its suit company , savoy taylors guild and blazer outlets to a new format selling at " affordable " prices .
family stakes to succeed , any bid would need the backing of the moss and gee families who control 38 % of the company between them .
but the board has restated its belief in its existing strategy .
" the board is confident that the best and most certain approach to achieving value for shareholders is to support the new management team in returning the business to profitability and restoring its previous levels of financial performance , " said moss bros. mr wright is an experienced manager in the retail sector , the firm said .

the yen fell as some traders interpreted the comment as meaning the us favoured a devaluation of the japanese currency .
bush aides hastened to clear up the confusion , saying the president - in japan as part of an asian tour - had " misspoken " .
they said his comment had meant to be about japan 's problem of " deflation " - steadily falling prices , which depress spending and investment - not devaluation .
' upfront ' the need for economic reforms and the weakness of the japanese yen dominated talks with japan 's prime minister junichiro koizumi in tokyo .
speaking at a joint news conference , mr bush said the japanese prime minister had been upfront about his country 's economic problems .
mr koizumi had given " equal emphasis " to the need for japan to " clean up its billions of dollars in non-performing loans ... and make regulatory reforms " , mr bush said .
mr bush 's addition of a third item to this list - the need for " devaluation " of the yen - immediately triggered a drop in the japanese currency .
' he looked me in the eye ... '
mr bush said he was " confident " in the success of mr koizumi 's strategy : " when he looked me in the eye and told me that he is going to take measures necessary to improve all three , i believe him . "
mr koizumi for his part said his government was " making steady progress on reforms " .
" under any circumstances i will carry out structural reform .
without it japan 's economic growth can not be achieved , " he said .
prior to the meeting , the us president had ruled out intervention to prop up the japanese yen .
talking to reporters he said the marketplace should be the mechanism that decided the value of currencies .
support for koizumi japan is currently experiencing its third recession in a decade , with huge bad debts seen as the major obstacle to an economic revival .
mr koizumi promised major reforms when he came to power , but critics have doubted whether he can carry them out .
president bush said he thought mr koizumi would take the necessary action .
" i firmly believe the japanese economy needs significant reforms and restructuring , as well as a focus on its loan portfolios , " mr bush said .
" i am more than confident that the prime minister understands this and is willing to make difficult decisions , " he added .
" i believe my friend will be able to lead the economy out of its doldrums . "
the market knows best mr bush also said the market was the best way of deciding the value of currencies .
the yen has steadily fallen against the dollar since september , making japanese exports to the us cheaper .
last week a trade organisation representing the main us car makers called on mr bush to put pressure on japan to stop the yen 's fall .
but mr bush said the values should be left to the market .
" my position is that the marketplace ought to make the decisions about currency valuations , " he said .
" our government will continue to take steps necessary to make sure our dollar is a strong dollar by good fiscal policy , good monetary policy and good regulatory policy .
" our hope is first and foremost that the japanese government makes ... the right decisions to give the marketplace something to adjust to - in other words that they start the process of reform .
