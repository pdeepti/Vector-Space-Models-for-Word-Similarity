the figure for december is the worst since records began in the early 1950s .
since last summer , when the recession began to bite in earnest , japanese unemployment has climbed ever higher .
it is a novel and humbling experience for what was long the world 's most successful industrial economy .
slack demand is forcing the closure of thousands of small and medium size businesses every month .
bigger corporations are cutting jobs in the face of tough competition .
many are closing factories in high cost japan and shifting production overseas , particularly to china .
the global slowdown has hit japan hard , but this is much more than just a cyclical downturn .
banks under pressure economists say fundamental restructuring is needed , so that resources can be channeled into more productive areas .
the banks are under pressure to write off a huge burden of non-performing loans and that means more bankruptcies and even higher unemployment in the coming months .
despite the economic gloom , the prime minister , junichiro koizumi , remains as popular as ever .
the latest opinion poll gives him an approval rating of 72 % .
he has done little to alleviate the economic pain - if anything , his reform plans are contributing to the high unemployment rate .
but many are still attracted by his message that japan has to change and they see little alternative among mr koizumi 's rivals who offer no vision for the country 's future .

the us embassy in beijing said it remains troubled by the case of li guangqiang , who is reported to have been sentenced to two years in prison for bringing thousands of bibles to a religious group that is banned as a cult in china .
state department spokesman richard boucher said washington expected china to live up to international standards of freedom of religious expression .
when li was arrested last may , president bush placed him at the top of washington 's list of dissidents it wanted released ; correspondents say such pressure is believed to be a reason li was not handed a harsher sentence .
li was originally accused of spreading " an evil cult " - a crime that can carry the death penalty in china .
but earlier this month , the charges against him were suddenly downgraded to charges of illegal trading .
with president bush 's trip to china only three weeks away , our correspondent in beijing says beijing is keen to counter allegations that it still engages in religious repression , particularly against china 's christian minority .
li was sentenced on monday by a court in fuqing in southern china 's fujian province .
two men accused of helping him were jailed for three years .
christian group china earlier this month rejected us concerns over the case , saying that no other country should interfere with china 's judicial independence .
the us state department had called on beijing to meet the standards on freedom of religious expression laid down in the universal declaration of human rights .
li , 38 , was delivering to the bibles to a group called the shouters , a evangelical group in south-eastern china .
followers shout out their devotion .
it is one of the fastest-growing underground religious organisations in china and is believed to have around 500,000 followers .
in 1995 the organisation was banned as an " aberrant religious organisation " .

mr verwaayen , who officially takes up his new position on friday , said such a move would make " no sense " , the paper reported .
last year , the german bank westlb made an £ 18bn offer for the network , but this was rejected by bt .
in november last year bt floated off its wireless operations into a separate company mmo2 .
offers last summer westlb approached bt with a sale and leaseback offer for the fixed-line network , which valued the business at £ 18bn .
the offer was rebuffed , but there were reports later in the year that westlb might try again with a higher offer .
also last year , a private equity group called earthlease bid £ 8bn for part of the fixed-line network .
it was interested in buying the ' local loops ' - the wires running from homes to the local telephone exchange .
but at a press conference in munich mr verwaayen said the company was not interested in any offers for the network .
the decision was welcomed by telecoms analysts .
" the other -lrb- bt -rrb- businesses are not ready for bt to sell -lrb- its fixed-line business -rrb- , " david brundis , telecoms analyst at jp morgan chase told the ft .

mr verwaayen , who officially takes up his new position on friday , said such a move would make " no sense " , the paper reported .
last year , the german bank westlb made an £ 18bn offer for the network , but this was rejected by bt .
in november last year bt floated off its wireless operations into a separate company mmo2 .
offers last summer westlb approached bt with a sale and leaseback offer for the fixed-line network , which valued the business at £ 18bn .
the offer was rebuffed , but there were reports later in the year that westlb might try again with a higher offer .
also last year , a private equity group called earthlease bid £ 8bn for part of the fixed-line network .
it was interested in buying the ' local loops ' - the wires running from homes to the local telephone exchange .
but at a press conference in munich mr verwaayen said the company was not interested in any offers for the network .
the decision was welcomed by telecoms analysts .
" the other -lrb- bt -rrb- businesses are not ready for bt to sell -lrb- its fixed-line business -rrb- , " david brundis , telecoms analyst at jp morgan chase told the ft .

bbc news online looks at the history of desert island discs , which celebrates 60 years on tuesday .
the show 's format , which has evolved gradually over the years , is simple .
each week a guest is invited onto the programme to select eight records they would take with them onto a desert island .
this being a radio 4 island , there is already a bible - or religious work of your choice - and some shakespeare to keep your mind ticking over .
in addition to the eight records , the castaway can select a book and a luxury item which must be inanimate and have no practical use .
these are comparatively recent additions to the island - the luxury item came along in the 1950s , the book a decade later .

the idea came to him after his coal fire went out in his digs in hertfordshire in 1941 , although he later said a feature in a 1930s magazine may have been another inspiration .
american comedian vic oliver was the first guest when the show was recorded at a bomb-damaged maida vale studios , london , on 27 january 1942 .
it was transmitted two days later .
oliver was performing in a west end musical at the time , and so was available when plomley 's first choice - dr cem joad of the brains trust - said he was busy .
performers , literary critics , and radio personalities made up many of the show 's early guests .
a cosy mix of highbrow names and showbusiness stars sustained the show through its early decades , with desert island discs taking its place on bbc radio 4 's first day in 1967 .

guests were rarely embarrassed , and plomley - who was also the first host of comedy show one minute please , which later became just a minute - built up a reputation for hardly asking any questions at all .
