marine scientists say archaeological remains discovered 36 metres -lrb- 120 feet -rrb- underwater in the gulf of cambay off the western coast of india could be over 9,000 years old .
the vast city - which is five miles long and two miles wide - is believed to predate the oldest known remains in the subcontinent by more than 5,000 years .
the site was discovered by chance last year by oceanographers from india 's national institute of ocean technology conducting a survey of pollution .
using sidescan sonar - which sends a beam of sound waves down to the bottom of the ocean they identified huge geometrical structures at a depth of 120ft .
debris recovered from the site - including construction material , pottery , sections of walls , beads , sculpture and human bones and teeth has been carbon dated and found to be nearly 9,500 years old .
lost civilisation the city is believed to be even older than the ancient harappan civilisation , which dates back around 4,000 years .
marine archaeologists have used a technique known as sub-bottom profiling to show that the buildings remains stand on enormous foundations .
the whole model of the origins of civilisation will have to be remade from scratch graham hancock author and film-maker graham hancock - who has written extensively on the uncovering of ancient civilisations - told bbc news online that the evidence was compelling : " the -lsb- oceanographers -rsb- found that they were dealing with two large blocks of apparently man made structures .
" cities on this scale are not known in the archaeological record until roughly 4,500 years ago when the first big cities begin to appear in mesopotamia .
" nothing else on the scale of the underwater cities of cambay is known .
the first cities of the historical period are as far away from these cities as we are today from the pyramids of egypt , " he said .
chronological problem this , mr hancock told bbc news online , could have massive repercussions for our view of the ancient world .
" there 's a huge chronological problem in this discovery .
it means that the whole model of the origins of civilisation with which archaeologists have been working will have to be remade from scratch , " he said .
however , archaeologist justin morris from the british museum said more work would need to be undertaken before the site could be categorically said to belong to a 9,000 year old civilisation .
" culturally speaking , in that part of the world there were no civilisations prior to about 2,500 bc .
what 's happening before then mainly consisted of small , village settlements , " he told bbc news online .
dr morris added that artefacts from the site would need to be very carefully analysed , and pointed out that the c14 carbon dating process is not without its error margins .
it is believed that the area was submerged as ice caps melted at the end of the last ice age 9-10,000 years ago although the first signs of a significant find came eight months ago , exploring the area has been extremely difficult because the remains lie in highly treacherous waters , with strong currents and rip tides .
the indian minister for human resources and ocean development said a group had been formed to oversee further studies in the area .
" we have to find out what happened then ... where and how this civilisation vanished , " he said .
