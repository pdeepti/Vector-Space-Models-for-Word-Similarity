it 's about pushing yourself to the limit and beyond runner karim djebli the marathon takes place over seven days , across 230km of the sahara desert , in baking heat .
they say the dunes are the worst , the liquid sand seeping from under your feet with each step , sapping your energy , the slopes reflecting the heat inwards like a satellite dish .
and at this time of year the temperature in north-west sahara can reach 50 degrees .
dehydration , exhaustion and blisters are just some of the hazards the runners will face .
' endurance test ' then there are the sand storms , and the snakes ; all participants are required to carry a snake venom pump in their kit , along with signal flares , in case they get lost .
there will be precious little shade in the desert it is more like an endurance test than a sport , so why would 630 people from 30 different countries around the world want to put themselves through it ?
karim djebli from casablanca , is one of them .
he and his wife ran the race in 2000 , and are coming back this year for more .
" it 's about pushing yourself to the limit and beyond , " he said . "
you lose yourself , and forget all your petty domestic troubles .
it 's remarkable , like living in a dream . "
and then there is the beauty of the desert , with its changing colours and the variety of terrain , including mountains , rocky plains and palm groves .
worthy cause most days the runners will cover between 30 and 40 km , except the fourth day which is a gruelling 71km , a race that stretches into the night .
they must carry all their own food and kit - with the organisers providing only water , medical care and open-sided berber tents , which get whisked away at sunrise .
but it 's not all fun ; the race also raises money , this year for facing africa , a charity fighting against the gangrenous infection noma .
and at the end , sunburnt , aching and blistered , the competitors are rewarded with a banquet and a night of luxury in a four star hotel in ourzazate .
' experience ' but for runners such as karim leaving the desert behind is not easy .
" you have a sense of loss , and you feel this wrench going back into the modern world with its comforts , " he said .
" you feel lost like an orphan , you miss the close friends you 've made over the week , and you miss the whole experience a lot , " he added .
and when the runners have limped home , and the organisers have packed up their tents and their solar pumps , and incinerated their rubbish , the desert will be left again for another year to the nomads and the shifting sands .

the recall left firestone 's image in tatters bridgestone / firestone was expected to begin delivering tyres to the 500,000 gm cars later this month , according to the japanese newspaper nihon keizai .
the us subsidiary of the japanese tyre maker bridgestone hoped that the deal would help restore its image which had been badly dented by two recalls totalling 10 million tyres during the last two years .
the multi-million dollar recalls followed a string of fatal accidents involving ford explorer cars fitted with firestone tyres .
deaths explorer rollover accidents blamed on firestone tyre tread separations have been linked to 271 deaths and 800 injuries .
both companies have faced hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits in courts in the us and other countries .
the two companies have suffered huge financial losses as a consequence and the chief executives of both firestone and ford have been replaced .
dispute ford has insisted the fault lied with the tyres while bridgestone / firestone has said the car was to blame .
in february , the us authorities dropped an investigation requested by firestone into the ford explorer .
" the data does not support firestone 's contention that explorers stand out from other suvs with respect to its handling characteristics following a tread separation , " said the national highway traffic safety administration administrator jeffrey runge after having reviewed safety data .
the dispute brought to an end a 95-year relationship between the car maker and the tyre maker .
however , talks between the two have been resumed in recent months .
observers said the gm deal could help restore confidence in the firestone tyres .
