but her part in the current movie monster 's ball is an indication of the actress 's ability to take on more serious roles .
a tense tale of grief and inter-racial love , monster 's ball contains echoes of berry 's first role which attracted critical approval - that of vivian in spike lee 's 1991 film jungle fever .
in monster 's ball , she plays leticia musgrove , who finds herself involved in an inter-racial romance in america 's deep south .

after working with lee she partnered comic actor eddie murphy in 1992 's boomerang , and a couple of years appeared as the dishy secretary sharon stone in the flintstones .
swordfish topped the us box office in bulworth , a satire on us racial politics , she was praised for her role when she starred as a street smart young woman who takes up warren beatty 's struggling politician .
greater acclaim followed in 1999 , when she portrayed the doomed black american actress dorothy dandridge in a made-for-cable tv film .
the role won her a golden globe and an emmy award .

berry has now proved herself across genres like comedy , action films and serious drama .

" we have reached the regrettable but unavoidable decision that there is no choice but to make further compulsory redundancies , " chairman and chief executive richard li said in a letter to staff .
mr li said that sluggishness in the hong kong economy and intensifying competition in the fixed-line telephone sector had forced the company to slim down , and warned that he could not rule out further lay-offs .
pccw , which employed 14,000 at the end of 2001 , announced close to 1,000 redundancies last year .
back in profit last week , pccw reported a 2001 net profit of $ 243m -lrb- £ 171m -rrb- , slightly beating expectations .
pccw ran up debt when it swallowed c & w hkt a year earlier , pccw suffered a net loss of $ 886m - a figure that was restated to $ 16.6bn after a change in local accounting rules .
pccw bought hong kong 's incumbent telecoms company , hkt , from cable & wireless in august 2000 and was briefly one of asia 's most fashionable companies .
but it has suffered since the telecoms market was deregulated ahead of schedule , and its debts started to alarm the stock market .

julia roberts handed denzel washington his award almost every public event in the us since the attacks on new york has paid tribute to the heroism of rescue workers or the spirit of freedom .
but the academy wanted to turn its event into an articulation of the freedom of expression and the part movies play .
it was all quite surreal and unnecessary and it was quite a relief when oscar presenter whoopi goldberg descended from the heavens and launched into a moulin rouge pastiche .
" so much mud has been thrown this year all the nominees look black , " joked goldberg , defusing two of the biggest talking points of the oscar campaign in one gag .
oscar presenters often walk the line between taste and tastelessness and goldberg daringly made a jokey comparison between 11 september and mariah carey 's first film , glitter .
introspection and justification ?
there was plenty of it and a lot more soul-searching to come , a lot more .

halle berry gave gwyneth paltrow a run for her money woody allen , well-known as someone who tends to avoid the oscars , was brought on to introduce a film about new york and the movies and received a standing ovation .
great romantic " for new york city i will do anything , " said allen .
" it is a great , great movie town .
it is a great romantic and exciting backdrop . "
it was not clear if the film or allen was celebrating the city for itself or as a location for filming .
of course , in between all of this a few awards were handed out in an extremely leaden show .
there were a lot of surprises - denzel washington beating hot favourite russell crowe , jim broadbent beating sir ian mckellen , halle berry pipping sissy spacek and randy newman winning finally after 16 previous nominations .
it was an important night for black actors - with an honorary oscar for ground-breaker sidney poitier , as well as the wins for berry and washington , who walked off with both the oscar and julia roberts wrapped around his midriff .
of the speeches , halle berry 's tearful , heart-rending eulogy to friends and family matched paltrow 's antics a few years ago .
dismissed as the first black actress to win the leading female performer award in the 74-year history of the academy 's history , her tears were understandable .
washington joked that he had been chasing poitier for 40 years , only for both men to get an oscar on the same night .
" i will always be following in your footsteps , sir , " said the best male actor winner to poitier .
broadbent 's chances of winning had been dismissed by a presenter on abc tv in america just seconds after interviewing the british star on the red carpet .
he said : " that 's what is great about people like jim .
they are just glad to be here even if they know they might not win . "
best joke " stone the crows , " said broadbent .

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- commissioner begins sex abuse inquiry categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 25 march , 2002 , 07:18 gmt commissioner begins sex abuse inquiry children 's commissioner for wales peter clarke has begun his first inquiry into allegations of sex abuse against award-winning writer and teacher who took his own life while awaiting trial .
john owen was the creator of the s4c youth drama series pam fi duw ?
-lrb- why me god ? -rrb- killed himself last october .
he was due to appear in court to face allegations of molesting school children at ysgol gyfun rhydfelen at pontypridd , south wales .
ysgol gyfun rhydfelen : mr owen taught at the school meanwhile , a lawyer acting for eight of his former pupils who have made claims of sex abuse , has demanded funding for legal representation for them .
mr clarke , who took up his ground-breaking role representing children in wales a year ago , has promised he will consider the application .
the three-month clywch inquiry began at 1000 bst at the glamorgan business centre in the university of glamorgan in pontypridd .
it will provide the first major test for mr clarke whose role was created in the wake of the sir ronald waterhouse inquiry into abuse in children 's homes in north wales .
seven of owen 's alleged victims - five men and two women - are due to give evidence to the inquiry .
mr clarke has said the inquiry would be , " fair , thorough and rigorous and will be completed as sensitively and speedily as possible " .
the commissioner has also written to south wales police asking that officers turn over the results of their investigation .
teaching profession however , the biggest teaching union in wales , the national union of teachers , has expressed fears that the clarke inquiry will demoralise the entire teaching profession .
an inquest in december heard mr owen killed himself with an overdose of morphine after being accused of assaulting school children over a 10-year period .
the former drama teacher from tylorstown in the rhondda , was found dead inside a holiday caravan at trecco bay at the south wales seaside resort of porthcawl in october .
the inquest in pontypridd heard evidence that after he was charged with abuse , mr owen had had feelings of betrayal and bewilderment and had began to contemplate suicide .
peter clarke is to examine issues involved coroner phillip walters said he was satisfied it was these allegations which led to mr owen to commit suicide .
mr owen taught at ysgol gyfun rhydfelen until 1991 , when he quit amid complaints about his teaching methods .
he wrote the novel of pam fi duw ? after quitting teaching and the book went on to become a hit , six-series television drama .
s4c was criticised for screening the final programme in the last series shortly after the discovery of mr owen 's body , but the latest series has been put on hold as inquiries are held .
although mr clarke 's role was created as a response to the waterhouse inquiry , his remit is not limited to investigating abuse .
he is allowed to comment on anything that affects children in wales .
in his first year in office , that has included a call to stop schools being built on former landfill sites and concerns about exam stress among children .
he also spoke out on behalf of 16-year-old suzanne turley from north wales in her battle to study at gordonstoun after wrexham council said it could not fund her place .
