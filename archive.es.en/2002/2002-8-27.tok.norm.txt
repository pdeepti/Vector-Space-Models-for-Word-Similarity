the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- . those regions affected by the disastrous flooding in eastern germany can rely on extensive immediate aid thanks to the so-called " flood victims support law " .
late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .
chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement that he felt people in germany understood the reform delay , as it evenly distributed the burden of providing financial assistance for flood-stricken regions and victims .

the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .
charities have collected millions in private donations and people are also helping each other locally .

a bitter setback for the east after schröder came into power in 1998 , he gave the project " aufbau ost " - the rebuilding of eastern germany - top priority .
but now , the floods have destroyed large parts of these measures .
the reconstruction effort in the flood-stricken areas of eastern germany will have to start all over again , schröder said .
the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .
charities have collected millions in private donations and people are also helping each other locally .
schröder noted that " the sense of solidarity in our society has grown enormously " .
but germany 's flood victims have also evoked the sympathy of people around the world .
there has been a large measure of help from european partner countries , russia , the united states , and even africa and asia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-wide wave of support for flood-stricken germany even as devastating floods ravaged germany , a flood of another kind inundated the country - namely financial donations to help the victims , with some of it from as far away as africa and sri lanka .

while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .

in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "
the ban is popular among ordinary spaniards , who are by and large disgusted by eta killings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.08.2002 flood relief on its way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaning up the mess in pirna the german cabinet has approved the draft law for helping the country 's flood victims .
the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- . those regions affected by the disastrous flooding in eastern germany can rely on extensive immediate aid thanks to the so-called " flood victims support law " .
late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .
chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement that he felt people in germany understood the reform delay , as it evenly distributed the burden of providing financial assistance for flood-stricken regions and victims .
a bitter setback for the east after schröder came into power in 1998 , he gave the project " aufbau ost " - the rebuilding of eastern germany - top priority .
but now , the floods have destroyed large parts of these measures .
the reconstruction effort in the flood-stricken areas of eastern germany will have to start all over again , schröder said .
the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .
charities have collected millions in private donations and people are also helping each other locally .
schröder noted that " the sense of solidarity in our society has grown enormously " .
but germany 's flood victims have also evoked the sympathy of people around the world .
there has been a large measure of help from european partner countries , russia , the united states , and even africa and asia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-wide wave of support for flood-stricken germany even as devastating floods ravaged germany , a flood of another kind inundated the country - namely financial donations to help the victims , with some of it from as far away as africa and sri lanka .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .
fairness in a fragile world " .
the document published by the heinrich-böll foundation says this will only lead to a repetition of all the ecological mistakes that industrial nations have already made .
its recommendations are grounded in the principles of ecological sustainability and equity .
in spite of different views on the ongoing process of globalization , the authors agree about the urgent need to re-integrate markets in a framework of social and environmental regulations and limitations on a local , regional , national and global level .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "
the ban is popular among ordinary spaniards , who are by and large disgusted by eta killings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .

dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.08.2002 flood relief on its way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaning up the mess in pirna the german cabinet has approved the draft law for helping the country 's flood victims .
the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- . those regions affected by the disastrous flooding in eastern germany can rely on extensive immediate aid thanks to the so-called " flood victims support law " .
late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .
chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement that he felt people in germany understood the reform delay , as it evenly distributed the burden of providing financial assistance for flood-stricken regions and victims .
a bitter setback for the east after schröder came into power in 1998 , he gave the project " aufbau ost " - the rebuilding of eastern germany - top priority .
but now , the floods have destroyed large parts of these measures .
the reconstruction effort in the flood-stricken areas of eastern germany will have to start all over again , schröder said .
the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .
charities have collected millions in private donations and people are also helping each other locally .
schröder noted that " the sense of solidarity in our society has grown enormously " .
but germany 's flood victims have also evoked the sympathy of people around the world .
there has been a large measure of help from european partner countries , russia , the united states , and even africa and asia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-wide wave of support for flood-stricken germany even as devastating floods ravaged germany , a flood of another kind inundated the country - namely financial donations to help the victims , with some of it from as far away as africa and sri lanka .

the country 's main railway company , deutsche bahn , estimates flood damage to the railway network will reach " tens of billion euro " .

the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- . those regions affected by the disastrous flooding in eastern germany can rely on extensive immediate aid thanks to the so-called " flood victims support law " .
late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .
chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement that he felt people in germany understood the reform delay , as it evenly distributed the burden of providing financial assistance for flood-stricken regions and victims .
a bitter setback for the east after schröder came into power in 1998 , he gave the project " aufbau ost " - the rebuilding of eastern germany - top priority .
but now , the floods have destroyed large parts of these measures .
the reconstruction effort in the flood-stricken areas of eastern germany will have to start all over again , schröder said .
the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .
charities have collected millions in private donations and people are also helping each other locally .
schröder noted that " the sense of solidarity in our society has grown enormously " .
but germany 's flood victims have also evoked the sympathy of people around the world .

dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .

users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- . those regions affected by the disastrous flooding in eastern germany can rely on extensive immediate aid thanks to the so-called " flood victims support law " .
late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .
chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement that he felt people in germany understood the reform delay , as it evenly distributed the burden of providing financial assistance for flood-stricken regions and victims .
a bitter setback for the east after schröder came into power in 1998 , he gave the project " aufbau ost " - the rebuilding of eastern germany - top priority .
but now , the floods have destroyed large parts of these measures .
the reconstruction effort in the flood-stricken areas of eastern germany will have to start all over again , schröder said .
the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .
charities have collected millions in private donations and people are also helping each other locally .
schröder noted that " the sense of solidarity in our society has grown enormously " .
but germany 's flood victims have also evoked the sympathy of people around the world .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .

dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .

followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "
the ban is popular among ordinary spaniards , who are by and large disgusted by eta killings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- . those regions affected by the disastrous flooding in eastern germany can rely on extensive immediate aid thanks to the so-called " flood victims support law " .
late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .
chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement that he felt people in germany understood the reform delay , as it evenly distributed the burden of providing financial assistance for flood-stricken regions and victims .
a bitter setback for the east after schröder came into power in 1998 , he gave the project " aufbau ost " - the rebuilding of eastern germany - top priority .
but now , the floods have destroyed large parts of these measures .
the reconstruction effort in the flood-stricken areas of eastern germany will have to start all over again , schröder said .
the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .
charities have collected millions in private donations and people are also helping each other locally .
schröder noted that " the sense of solidarity in our society has grown enormously " .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .
fairness in a fragile world " .
the document published by the heinrich-böll foundation says this will only lead to a repetition of all the ecological mistakes that industrial nations have already made .
its recommendations are grounded in the principles of ecological sustainability and equity .

dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9797 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "
the ban is popular among ordinary spaniards , who are by and large disgusted by eta killings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .
fairness in a fragile world " .
the document published by the heinrich-böll foundation says this will only lead to a repetition of all the ecological mistakes that industrial nations have already made .
its recommendations are grounded in the principles of ecological sustainability and equity .

dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .

the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- . those regions affected by the disastrous flooding in eastern germany can rely on extensive immediate aid thanks to the so-called " flood victims support law " .
late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .
chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement that he felt people in germany understood the reform delay , as it evenly distributed the burden of providing financial assistance for flood-stricken regions and victims .
a bitter setback for the east after schröder came into power in 1998 , he gave the project " aufbau ost " - the rebuilding of eastern germany - top priority .
but now , the floods have destroyed large parts of these measures .
the reconstruction effort in the flood-stricken areas of eastern germany will have to start all over again , schröder said .
the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .
charities have collected millions in private donations and people are also helping each other locally .
schröder noted that " the sense of solidarity in our society has grown enormously " .
but germany 's flood victims have also evoked the sympathy of people around the world .
there has been a large measure of help from european partner countries , russia , the united states , and even africa and asia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-wide wave of support for flood-stricken germany even as devastating floods ravaged germany , a flood of another kind inundated the country - namely financial donations to help the victims , with some of it from as far away as africa and sri lanka .

follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- . those regions affected by the disastrous flooding in eastern germany can rely on extensive immediate aid thanks to the so-called " flood victims support law " .
late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .
chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement that he felt people in germany understood the reform delay , as it evenly distributed the burden of providing financial assistance for flood-stricken regions and victims .
a bitter setback for the east after schröder came into power in 1998 , he gave the project " aufbau ost " - the rebuilding of eastern germany - top priority .
but now , the floods have destroyed large parts of these measures .
the reconstruction effort in the flood-stricken areas of eastern germany will have to start all over again , schröder said .
the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .
charities have collected millions in private donations and people are also helping each other locally .
schröder noted that " the sense of solidarity in our society has grown enormously " .
but germany 's flood victims have also evoked the sympathy of people around the world .
there has been a large measure of help from european partner countries , russia , the united states , and even africa and asia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-wide wave of support for flood-stricken germany even as devastating floods ravaged germany , a flood of another kind inundated the country - namely financial donations to help the victims , with some of it from as far away as africa and sri lanka .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .
fairness in a fragile world " .
the document published by the heinrich-böll foundation says this will only lead to a repetition of all the ecological mistakes that industrial nations have already made .
its recommendations are grounded in the principles of ecological sustainability and equity .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "
the ban is popular among ordinary spaniards , who are by and large disgusted by eta killings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "
the ban is popular among ordinary spaniards , who are by and large disgusted by eta killings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.08.2002 high-tech treasure hunts set to go global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to advances in global positioning system technology , people the world over are “ geocaching ” – high-tech hide and seek with the help of gps devices .
dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9800 dw-tv europe live europa aktuell we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "
the ban is popular among ordinary spaniards , who are by and large disgusted by eta killings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .

the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .
fairness in a fragile world " .
the document published by the heinrich-böll foundation says this will only lead to a repetition of all the ecological mistakes that industrial nations have already made .
its recommendations are grounded in the principles of ecological sustainability and equity .
in spite of different views on the ongoing process of globalization , the authors agree about the urgent need to re-integrate markets in a framework of social and environmental regulations and limitations on a local , regional , national and global level .

they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .
fairness in a fragile world " .
the document published by the heinrich-böll foundation says this will only lead to a repetition of all the ecological mistakes that industrial nations have already made .
its recommendations are grounded in the principles of ecological sustainability and equity .
in spite of different views on the ongoing process of globalization , the authors agree about the urgent need to re-integrate markets in a framework of social and environmental regulations and limitations on a local , regional , national and global level .
its key demand is a redistribution of rights and resources . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world summit opens with eu , us at odds as the world summit on sustainable development begins on on monday in johannesburg , south africa , fears of a growing transatlantic rift over environmental issues which may hinder decision-making overshadow the summit -lrb- august 26 , 2002 -rrb- www-links the german investment and development company deg more information on deg projects and activities .

late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .

the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit on the green road from rio to johannesburg steering environmental issues back on the political agenda world summit opens with eu , us at odds business -pipe- 27.08.2002 footing the development bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping people help themselves is a major topic at the earth summit in johannesburg the proportion of gross national product that wealthy industrial nations spend on development has fallen over the past decades .
but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .

dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "
the ban is popular among ordinary spaniards , who are by and large disgusted by eta killings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.08.2002 high-tech treasure hunts set to go global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to advances in global positioning system technology , people the world over are “ geocaching ” – high-tech hide and seek with the help of gps devices .
dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .
fairness in a fragile world " .
the document published by the heinrich-böll foundation says this will only lead to a repetition of all the ecological mistakes that industrial nations have already made .
its recommendations are grounded in the principles of ecological sustainability and equity .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .
fairness in a fragile world " .
the document published by the heinrich-böll foundation says this will only lead to a repetition of all the ecological mistakes that industrial nations have already made .
its recommendations are grounded in the principles of ecological sustainability and equity .
in spite of different views on the ongoing process of globalization , the authors agree about the urgent need to re-integrate markets in a framework of social and environmental regulations and limitations on a local , regional , national and global level .

it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta . accusing it of supporting terrorism , the spanish high court has banned the batasuna party for at least three years on charges that it funds and assists eta , the armed separatist group seeking an independent homeland in northern spain and parts of southwestern france .
the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .

the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- . those regions affected by the disastrous flooding in eastern germany can rely on extensive immediate aid thanks to the so-called " flood victims support law " .
late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .
chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement that he felt people in germany understood the reform delay , as it evenly distributed the burden of providing financial assistance for flood-stricken regions and victims .
a bitter setback for the east after schröder came into power in 1998 , he gave the project " aufbau ost " - the rebuilding of eastern germany - top priority .
but now , the floods have destroyed large parts of these measures .
the reconstruction effort in the flood-stricken areas of eastern germany will have to start all over again , schröder said .
the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .
a wave of public support an overwhelming surge of public spirit has been triggered by the flood crisis .
charities have collected millions in private donations and people are also helping each other locally .
schröder noted that " the sense of solidarity in our society has grown enormously " .
but germany 's flood victims have also evoked the sympathy of people around the world .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "

this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .

economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .

they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .

the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- . those regions affected by the disastrous flooding in eastern germany can rely on extensive immediate aid thanks to the so-called " flood victims support law " .
late monday , the german cabinet passed the draft law , which will fund the financial and reconstruction measures put together by the berlin government .
the relief package for the flood damages totals around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .
the largest chunk results from postponing of the next phase of a scheduled tax reform by one year to 2004 .
this will mobilize around 6.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in tax revenues , the government said .
other financial contributions include 1.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- by the european union , as well as 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 976 million -rrb- resulting from a reshuffling in the federal transport ministry 's budget .
the law is expected to be passed by the upper and lower houses of parliament by mid-september .
the conservative opposition , cdu / csu alliance , said they will approve the law despite its criticism of the postponement of the government 's tax reform .
chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement that he felt people in germany understood the reform delay , as it evenly distributed the burden of providing financial assistance for flood-stricken regions and victims .

the extent of the flood damages are still unclear .
but federal transport minister kurt bodewig said he expects approximate figures by the end of the week .
in an interview with german television ard , bodewig said it would then be decided in which order reconstruction would start .
according to bodewig , public infrastructure would take priority , given the enormous damage to rail and road systems , particularly in saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in saxony alone , which was hit hardest by the floods and which will receive the most aid , the state government estimates damages of some 15 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
saxony 's agriculture minister steffen flath said the damages for the state 's farmers would run up to 200 million euro -lrb- $ 195 million -rrb- .
he said 1,900 facilities with some 5,000 employees were affected .

dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .

parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.08.2002 high-tech treasure hunts set to go global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to advances in global positioning system technology , people the world over are “ geocaching ” – high-tech hide and seek with the help of gps devices .
dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the batasuna party has long denied it is the political wing of the eta , but those denials were n't enough to stop high court judge baltasar garzon from issuing a 375-page order accusing eta of " crimes against humanity " and from closing all offices and businesses of batasuna , considered by many to be closely linked with the armed group , whose attacks have killed more than 800 people since 1968 .
in addition , the judicial order bans the party from holding meetings or calling street demonstrations and shuts of water , electricity and telephone services at party offices .
batasuna representatives will not be allowed to run in next year 's local elections , although sitting parliamentarians and local council members will be allowed to continue to serve their terms .
batasuna 's leaders have said the party will appeal against the widely expected ruling .
police immediately prepared for unrest and possible eta reprisals .
batasuna officials had warned that a ban would lead to protests .
in bilbao , long a stronghold of radical basque nationalism , batasuna supporters formed a picket around one " people 's tavern , " establishments that garzon wrote act as recruitment centers for radicalized basque youths and fundraising centers for eta .
" we are going to remain here all day , helping the bartenders , to see if they dare to try and close the people 's taverns , " rosa , one batasuna supporter , told a reporter on the scene .
total ban the spanish parliament also met in an extraordinary session on monday to vote on a legal suit which will be presented to the country 's supreme court on friday calling for a total ban on the party .
the suit went forward on a vote of 295-10 , with 29 abstentions .
parliament passed a controversial law two months ago that makes political parties which justify terrorism , either explicitly or implicitly , responsible for it .
the prime minister called parliament back from its summer holiday on the basis that batasuna is now in breach of that law .
aznar was furious when batasuna refused to condemn the latest car bombing in a tourist resort which killed a six-year-old girl and a 57-year-old man .
batasuna 's refusals to condemn outright such violence , saying it has roots in the basque struggle for self-determination , have angered politicians across the political spectrum .
moderate basque nationalists claim the ban will not have the desired effect , and will only serve to turn the party into a democratic martyr and drive more nationalists into the arms of eta .
but politicians from the country 's mainstream parties said the ban was necessary to safeguard democracy .
" we gave them -lrb- batasuna -rrb- an opportunity to change their way of conducting politics and they spurned it by responding with threats and a challenge to the rule of law , " josé antonio bermudez de castro , parliamentary spokesman for the governing popular party , told reporters .
" now we are going to be implacable in applying the law . "
the ban is popular among ordinary spaniards , who are by and large disgusted by eta killings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.08.2002 high-tech treasure hunts set to go global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to advances in global positioning system technology , people the world over are “ geocaching ” – high-tech hide and seek with the help of gps devices .
dw-world had a go at a game that is now catching on in germany . it was an eerie experience , standing in a clearing , the dog panting in the humid semi-darkness in the background , accompanied only by the beeping of my gps device and the incesant whine of mosquitoes .
i thought back on the website i ’ d read before embarking on this quest which warned that the last stage of my quest would require some good old fashioned foraging .
so i began scything my way through a circle of waist high bracken , wondering if my search for buried treasure was really worth it .
but it was for the sake of investigative journalism , i told myself , that i had decided to try out a sport which is well known in the us , and is becoming increasingly popular in germany – geocaching .
treasure hunt for adults geocaching is a new craze that combines the children ’ s game ‘ treasure hunt ’ with grown-up computer-aided map reading – kind of a high-tech hide and seek .
the basic idea is to have individuals and organisations set up hidden ‘ caches ’ all over the world – usually small ' treasure chests ' of cds , cheap toys , trinkets , etc placed in weatherproof containers or boxes - and share the locations on the internet .
users can then use the location co-ordinates to find them with the help of global positioning system devices - electronic units that work with satellites to determine your location within around 2-7 metres almost anywhere on the planet .
once a cache is located , the finder is allowed to take something from it – but good geocachers are expected to add something to the mini treasure trove in return .
follow the trail before setting out on my first geocaching adventure , i located some co-ordinates in latitude and longitude close to my base in southern germany and headed off in the direction of the hohenzollern castle , in the dense woodland around the southern german town of hechingen .
armed only with a borrowed gps system , the requisite silly ‘ game name ’ – a fitting ‘ clueless ’ in my case - and a dog trained in mountain rescue , i began the search for my local cache .
for someone who finds regular maps a source of frustration , the gps seemed child ’ s play in comparison .
once i had the surrounding area in front of me on the flashing screen , and the ‘ waypoint ’ highlighted in helpful red , i just had to follow the directions given to me as i set off into the undergrowth .
advance in gps before may 2000 , the gps signals received by hand-held devices were intentionally degraded due to something called ' select availabilty ' -lrb- sa -rrb- which stopped public use of what was until then a mainly military application .
the clinton administration in the u.s. removed ' selective availability ' on may 1st , 2000 as a way to ' encourage acceptance and integration of gps into peaceful civil , commercial and scientific applications world-wide . '
two days later , the first cache was created in the american state of portland , with its location and details posted on a satellite navigation newsgroup ’ s internet site .
by the may 6 , the cache had been visited twice .
today , there are almost 10,000 caches scattered in 142 countries , around 300 of which are in germany .
in germany , the sport has been gaining popularity in recent months , not least due to the declining costs of gps units .
hand-held versions , easy to use and already popular with hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts , are available today for less than 100 euros . simple and ' green ' the game ’ s popularity has been helped by the fact that it is surprisingly simple .
all you need to do is enter a ‘ waypoint ’ where the geocache is hidden .
caches can contain just about anything – even though organisers draw the line at drugs , weapons and alcohol are unsuitable . once you find the cache , geocaching etiquette dictates that you take something from inside , leave something of your own and then record it in the on-line logbook .
leaving of gifts is encouraged .
the official web site suggests disposable cameras for recording that ‘ eureka ! ’ moment , cheap toys , gift certificates , money and gold bars .
although the game does involve tramping through undergrowth and locations off the beaten track , geocaching overall is an environmentally friendly quest .
caches are deliberately placed in areas where a minimal impact will be made on the natural surroundings and they are generally located on public property to discourage trespassing .
one cache is reported to be 11,000 feet above sea level , hidden in the colorado rocky mountains in the united states .
no one has found that one yet .
followers and hoaxers meanwhile out in my clearning , the dark had began seriously setting in and i seemed to be no closer to locating the exact position of the fabled cache , even after repeatedly circling the position of the red dot on the gps device .
the official web site did mention the fact that , as well as attracting thousands of dedicated followers , geocaching was acting as a magnet for a legion of hoaxers .
believing that i had been duped by a set of fictitious co-ordinates , i was slightly frustrated at first .
however , i soon took comfort from the fact that my quest had brought me into close proximity to a rather excellent beer garden . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official website for geocaching 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .
fairness in a fragile world " .
the document published by the heinrich-böll foundation says this will only lead to a repetition of all the ecological mistakes that industrial nations have already made .
its recommendations are grounded in the principles of ecological sustainability and equity .
in spite of different views on the ongoing process of globalization , the authors agree about the urgent need to re-integrate markets in a framework of social and environmental regulations and limitations on a local , regional , national and global level .

but there are other options to finance such assistance . official development aid - or oda - can not be the only possibility for helping developing nations .
while various schools of thought agree on this point , opinions are divided on which other means of financial assistance have the most potential for success .
" one group says , we have to trust the powers of private industry , " says professor gerd braun , chief economist at the german investment and development company deg .
" we have to mobilize resources in these countries and create conditions that move our resources there , and we have to open the markets . "
opponents of this theory , however , stand up for the classic version of development aid , he says .
industrial nations should finally fulfil their goal of spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on development aid .
at the same time , this camp demands that developing countries ' debts be waived .
they should also be given more rights to a say in international institutions - such as the world bank , the imf and the wto - which are still dominated by a few , large industrial nations .
deg 's braun is convinced that it is only a combination of both that can have a lasting effect on developing nations ' problems .
he also believes direct investment by foreign companies is a good means to economic development .
in addition to funds , technology and knowledge are brought into a country .
dead capital in many countries , administrative and banking systems need to be improved , he says .
this could be financed through oda .
subsequently , the available resources in these countries could be better used .
for example , many people own a small piece of land with a small house , which they live in .
but this land is mostly used only for agriculture .
a further development does n't take place , says braun .
in an industrialized society , the owner could go to the bank and take out a loan , using the property as collateral .
this would enable him to buy a small truck , operate a transport company or build a kiosk .
" that means , this asset is n't activated .
it is agriculturally , but not economically , " he says .
economist and nobel prize nominee hernando de soto calls this " dead capital " , which is capital outside the law .
this is related to the levels of trust people have in their countries .
the basis of this trust are the standard forms and legal documents which provided opportunities to uniformly identify people , wealth , and ownership , he says .
for example , there are buildings in both mexico and the u.s. where people work and live .
but de soto says there are 100 more things that the u.s. buildings do that the mexico buildings do n't .
they are being mortgaged , act as collateral , are places where things are delivered , and so on .
these sorts of uses are often not available to people in the developing world .
de soto estimates that 90 percent of egyptian businesses and people operate and live outside the legal system .
he acknowledges that their activities represent enterprise , but not a real market economy operating within the rule of law .
egypt 's poor own $ 245 billion in dead capital , which is 55 times of all foreign direct investment in egypt since napoleon 's time , he says .
so , according to de soto , the wealth , in fact , lies with the poor .
' ' they are not the problem , they are the solution , " he writes in his book the mystery of capital .
" in the midst of their own poorest neighborhoods and shantytowns , there are - if not acres of diamonds - trillions of dollars , all ready to be put to use if only we can unravel the mystery of how assets are transformed into live capital . "
ecological sustainability and equity one basic problem of financing developing aid remains , however .
many people believe that pure economic growth is the best measure to battle poverty .
but growth without consideration for limited natural resources is a flash in the pan , say the authors of the so-called " jo 'burg-memo .
fairness in a fragile world " .
the document published by the heinrich-böll foundation says this will only lead to a repetition of all the ecological mistakes that industrial nations have already made .
its recommendations are grounded in the principles of ecological sustainability and equity .
in spite of different views on the ongoing process of globalization , the authors agree about the urgent need to re-integrate markets in a framework of social and environmental regulations and limitations on a local , regional , national and global level .

foster 's , which is best known for its brand name lager , racked up wine sales of a $ 1.93bn -lrb- $ 1bn ; £ 699m -rrb- in the 12 months to the end of june , while beer sales were worth slightly less , at a $ 1.74bn.
foster 's posted a 20.6 % rise in profits for the the 12 months to 30 june , to a $ 560.9m.
the company , which has just over half of the australian beer market , bought californian wine maker beringer in 2000 .
it also owns the wolf blass brand of australian-made wine .
' gathering momentum ' foster 's hoped to offset the impact of changing tastes which have seen a slowing growth in beer sales - a strategy which appears to have paid off .
president and chief executive ted kunkel said the full year figures were " a real milestone without a doubt " for the 114-year-old company 's growth strategy .
he said it had been a year in which foster 's had had to stand up and demonstrate that its focus on wine as well as beer would deliver returns .
" the result clearly confirms foster 's is on track and the group is gathering momentum , " he said .
rising profile beer still beat wine in its overall contribution to profits .
profits from wine grew just over 30 % to a $ 486.6m , thanks to strong sales in north america .
beer profits improved by only 5.4 % to a $ 560.6m.
australian wine exports have expanded rapidly in recent years and are now challenging french wine for the number one slot in the uk market .
" we are seeing in australia in excess of 5 % per annum growth in terms of wine consumption , we are seeing even higher rates in the uk for australian wines , and in the us , " richard gibbs , head of economics at mcquarrie bank in sydney , told the bbc 's world business report .
foster 's beer brands include foster 's lager , victoria bitter and cascade premium .
as well as beringer in the us , it 's wine business includes the greg norman estates and the wolf blass and yellowglen labels , which are sold in europe and australia .
foster 's latest financial results were the first to include a full year 's earnings from beringer , which was bought for a $ 2.6bn at the end of 2000 . watch / listen on this story richard gibbs , mcquarrie bank in sydney " we are seeing in australia in excess of 5 % per annum growth in terms of wine consumption " see also : 12 feb 02 -pipe- business foster 's profits from wine business 10 may 01 -pipe- business foster 's ' not aware ' of heineken bid 24 dec 01 -pipe- business carling sold to us brewer 28 nov 01 -pipe- business interbrew eyes global expansion 23 jan 02 -pipe- business uk 's biggest brewer buys into india 03 dec 01 -pipe- business sab buys chinese breweries internet links : foster 's brewing group the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : hacker breaches credit card security job losses escalate at reuters new sec chief pledges tough line oil prices push higher rwanda denies drc plundering overseas sales drive wal-mart congo 's finance minister resigns blair keeps euro options open links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

wuhan had been braced for flooding after thunderstorms brought torrential rains to the area around china 's lake dongting , just as the battle to contain floodwaters there appeared to be won .
enlarge image areas at risk of flooding but the wuhan morning post said on tuesday that no danger spots had emerged , thanks in part to flood controls put in place after flooding in 1998 killed 4,000 people across the country .
this year the death toll from floods and landslides is close to 1,000 .
but as lake dongting 's water levels continued to fall on tuesday , china 's official media expressed hopes the worst was now over .
wang shucheng , minister of water resources , was quoted by the china daily as saying no major breaches had occurred along the main levees of the yangtze , even though the river has been hit by flood crests along its middle reaches .
the minister said that six flood peaks had passed through hunan province and caused no major damage .
but officials continued to monitor the situation , especially because of the continued risk of flash-flooding .
on monday , 59 millimetres of rain fell in 90 minutes around yueyang , a city of 600,000 on lake dongting .
the heavy shower did not raise the level of the lake , monitors said , but danger remained .
the dykes have been swamped for days " but if it goes on raining like this , the water level could start rising again , " one monitor said .
downstream from wuhan , the city of jiujiang , which sits on the river , is already on flood alert .
china 's official xinhua news agency said 24-hour patrols were monitoring embankments and 40,000 civilians ands troops were poised to fight any breaches .
the controversial three gorges dam now under construction is meant to bring the yangtze under control , but that will not be finished until 2009 .
according to environmentalists , the repeated floods in the yangtze region are partly the result of china 's degraded environment .

a three-month protest last year by loyalist residents at an ardoyne interface saw pupils of holy cross girls ' school being escorted to the school by the security forces on a daily basis .
board of governors chairman father aidan troy confirmed the number of new enrolments at the school had fallen by a third .
despite an end to the protest last november , which came after 12 weeks , father troy said tension in the area was still high .
if the wall is built , the school closes - it is as simple as that father aidan troy " i think now that the guns have come out on to the streets , the temperature has been raised quite significantly , " he said .
" i know there was a young man injured in a shooting in glenbryn earlier in the year but there is a feeling now that there has been a concerted effort to intimidate or to make life very , very difficult for the people in alliance avenue . "
he added the future of the school depended on plans by the office of the first and deputy first minister to build another ' peace wall ' along part of the ardoyne road .
' chance of survival ' residents in the largely protestant glenbryn area have demanded the measure to prevent attacks on their homes .
however , ardoyne residents are opposed to the wall as it would realign the route walked by children and parents to the school .
" i feel as chair of the board of governors , it is my duty to at least give the school the chance of survival , " he said .
" if the wall is built , the school closes .
it is as simple as that . "
father troy said the holy cross pupils had been failed by politicians both in the northern ireland executive and the british government .
father aidan troy : " worrying clouds ahead " " politically we have no solution , so it would be nice if we , as church leaders , could create a lead on this and work together .
" i am optimistic that we have the possibility of having a good year but there are worrying clouds there . "
last year 's dispute centred on alleged attacks on glenbryn homes by the larger nationalist community in ardoyne .
it was eventually resolved in november with a package , backed by the first and deputy first ministers , of enhanced security and social measures for the area .
however , a delay in implementing the proposals , in particular the realignment of the ardoyne road to keep the communities apart , has led to tension in recent months .
loyalist residents said they were considering their position , but said resuming the protest at the school was not an option .

well breakfast has been looking at how people here are doing their bit to improve the environment .
breakfast 's jane o 'brien was in fife , scotland .
she spoke to various people about how aware they were of the environment .
here are some of your comments : the other day i had a terse letter through my letter box complaining my recycling cans bottles etc had not been thoroughly washed - how much energy is involved in the hot water / soap and cleaning them out - surely in the year 2002 this is not necessary ?
suzie gouldson i used to recycle everything until i realised my efforts were lining the pockets of privatly owned recycling companies .
i suggest recycling should be run by and profited by our local authorities , at least we would all then feel a collective responsibility and a better reward factor .
neil batley i live under the braintree council , our rubbish is collected once a fortnight , one wheely bin only no extra bags .
the week in the middle the recycling is collected .
60 % of all household waste is successfully recycled .
we are a family of three including a baby and even with our disposable nappies we do n't fill our bin more than 2/3rds a fortnight .
why ca n't all boroughs do the same .
paula i would absolutely love to recycle more plastic .
show me the place in north london to do so .
there is n't .
i end up saving all my plastics to take down to sussex when i visit relatives and the plastics just pile up in my home .
plastics are one of the worst kinds of waste and there is virtually nowhere in london to recycle them .
joan scnieder bbc news online 's margaret ryan reports on how britain lags far behind its european counterparts when it comes to recycling .
on any collection day black rubbish bags full of recyclable material line the streets of britain .
but instead of being reused , the majority of the waste ends up being sent to landfill sites .
with stringent eu directives on recycling to be met , it is clear that something has to be done fast .
recycling is made easy for people -lsb- in other countries -rsb- because there are kerbside collections dagmar schmidt waste watch households in england and wales produced 25m tonnes of waste in 2000/01 .
but only 12 % of household waste in england is recycled or composted , according to the government 's own figures .
in stark contrast in switzerland more than half of all household waste is recycled , while in germany the figure is at least 48 % .
but the countries with the most exemplary recycling records have something in common - they combine kerbside collections with penalties for not recycling household waste .
heavy penalties if you live in geneva , in switzerland , and put recyclable material , like paper or glass , in your rubbish , you would be fined about 100 swiss francs -lrb- £ 35 -rrb- .
and in germany , rubbish disposal is expensive whether paying per bag or per individual wheelie bins .
recycling rates switzerland 52 % austria 49.7 % germany 48 % netherlands 46 % norway 40 % sweden 34 % usa 31.5 % england 12 % wales 7.9 % dagmar schmidt , of the uk charity waste watch , which encourages recycling , said there was a common element to the various schemes run by local authorities in countries with good recycling rates .
" recycling is made easy for people because there are kerbside collections , " she said .
this meant that the idea of charging those who chose not to use the recycling facilities was easier to swallow .
" but in the uk people on the whole do not have kerbside collections that work , " she added .
fly-tipping fears she argues that to guarantee a charging scheme would help encourage recycling , local authorities had to provide easy ways to get rid of waste - the alternative would be more fly-tipping .
but she is optimistic the situation could be turned around quickly once schemes were in place .
in australia the amount of household waste recycled was negligible until the 1990s when kerbside recycling collections were introduced .
but within eight years of their introduction , 59 % of waste was being recycled .
and in flanders , belgium , the amount of waste recycled increased from 18 % to 59 % in just seven years through kerbside collection , ms schmidt said .
nearly half of homes in the uk do have access to kerbside collections , according to government statistics .
pilot project hillingdon council , in west london , is one authority which has introduced a fortnightly kerbside recycling scheme .
phased in to 80,000 households since 1998 , it is to roll out to a further 20,000 homes by next year .
household waste it is growing by 3 % a year in england and wales 43 % of households are now served by ' kerbside ' collection schemes nine out of 10 people would recycle more waste if it was made easier about 500 kg or half a tonne of household waste per person was collected in 2000/01 source : defra under the scheme , paper , cardboard , cans and plastic bottles can be put in clear bags for doorstep collections .
a spokeswoman said there were no statistics yet on the scheme 's success , but early indications were that take-up of the service was gradually improving .
the council was already exceeding national targets for recycling , she added .
future initiatives , such as kerbside green waste -lrb- garden waste -rrb- collection , were being planned from next year subject to government funding .
the charity friends of the earth wants a new law for mandatory doorstep recycling to ensure such schemes are replicated .
environment secretary margaret beckett said earlier this year : " we need all councils in england to do what they can to provide the public with easy-to-find and easy-to-use recycling facilities .
" it is already happening in many parts of the country - it needs to happen in every borough " .
but there is undoubtedly a long way to go if ministers are to succeed in meeting eu directives to recycle 25 % of household rubbish by 2005 , rising to at least 33 % by 2015 .

the group had sued the japanese government , demanding an apology for its use of germ warfare against chinese citizens and ten million yen -lrb- $ 84,000 -rrb- each in compensation .
but the three judges did acknowledge the facts of the case , the first time a japanese court has admitted japan conducted biological warfare during world war ii .
the court ruled that under international law , individuals had no right to seek compensation from a state .
a spokesperson for the group expressed outrage at the decision .
the group 's lawyers said they were encouraged that the judges had accepted the existence of the biological warfare unit and the acts it had performed .
lawyers said the plaintiffs were likely to appeal .
horrifying details evidence was given at the trial that 3,000 people were killed by plague and cholera cultivated by japanese military scientists during world war ii .
for five years , the tokyo district court heard harrowing testimony about japan 's unit 731 , which developed biological weapons for use against chinese civilians and carried out experiments and vivisections on them .
unit 731 's activities were covered up following world war ii witnesses told how japanese aircraft sprayed a mixture of fleas and wheat grain over villagers in eastern china in 1940 and 1941 .
shortly afterwards there were outbreaks of bubonic plague in which hundreds died .
a former member of unit 731 told how he had worked to cultivate plague , cholera and anthrax .
he said he had helped infect chinese prisoners with the germs and had assisted surgeons who then cut them up alive .
the plaintiffs wanted the japanese government to acknowledge the existence of the unit and to give details of its activities .
' cover-up ' unit 731 's role was covered up after the war and none of its members were charged , following an agreement with the occupying american forces .
japanese courts normally back the government 's position , that all claims were settled in bilateral peace treaties signed after the end of the war .
in recent years the courts have rejected similar claims by slave labourers conscripted by the japanese military , and by the so called " comfort women " who were forced to serve in army brothels . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's charles scanlon " there was an angry reaction outside the court " see also : 31 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific japan germ programme in dock 02 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific japanese cabinet donates to wwii fund 09 jul 01 -pipe- asia-pacific row revives memories of bitter past 29 mar 01 -pipe- asia-pacific japan overturns sex slave ruling 08 dec 00 -pipe- asia-pacific sex slaves put japan on trial 06 feb 01 -pipe- asia-pacific japan ' covered up ' germ warfare 01 feb 02 -pipe- correspondent unit 731 : japan 's biological force internet links : japanese cabinet chinese government the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : s korea subway inferno toll rises us plays down n korean threat thai pm says officials peddling drugs australia refuses to lift bali warning chinese official vows to end corruption japanese emperor back to work leatherbacks ' extinct in 30 years ' new project to demine tajikistan links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

the president has instructed us to go all out , get them and so that 's what we 're going to do defence secretary angelo reyes however , officials from the philippines military said that they had received no response from the guerrillas and therefore a military assault was the next logical step .
the four were part of a group of eight abducted on the southern island of jolo last week .
two muslim members were freed , but the severed heads of two other hostages were found on thursday .
the abu sayyaf is best known for kidnapping for ransom , though the us and philippines governments link the group to osama bin laden 's terrorist network .

about 4,000 soldiers , including us-trained counter-terrorism troops , have been sent to root out the extremist muslim militants in jolo .
but analysts warn that jolo island is home to several armed groups with sometimes shifting loyalties .
this , combined with the jungle terrain , may make the guerrillas difficult to track down .
jolo army chief brigadier general romeo tolentino said the gunmen and their captives were believed to be constantly moving in dense jungle to evade troops .
" our troops are combing the jungle inch for inch , but the kidnappers are constantly on the run , " he said .

the hostage taking and beheading marked a severe setback for the philippines ' security forces .
only a few weeks ago american and philippine officials said the army had destroyed the abu sayyaf and its base on nearby basilan island had been wiped out .

this is the summit of superlatives .
it is , its organisers tell you , the biggest international gathering ever held , and i hope they 're right . "
it is all whites , and the only blacks are servants " south african commentator i do not fancy elbowing my way through even more teeming masses than johannesburg has produced .
to be fair , though , while the organisers were talking of 65,000 delegates and assorted hangers-on like me , one i met last night put the figure - after some research - at about half that .
' most arcane ' summit but size is not everything .
i 'm sure some highly suggestive johannesburg advertiser has already announced as much - one imaginative builder 's merchant 's billboard near here offers for sale equipment to ensure " an erection that will withstand an enormous blow " .
this is also probably the most arcane summit in the entire course of human history .
a disgruntled campaigner told us the part of the negotiations that had left him rocking on his heels : paragraph 19 -lrb- e -rrb- of some document whose blushes we should spare , which he had found " probably the most unintelligible paragraph ever written by human beings " .
beat that .

this is the summit of superlatives .
it is , its organisers tell you , the biggest international gathering ever held , and i hope they 're right .
it is all whites , and the only blacks are servants south african commentator i do not fancy elbowing my way through even more teeming masses than johannesburg has produced .
to be fair , though , while the organisers were talking of 65,000 delegates and assorted hangers-on like me , one i met last night put the figure - after some research - at about half that .
' most arcane ' summit but size is not everything .
i 'm sure some highly suggestive johannesburg advertiser has already announced as much - one imaginative builder 's merchant 's billboard near here offers for sale equipment to ensure " an erection that will withstand an enormous blow " .
this is also probably the most arcane summit in the entire course of human history .
a disgruntled campaigner told us the part of the negotiations that had left him rocking on his heels : paragraph 19 -lrb- e -rrb- of some document whose blushes we should spare , which he had found " probably the most unintelligible paragraph ever written by human beings " .
beat that .
the superlative that sticks in my mind , though , is the description of sandton , the johannesburg suburb where the summit is being held , as " the richest square mile in africa " .
africa 's a biggish place , but i do n't doubt sandton 's claim .

she will answer questions about what she saw in the dubrava prison in kosovo in 1999 , where numerous prisoners were killed .
serb authorities claimed that nato planes bombed the prison , killing the inmates , but at the time jacky rowland reported that it was not clear how the prisoners had died .
a bbc correspondent in the hague , geraldine coughlan , says jacky rowland 's decision to give evidence is sure to heighten the debate on whether reporters should testify at such cases .
some argue it casts doubt on their objectivity , while others claim it is their duty as a citizen .
meanwhile , a group of international news organisations have asked the court in the hague to reconsider an order that a former reporter for the washington post must give evidence to the tribunal .
the media organisations said the court should recognise that journalists should not be compelled to give evidence except where absolutely essential .
genocide charges jacky rowland will be cross-examined by mr milosevic , who is defending himself against about 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide for the wars in kosovo , croatia and bosnia .
milosevic charges genocide crimes against humanity grave breaches of the geneva conventions violations of the laws or customs of war his trial resumed on monday after a month-long break .
the prosecution has only two weeks to wrap up its case on kosovo , where mr milosevic 's yugoslav forces fought ethnic albanian separatists in the 1998-1999 war .
hearings will then turn to the earlier wars in croatia and bosnia .
medical reports suggesting that mr milosevic is at risk of a heart attack could result in moves to slow down the pace of the trial .
role of journalists jacky rowland agreed to testify because she said she considers it her duty .
others , who have also testified at the court in the hague - such as a former bbc war correspondent , martin bell - claim journalists are no different from other professionals when it comes to witnessing a crime .
but some argue it casts doubt on their objectivity and could endanger their lives .
a retired washington post correspondent , jonathan randal , is the first journalist to refuse to give evidence at the tribunal .
on monday lawyers intervened on behalf of mr randal , asking the tribunal to outline procedures to protect journalists from being forced to give evidence except in essential circumstances .

she will answer questions about what she saw in the dubrava prison in kosovo in 1999 , where numerous prisoners were killed .
serb authorities claimed that nato planes bombed the prison , killing the inmates , but at the time jacky rowland reported that it was not clear how the prisoners had died .
jacky rowland was expelled from yugoslavia a bbc correspondent in the hague , geraldine coughlan , says jacky rowland 's decision to give evidence is sure to heighten the debate on whether reporters should testify at such cases .
some argue it casts doubt on their objectivity , while others claim it is their duty as a citizen .
meanwhile , a group of international news organisations have asked the court in the hague to reconsider an order that a former reporter for the washington post must give evidence to the tribunal .
the media organisations said the court should recognise that journalists should not be compelled to give evidence except where absolutely essential .
genocide charges jacky rowland will be cross-examined by mr milosevic , who is defending himself against about 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide for the wars in kosovo , croatia and bosnia .
milosevic charges genocide crimes against humanity grave breaches of the geneva conventions violations of the laws or customs of war his trial resumed on monday after a month-long break .
the prosecution has only two weeks to wrap up its case on kosovo , where mr milosevic 's yugoslav forces fought ethnic albanian separatists in the 1998-1999 war .
hearings will then turn to the earlier wars in croatia and bosnia .
medical reports suggesting that mr milosevic is at risk of a heart attack could result in moves to slow down the pace of the trial .
role of journalists jacky rowland agreed to testify because she said she considers it her duty .
others , who have also testified at the court in the hague - such as a former bbc war correspondent , martin bell - claim journalists are no different from other professionals when it comes to witnessing a crime .
but some argue it casts doubt on their objectivity and could endanger their lives .
a retired washington post correspondent , jonathan randal , is the first journalist to refuse to give evidence at the tribunal .
on monday lawyers intervened on behalf of mr randal , asking the tribunal to outline procedures to protect journalists from being forced to give evidence except in essential circumstances .
now five international media organisations have supported his stand , urging the tribunal " to recognize a qualified privilege for journalists not to be compelled to testify about their news gathering before this court unless certain conditions are met - namely that the information is absolutely essential to the case and that it can not be obtained by any other means " .
" forcing journalists to testify against their sources -lrb- confidential or otherwise -rrb- will make future sources more hesitant to talk to the press , particularly in war zones , " the news groups said in a statement .

computer science students in chandigarh , 248 kilometres -lrb- 154 miles -rrb- from delhi , have developed an interactive software program called deepti which can converse intelligently with people in natural language .
" the good thing about deepti is that it is suitable for the indian environment , " explained ritvik sahajpal , one of the students who developed the software .

the nuclear power generator is heavily in debt and is struggling to sort out its finances .
a deal with bnfl could provide it with additional fees .
the magnox reactors are the uk 's oldest atomic power plants and were left with bnfl when the rest of the nuclear generation business was privatised with the flotation of british energy .
a contract to run the plants could last until 2010 , when the reactors reach the end of their working life .
a deal is unlikely to solve the company 's problems but would allow a breathing space .
there has been growing speculation about how british energy will deal with its financial problems with newspaper reports suggesting the government would pay off some of the debt or even renationalise the business .
market distortions in a statement to the london stock exchange on tuesday , british energy said that it was continuing its discussions with bnfl on a wide range of issues .
these included " fuel service arrangements , new nuclear build , the possible operation of magnox plant and transportation " .
the company said that it was continuing to inform the government about the market environment and the effect on the business of " market distortions including climate change levy exemption and business rates " .
british energy has been arguing for a reduction in the business rates it pays on its power stations to bring them into line with its non-nuclear competitors .
the company also wants to be excluded from the climate change levy .
wholesale changes ?
energy minister brian wilson hinted on monday that the wholesale electricity market could be changed to help british energy .
he said that the company had been badly hit by last year 's introduction of new wholesale energy trading arrangements -lrb- neta -rrb- .
this led to increased competition and lower wholesale electricity prices .
unlike other electricity generators , british energy does not have a retail business to offset these lower prices .
mr wilson said the government would look at " the impact of neta on the viability of generators " .
british energy operates eight power plants in the uk , and runs other nuclear power operations in the us .
on tuesday morning the company 's share price rose 16.5 % to 68.75 pence .
on friday it hit a low of 59p after news that it had shut a second reactor at its dungeness power station for maintenance .

the rats given the cell transplants showed " significant improvements " in their ability to function two weeks after a stroke compared to those who did not have a transplant .
stroke experts say the work could one day lead to better treatment for patients .
researchers from oakland university in rochester , michigan , us gave rats adult human stromal cells - mature cells from bone marrow which have already been used in cancer patients . "
this research uses a new form of potential cells so it is still to early to know whether they will work " stroke association spokesman dr michael chopp of oakland university , who led the research , published in the journal neurology , said : " these are smart cells that selectively migrate to the site of injury and become little factories producing an array of helpful molecules to repair the tissue .
" we believe this therapy shows promise in treating stroke , parkinson 's disease , spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury . "
improvements in the study , bone marrow cells were taken from three healthy human donors .
researchers then induced strokes in the rats .
some were then given the cells intravenously one day afterwards .
other rats treated with fibroblast cells , which make up connective tissues , such as cartilage and ligaments .
a third group was given no treatment at all .
the rats were tested on their motor and sensory abilities and their reflexes before and after their strokes .
in tests of their sensory abilities 14 days after the stroke , rats treated with stromal cells completed the test 60 % faster than the non-treated rats .
an examination of their brains showed they had a 30 % improvement in neurological scores for movement and consciousness compared to rats who had received no treatment .
they had more of the necessary growth factors needed to stimulate brain cells to develop .
there was also less cell death in the area around the stroke .
treatment window researchers now hope to test the treatment in humans to check it is safe .
in an editorial in neurology , dr thomas kent , from the university of texas medical branch in galveston , said the treatment should give doctors longer in which to treat stroke patients .
he said : " it 's very difficult to treat people with a stroke within a narrow time window .
" many people still do n't recognize the symptoms of stroke and get to an emergency room quickly enough for treatment .
" if this new treatment is effective , it could expand the treatment window by several hours or even longer . "
acceptance a spokesman for the stroke association told bbc news online : " in the last few years , neurologists have discovered that the brain can accept new cells and make them its own , in the same way the body can adopt a new heart of kidney .
" the technique has already been used , with some success , in people suffering from parkinson 's disease as well as a few stroke patients in the united states .
" this research uses a new form of potential cells so it is still to early to know whether they will work .
" ideally what is needed are immature cells which have not yet decided what role they will play . "
he added : " if these transplants work there could be huge benefits for the 300,000 people who are currently living with devastating affects of stroke . "

the rats given the cell transplants showed " significant improvements " in their ability to function two weeks after a stroke compared to those who did not have a transplant .
stroke experts say the work could one day lead to better treatment for patients .
researchers from oakland university in rochester , michigan , us gave rats adult human stromal cells - mature cells from bone marrow which have already been used in cancer patients .
this research uses a new form of potential cells so it is still to early to know whether they will work stroke association spokesman dr michael chopp of oakland university , who led the research , published in the journal neurology , said : " these are smart cells that selectively migrate to the site of injury and become little factories producing an array of helpful molecules to repair the tissue .
" we believe this therapy shows promise in treating stroke , parkinson 's disease , spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury . "
improvements in the study , bone marrow cells were taken from three healthy human donors .
researchers then induced strokes in the rats .
some were then given the cells intravenously one day afterwards .
other rats treated with fibroblast cells , which make up connective tissues , such as cartilage and ligaments .
a third group was given no treatment at all .
the rats were tested on their motor and sensory abilities and their reflexes before and after their strokes .
in tests of their sensory abilities 14 days after the stroke , rats treated with stromal cells completed the test 60 % faster than the non-treated rats .
an examination of their brains showed they had a 30 % improvement in neurological scores for movement and consciousness compared to rats who had received no treatment .
they had more of the necessary growth factors needed to stimulate brain cells to develop .
there was also less cell death in the area around the stroke .
treatment window researchers now hope to test the treatment in humans to check it is safe .
in an editorial in neurology , dr thomas kent , from the university of texas medical branch in galveston , said the treatment should give doctors longer in which to treat stroke patients .
he said : " it 's very difficult to treat people with a stroke within a narrow time window .
" many people still do n't recognize the symptoms of stroke and get to an emergency room quickly enough for treatment .
" if this new treatment is effective , it could expand the treatment window by several hours or even longer . "
acceptance a spokesman for the stroke association told bbc news online : " in the last few years , neurologists have discovered that the brain can accept new cells and make them its own , in the same way the body can adopt a new heart of kidney .
" the technique has already been used , with some success , in people suffering from parkinson 's disease as well as a few stroke patients in the united states .
" this research uses a new form of potential cells so it is still to early to know whether they will work .
" ideally what is needed are immature cells which have not yet decided what role they will play . "
he added : " if these transplants work there could be huge benefits for the 300,000 people who are currently living with devastating affects of stroke . "

they have agreed to work to strengthen the application of environmental laws wherever they exist .
they believe effective laws do exist in most countries , but that they are hard to enforce in practice .
the participants included judges from the united states , brazil and russia .
significantly , they were unanimous in endorsing the principles , some of which clearly run counter to the thinking of the administration in washington .
the legal initiative is the work of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
' guardian of law ' the high court and supreme court judges met in a symposium held here last week , co-hosted by justice arthur chaskalson , south africa 's chief justice .
they agreed a statement , the johannesburg principles on the role of law and sustainable development .
this is an issue affecting billions of people who are effectively being denied their rights klaus toepfer executive director of unep one key passage states : " we emphasise that the fragile state of the global environment requires the judiciary , as the guardian of the rule of law , to boldly and fearlessly implement and enforce applicable international and national laws which ... will assist in alleviating poverty and sustaining an enduring civilisation . "
the principles also " recognise that the people most affected by environmental degradation are the poor " .
they say " the inequality between powerful and weak nations " places a greater responsibility on the rich to protect the environment .
justice chaskalson said : " the rule of law is the basis for a stable country and ultimately stable world .
i am personally committed to realising and taking forward these historic principles . "
need for enforcement " the field of law has , in many ways , been the poor relation in the world-wide effort to deliver a cleaner , healthier and ultimately fairer world , " said dr klaus toepfer , executive director of unep .
us judges endorsed principles which run counter to washington thinking " we have over 500 international and regional agreements , treaties and deals covering everything from the protection of the ozone layer to the conservation of the oceans and seas .
" almost all ... countries have national environmental laws too .
but unless these are enforced , then they are little more than symbols , tokens , paper tigers .
" this is an issue affecting billions of people who are effectively being denied their rights , and one of not only national but regional and global concern .
" what happens in one part of the world can affect another part of the globe - toxic pollutants from asia , europe and north america contaminating the arctic , the greenhouse gases of the industrialised regions triggering droughts , or the melting of glaciers in the less industrialised ones . "
weaknesses the project aims to develop the training of judges and lawyers , and to improve people 's access to the courts , the legal system and to information .
unep believes weaknesses in many countries ' legal systems are helping to undermine efforts to prevent pollution and secure compliance with agreements on issues like hazardous wastes and the trade in endangered species .
it says these weaknesses are especially acute in many developing countries and nations of the former soviet union , where lack of resources and awareness , and problems with turning international treaties into national law , make it harder for cases to reach or succeed in the courts .

they have agreed to work to strengthen the application of environmental laws wherever they exist .
they believe effective laws do exist in most countries , but that they are hard to enforce in practice .
the participants included judges from the united states , brazil and russia .
significantly , they were unanimous in endorsing the principles , some of which clearly run counter to the thinking of the administration in washington .
the legal initiative is the work of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
' guardian of law ' the high court and supreme court judges met in a symposium held here last week , co-hosted by justice arthur chaskalson , south africa 's chief justice .
they agreed a statement , the johannesburg principles on the role of law and sustainable development . "
this is an issue affecting billions of people who are effectively being denied their rights " klaus toepfer executive director of unep one key passage states : " we emphasise that the fragile state of the global environment requires the judiciary , as the guardian of the rule of law , to boldly and fearlessly implement and enforce applicable international and national laws which ... will assist in alleviating poverty and sustaining an enduring civilisation . "
the principles also " recognise that the people most affected by environmental degradation are the poor " .
they say " the inequality between powerful and weak nations " places a greater responsibility on the rich to protect the environment .
justice chaskalson said : " the rule of law is the basis for a stable country and ultimately stable world .
i am personally committed to realising and taking forward these historic principles . "
need for enforcement " the field of law has , in many ways , been the poor relation in the world-wide effort to deliver a cleaner , healthier and ultimately fairer world , " said dr klaus toepfer , executive director of unep .
" we have over 500 international and regional agreements , treaties and deals covering everything from the protection of the ozone layer to the conservation of the oceans and seas .
" almost all ... countries have national environmental laws too .
but unless these are enforced , then they are little more than symbols , tokens , paper tigers .
" this is an issue affecting billions of people who are effectively being denied their rights , and one of not only national but regional and global concern .
" what happens in one part of the world can affect another part of the globe - toxic pollutants from asia , europe and north america contaminating the arctic , the greenhouse gases of the industrialised regions triggering droughts , or the melting of glaciers in the less industrialised ones . "
weaknesses the project aims to develop the training of judges and lawyers , and to improve people 's access to the courts , the legal system and to information .
unep believes weaknesses in many countries ' legal systems are helping to undermine efforts to prevent pollution and secure compliance with agreements on issues like hazardous wastes and the trade in endangered species .
it says these weaknesses are especially acute in many developing countries and nations of the former soviet union , where lack of resources and awareness , and problems with turning international treaties into national law , make it harder for cases to reach or succeed in the courts .

no clear offence was given , but reports have suggested that ryder angered bbc bosses by endorsing a series of companies in a celebrity magazine , following his recent marriage to former hear 'say singer kym marsh .
the couple , who are thought to have been paid £ 300,000 by the magazine for coverage of their wedding , reportedly plugged a menswear shop and a hotel in the feature .
however , eastenders cast members are not allowed to endorse products without permission because the bbc is banned from publicising commercial interests .
an eastenders spokesperson said that £ 20,000 - one fifth of ryder 's annual salary on the show - if enforced , would be the highest fine ever given to one of their cast members .
ryder is leaving albert square in november after four years on the show .
meanwhile co-star jessie wallace , who stars as kat slater , has been suspended from eastenders for two months , also over an apparent breach of contract .
the suspension is thought to be disciplinary , following a string of alleged incidents which have seen the 30-year-old actress hitting the headlines .
wallace was reportedly involved in a scuffle with fellow eastenders actress hannah waterman , who plays laura beale , at a party in march , and was accused of attacking a cab driver last christmas .
her suspension will begin in january next year .
wallace is not the first member of the slater family to take time out from the soap .
actress elaine lordan , who stars as her older sister lynne , took three months off last year following a drink-driving charge .
michelle ryan , who plays kat 's daughter zoe , is on leave after doctors ordered her to take a break from the show .
