full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace . the g8 summit of the world 's richest industrial countries ended in kananaskis , canada , on thursday with agreements on extending full membership and billions in non-proliferation aid to russia and providing modest debt forgiveness for africa 's poorest countries .
however , a plan by united states president george w. bush to call for the ouster of palestinian president yasser arafat met with major resistance from his g8 partners .
middle east debate sidelined on the eve of the conference on monday , bush announced his new plan for peace in the middle east and sought to make it the agenda leader at the annual summit .
however , canadian prime minister jean chretian held firmly to the course he charted and stuck , for the most part , with granting russia membership and approving an aid package for africa , a continent whose development is hampered by rampant disease and abject poverty .
schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .
" that is a truism of democracy . "
at the same time , he said the building of democratic structures in the palestinian-controlled areas is more important than individual leaders .
still , he said doubts about arafat 's ability to contain terrorism are justified .
new aid for africa at the secluded rocky mountain resort kananaskis , the leaders signed off on an a debt-relief package for africa .
the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .
but they failed to firmly earmark for africa half of the $ 12 billion a year in new aid pledged at the march meeting .
instead , the g8 's closing statement expressed what many observers predicted would be the case : aid decisions will be made by the individual g8 members rather than the group of eight itself .
the u.n. has estimated that at least $ 25 billion is necessary to meet international development goals for africa , and development aid organizations said the g8 was merely providing " non-binding declarations of intent " to give more aid .
" i believe we must help this continent and the people living there .
that has been made clear here , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" for instance , it 's clear that we 're in the process of giving 50 percent of state development aid to africa , " he said .
that aid comes with the provision that the continent adopts policies to strengthen democracy , stability and free markets .
and , despite lobbying from britain and canada , g8 members welcomed , but did not commit themselves to the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , the partnership for development proposed by african states which pledges corruption-free governments in return for aid .
un general secretary-general kofi annan and leaders from five african countries had flown into the meeting under observer status to present the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.06.2002 agent provocateur schlingensief feels the heat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firestarter controversial performer christoph schlingensief has attracted the attention of federal prosecutors with his “ aktion 18 , ” a mock-support campaign of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . provocation is his game .
and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .
though the artist is under heavy surveilance , it is unlikely schlingensief will run out of ammo any time soon .
the aktion 18 campaign is expected to continue fueling the flames of controversy in cologne on friday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links aktion18 website free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- website 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2002 deutsche bank announces further layoffs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank wants to slim down and push its profits up .
deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .
that 's in addition to the 9,200 layoffs already announced , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees will be looking for work . at the end of 2001 , some 95,000 people were employed by deutsche bank , by the end of next year , that number will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced on thursday evening that it will continue paring its workforce as part of an aggressive cost-control program spearheaded by new chairman josef ackermann , who officially took over the reigns in late may .
he wants deutsche bank to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of 2003 .
the corporate and investment banking division will be hit hardest , where approximately 1,970 employees will lose their jobs , more than half from the americas , 315 in the uk , 310 in the asia / pacific region and 320 in continental europe .
the other 1,800 layoffs , in the private client and asset management divisions , will be lost in germany and other parts of europe .
" in the face of continued bad performance of the markets , " a bank spokesman told reporters , if the bank wants to meet its savings targets " there is no other choice . "
leaner and meaner josef ackermann took over the top spot at deutsche bank with specific goals in mind : lower costs , higher efficiency and with it , higher shareholder value .
he wants to create a leaner , meaner bank , one where the emphasis is on performance and share values , even it that means sacrificing some in the client area .
ackermann finds it unacceptable that when it comes to market capitalization , deutsche bank is only in 21st place world wide .
he says the bank should be in the top five globally and he appears not afraid to make sacrifices to get it there .
one goal is to drive the bank 's market value higher , to ensure it " can play a role in european or global consolidation that will take place in the foreseeable future , " ackermann said .
the bank ’ s share prices have rebounded from their lows from last september , when they were trading at just over 43 euro -lrb- $ 42.91 -rrb- .
for the last few months , a share has traded for around 70 euro -lrb- $ 69.85 -rrb- , still well under its peak of more than 100 euro -lrb- $ 99.79 -rrb- .

deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .
that 's in addition to the 9,200 layoffs already announced , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees will be looking for work . at the end of 2001 , some 95,000 people were employed by deutsche bank , by the end of next year , that number will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced on thursday evening that it will continue paring its workforce as part of an aggressive cost-control program spearheaded by new chairman josef ackermann , who officially took over the reigns in late may .
he wants deutsche bank to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of 2003 .
the corporate and investment banking division will be hit hardest , where approximately 1,970 employees will lose their jobs , more than half from the americas , 315 in the uk , 310 in the asia / pacific region and 320 in continental europe .
the other 1,800 layoffs , in the private client and asset management divisions , will be lost in germany and other parts of europe .
" in the face of continued bad performance of the markets , " a bank spokesman told reporters , if the bank wants to meet its savings targets " there is no other choice . "
leaner and meaner josef ackermann took over the top spot at deutsche bank with specific goals in mind : lower costs , higher efficiency and with it , higher shareholder value .
he wants to create a leaner , meaner bank , one where the emphasis is on performance and share values , even it that means sacrificing some in the client area .
ackermann finds it unacceptable that when it comes to market capitalization , deutsche bank is only in 21st place world wide .
he says the bank should be in the top five globally and he appears not afraid to make sacrifices to get it there .
one goal is to drive the bank 's market value higher , to ensure it " can play a role in european or global consolidation that will take place in the foreseeable future , " ackermann said .
the bank ’ s share prices have rebounded from their lows from last september , when they were trading at just over 43 euro -lrb- $ 42.91 -rrb- .
for the last few months , a share has traded for around 70 euro -lrb- $ 69.85 -rrb- , still well under its peak of more than 100 euro -lrb- $ 99.79 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.06.2002 agent provocateur schlingensief feels the heat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firestarter controversial performer christoph schlingensief has attracted the attention of federal prosecutors with his “ aktion 18 , ” a mock-support campaign of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . provocation is his game .
and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .
though the artist is under heavy surveilance , it is unlikely schlingensief will run out of ammo any time soon .

but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.06.2002 agent provocateur schlingensief feels the heat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firestarter controversial performer christoph schlingensief has attracted the attention of federal prosecutors with his “ aktion 18 , ” a mock-support campaign of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . provocation is his game .
and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .
though the artist is under heavy surveilance , it is unlikely schlingensief will run out of ammo any time soon .

but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .
and by that time scharping and his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , might already be gone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace . the g8 summit of the world 's richest industrial countries ended in kananaskis , canada , on thursday with agreements on extending full membership and billions in non-proliferation aid to russia and providing modest debt forgiveness for africa 's poorest countries .
however , a plan by united states president george w. bush to call for the ouster of palestinian president yasser arafat met with major resistance from his g8 partners .
middle east debate sidelined on the eve of the conference on monday , bush announced his new plan for peace in the middle east and sought to make it the agenda leader at the annual summit .
however , canadian prime minister jean chretian held firmly to the course he charted and stuck , for the most part , with granting russia membership and approving an aid package for africa , a continent whose development is hampered by rampant disease and abject poverty .
schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .
" that is a truism of democracy . "
at the same time , he said the building of democratic structures in the palestinian-controlled areas is more important than individual leaders .
still , he said doubts about arafat 's ability to contain terrorism are justified .

the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .
but they failed to firmly earmark for africa half of the $ 12 billion a year in new aid pledged at the march meeting .
instead , the g8 's closing statement expressed what many observers predicted would be the case : aid decisions will be made by the individual g8 members rather than the group of eight itself .
the u.n. has estimated that at least $ 25 billion is necessary to meet international development goals for africa , and development aid organizations said the g8 was merely providing " non-binding declarations of intent " to give more aid .
" i believe we must help this continent and the people living there .
that has been made clear here , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" for instance , it 's clear that we 're in the process of giving 50 percent of state development aid to africa , " he said .
that aid comes with the provision that the continent adopts policies to strengthen democracy , stability and free markets .
and , despite lobbying from britain and canada , g8 members welcomed , but did not commit themselves to the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , the partnership for development proposed by african states which pledges corruption-free governments in return for aid .
un general secretary-general kofi annan and leaders from five african countries had flown into the meeting under observer status to present the plan .

deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .
that 's in addition to the 9,200 layoffs already announced , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees will be looking for work . at the end of 2001 , some 95,000 people were employed by deutsche bank , by the end of next year , that number will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced on thursday evening that it will continue paring its workforce as part of an aggressive cost-control program spearheaded by new chairman josef ackermann , who officially took over the reigns in late may .
he wants deutsche bank to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of 2003 .
the corporate and investment banking division will be hit hardest , where approximately 1,970 employees will lose their jobs , more than half from the americas , 315 in the uk , 310 in the asia / pacific region and 320 in continental europe .
the other 1,800 layoffs , in the private client and asset management divisions , will be lost in germany and other parts of europe .
" in the face of continued bad performance of the markets , " a bank spokesman told reporters , if the bank wants to meet its savings targets " there is no other choice . "
leaner and meaner josef ackermann took over the top spot at deutsche bank with specific goals in mind : lower costs , higher efficiency and with it , higher shareholder value .
he wants to create a leaner , meaner bank , one where the emphasis is on performance and share values , even it that means sacrificing some in the client area .
ackermann finds it unacceptable that when it comes to market capitalization , deutsche bank is only in 21st place world wide .
he says the bank should be in the top five globally and he appears not afraid to make sacrifices to get it there .
one goal is to drive the bank 's market value higher , to ensure it " can play a role in european or global consolidation that will take place in the foreseeable future , " ackermann said .
the bank ’ s share prices have rebounded from their lows from last september , when they were trading at just over 43 euro -lrb- $ 42.91 -rrb- .
for the last few months , a share has traded for around 70 euro -lrb- $ 69.85 -rrb- , still well under its peak of more than 100 euro -lrb- $ 99.79 -rrb- .
in his continuing efforts to slim down , ackermann is also pressing ahead with plans to sell its considerable shareholdings in some of germany 's corporate giants , including daimlerchrysler , continental and axel springer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top banks urged to refrain from compulsory lay-offs trade unions and works councils are working to avoid a wave of compulsory redundancies in germany 's banking sector , as the big four german banks prepare to cut a total of 30,000 jobs , 17,000 of them in germany .

full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace . the g8 summit of the world 's richest industrial countries ended in kananaskis , canada , on thursday with agreements on extending full membership and billions in non-proliferation aid to russia and providing modest debt forgiveness for africa 's poorest countries .
however , a plan by united states president george w. bush to call for the ouster of palestinian president yasser arafat met with major resistance from his g8 partners .
middle east debate sidelined on the eve of the conference on monday , bush announced his new plan for peace in the middle east and sought to make it the agenda leader at the annual summit .
however , canadian prime minister jean chretian held firmly to the course he charted and stuck , for the most part , with granting russia membership and approving an aid package for africa , a continent whose development is hampered by rampant disease and abject poverty .
schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .
" that is a truism of democracy . "
at the same time , he said the building of democratic structures in the palestinian-controlled areas is more important than individual leaders .
still , he said doubts about arafat 's ability to contain terrorism are justified .
new aid for africa at the secluded rocky mountain resort kananaskis , the leaders signed off on an a debt-relief package for africa .
the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .
but they failed to firmly earmark for africa half of the $ 12 billion a year in new aid pledged at the march meeting .
instead , the g8 's closing statement expressed what many observers predicted would be the case : aid decisions will be made by the individual g8 members rather than the group of eight itself .
the u.n. has estimated that at least $ 25 billion is necessary to meet international development goals for africa , and development aid organizations said the g8 was merely providing " non-binding declarations of intent " to give more aid .
" i believe we must help this continent and the people living there .
that has been made clear here , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" for instance , it 's clear that we 're in the process of giving 50 percent of state development aid to africa , " he said .
that aid comes with the provision that the continent adopts policies to strengthen democracy , stability and free markets .
and , despite lobbying from britain and canada , g8 members welcomed , but did not commit themselves to the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , the partnership for development proposed by african states which pledges corruption-free governments in return for aid .
un general secretary-general kofi annan and leaders from five african countries had flown into the meeting under observer status to present the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.06.2002 putting germany 's armed forces in private hands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying for all those deployments faced with sinking funding and increasing demands , germany 's armed forces are turning to the private sector for a bailout .
but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.06.2002 putting germany 's armed forces in private hands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying for all those deployments faced with sinking funding and increasing demands , germany 's armed forces are turning to the private sector for a bailout .
but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .
and by that time scharping and his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , might already be gone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .
that 's in addition to the 9,200 layoffs already announced , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees will be looking for work . at the end of 2001 , some 95,000 people were employed by deutsche bank , by the end of next year , that number will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced on thursday evening that it will continue paring its workforce as part of an aggressive cost-control program spearheaded by new chairman josef ackermann , who officially took over the reigns in late may .
he wants deutsche bank to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of 2003 .
the corporate and investment banking division will be hit hardest , where approximately 1,970 employees will lose their jobs , more than half from the americas , 315 in the uk , 310 in the asia / pacific region and 320 in continental europe .
the other 1,800 layoffs , in the private client and asset management divisions , will be lost in germany and other parts of europe .
" in the face of continued bad performance of the markets , " a bank spokesman told reporters , if the bank wants to meet its savings targets " there is no other choice . "
leaner and meaner josef ackermann took over the top spot at deutsche bank with specific goals in mind : lower costs , higher efficiency and with it , higher shareholder value .
he wants to create a leaner , meaner bank , one where the emphasis is on performance and share values , even it that means sacrificing some in the client area .
ackermann finds it unacceptable that when it comes to market capitalization , deutsche bank is only in 21st place world wide .
he says the bank should be in the top five globally and he appears not afraid to make sacrifices to get it there .
one goal is to drive the bank 's market value higher , to ensure it " can play a role in european or global consolidation that will take place in the foreseeable future , " ackermann said .
the bank ’ s share prices have rebounded from their lows from last september , when they were trading at just over 43 euro -lrb- $ 42.91 -rrb- .
for the last few months , a share has traded for around 70 euro -lrb- $ 69.85 -rrb- , still well under its peak of more than 100 euro -lrb- $ 99.79 -rrb- .

and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .
though the artist is under heavy surveilance , it is unlikely schlingensief will run out of ammo any time soon .

and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .
though the artist is under heavy surveilance , it is unlikely schlingensief will run out of ammo any time soon .

but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.06.2002 agent provocateur schlingensief feels the heat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firestarter controversial performer christoph schlingensief has attracted the attention of federal prosecutors with his “ aktion 18 , ” a mock-support campaign of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . provocation is his game .
and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .

and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .

and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”

but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .

but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .
and by that time scharping and his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , might already be gone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace . the g8 summit of the world 's richest industrial countries ended in kananaskis , canada , on thursday with agreements on extending full membership and billions in non-proliferation aid to russia and providing modest debt forgiveness for africa 's poorest countries .
however , a plan by united states president george w. bush to call for the ouster of palestinian president yasser arafat met with major resistance from his g8 partners .
middle east debate sidelined on the eve of the conference on monday , bush announced his new plan for peace in the middle east and sought to make it the agenda leader at the annual summit .
however , canadian prime minister jean chretian held firmly to the course he charted and stuck , for the most part , with granting russia membership and approving an aid package for africa , a continent whose development is hampered by rampant disease and abject poverty .
schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .
" that is a truism of democracy . "
at the same time , he said the building of democratic structures in the palestinian-controlled areas is more important than individual leaders .
still , he said doubts about arafat 's ability to contain terrorism are justified .
new aid for africa at the secluded rocky mountain resort kananaskis , the leaders signed off on an a debt-relief package for africa .
the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .
but they failed to firmly earmark for africa half of the $ 12 billion a year in new aid pledged at the march meeting .
instead , the g8 's closing statement expressed what many observers predicted would be the case : aid decisions will be made by the individual g8 members rather than the group of eight itself .
the u.n. has estimated that at least $ 25 billion is necessary to meet international development goals for africa , and development aid organizations said the g8 was merely providing " non-binding declarations of intent " to give more aid .
" i believe we must help this continent and the people living there .
that has been made clear here , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" for instance , it 's clear that we 're in the process of giving 50 percent of state development aid to africa , " he said .
that aid comes with the provision that the continent adopts policies to strengthen democracy , stability and free markets .
and , despite lobbying from britain and canada , g8 members welcomed , but did not commit themselves to the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , the partnership for development proposed by african states which pledges corruption-free governments in return for aid .
un general secretary-general kofi annan and leaders from five african countries had flown into the meeting under observer status to present the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.06.2002 agent provocateur schlingensief feels the heat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firestarter controversial performer christoph schlingensief has attracted the attention of federal prosecutors with his “ aktion 18 , ” a mock-support campaign of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . provocation is his game .
and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .
though the artist is under heavy surveilance , it is unlikely schlingensief will run out of ammo any time soon .

full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace . the g8 summit of the world 's richest industrial countries ended in kananaskis , canada , on thursday with agreements on extending full membership and billions in non-proliferation aid to russia and providing modest debt forgiveness for africa 's poorest countries .
however , a plan by united states president george w. bush to call for the ouster of palestinian president yasser arafat met with major resistance from his g8 partners .
middle east debate sidelined on the eve of the conference on monday , bush announced his new plan for peace in the middle east and sought to make it the agenda leader at the annual summit .
however , canadian prime minister jean chretian held firmly to the course he charted and stuck , for the most part , with granting russia membership and approving an aid package for africa , a continent whose development is hampered by rampant disease and abject poverty .
schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .
" that is a truism of democracy . "
at the same time , he said the building of democratic structures in the palestinian-controlled areas is more important than individual leaders .
still , he said doubts about arafat 's ability to contain terrorism are justified .
new aid for africa at the secluded rocky mountain resort kananaskis , the leaders signed off on an a debt-relief package for africa .
the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .
but they failed to firmly earmark for africa half of the $ 12 billion a year in new aid pledged at the march meeting .
instead , the g8 's closing statement expressed what many observers predicted would be the case : aid decisions will be made by the individual g8 members rather than the group of eight itself .
the u.n. has estimated that at least $ 25 billion is necessary to meet international development goals for africa , and development aid organizations said the g8 was merely providing " non-binding declarations of intent " to give more aid .
" i believe we must help this continent and the people living there .
that has been made clear here , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" for instance , it 's clear that we 're in the process of giving 50 percent of state development aid to africa , " he said .
that aid comes with the provision that the continent adopts policies to strengthen democracy , stability and free markets .
and , despite lobbying from britain and canada , g8 members welcomed , but did not commit themselves to the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , the partnership for development proposed by african states which pledges corruption-free governments in return for aid .
un general secretary-general kofi annan and leaders from five african countries had flown into the meeting under observer status to present the plan .
in the end , africa stood in the shadow of russia , which walked away from the summit with aid pledges of $ 20 billion in support for the safeguarding and decommissioning nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the g8 with love : full membership for russia the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.06.2002 agent provocateur schlingensief feels the heat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firestarter controversial performer christoph schlingensief has attracted the attention of federal prosecutors with his “ aktion 18 , ” a mock-support campaign of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . provocation is his game .
and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .
though the artist is under heavy surveilance , it is unlikely schlingensief will run out of ammo any time soon .

and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .

but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .
and by that time scharping and his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , might already be gone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .
and by that time scharping and his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , might already be gone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace . the g8 summit of the world 's richest industrial countries ended in kananaskis , canada , on thursday with agreements on extending full membership and billions in non-proliferation aid to russia and providing modest debt forgiveness for africa 's poorest countries .
however , a plan by united states president george w. bush to call for the ouster of palestinian president yasser arafat met with major resistance from his g8 partners .
middle east debate sidelined on the eve of the conference on monday , bush announced his new plan for peace in the middle east and sought to make it the agenda leader at the annual summit .
however , canadian prime minister jean chretian held firmly to the course he charted and stuck , for the most part , with granting russia membership and approving an aid package for africa , a continent whose development is hampered by rampant disease and abject poverty .
schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .
" that is a truism of democracy . "
at the same time , he said the building of democratic structures in the palestinian-controlled areas is more important than individual leaders .
still , he said doubts about arafat 's ability to contain terrorism are justified .
new aid for africa at the secluded rocky mountain resort kananaskis , the leaders signed off on an a debt-relief package for africa .
the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .
but they failed to firmly earmark for africa half of the $ 12 billion a year in new aid pledged at the march meeting .
instead , the g8 's closing statement expressed what many observers predicted would be the case : aid decisions will be made by the individual g8 members rather than the group of eight itself .
the u.n. has estimated that at least $ 25 billion is necessary to meet international development goals for africa , and development aid organizations said the g8 was merely providing " non-binding declarations of intent " to give more aid .
" i believe we must help this continent and the people living there .
that has been made clear here , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" for instance , it 's clear that we 're in the process of giving 50 percent of state development aid to africa , " he said .
that aid comes with the provision that the continent adopts policies to strengthen democracy , stability and free markets .
and , despite lobbying from britain and canada , g8 members welcomed , but did not commit themselves to the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , the partnership for development proposed by african states which pledges corruption-free governments in return for aid .
un general secretary-general kofi annan and leaders from five african countries had flown into the meeting under observer status to present the plan .

but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2002 deutsche bank announces further layoffs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank wants to slim down and push its profits up .
deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .
that 's in addition to the 9,200 layoffs already announced , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees will be looking for work . at the end of 2001 , some 95,000 people were employed by deutsche bank , by the end of next year , that number will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced on thursday evening that it will continue paring its workforce as part of an aggressive cost-control program spearheaded by new chairman josef ackermann , who officially took over the reigns in late may .
he wants deutsche bank to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of 2003 .
the corporate and investment banking division will be hit hardest , where approximately 1,970 employees will lose their jobs , more than half from the americas , 315 in the uk , 310 in the asia / pacific region and 320 in continental europe .
the other 1,800 layoffs , in the private client and asset management divisions , will be lost in germany and other parts of europe .
" in the face of continued bad performance of the markets , " a bank spokesman told reporters , if the bank wants to meet its savings targets " there is no other choice . "
leaner and meaner josef ackermann took over the top spot at deutsche bank with specific goals in mind : lower costs , higher efficiency and with it , higher shareholder value .
he wants to create a leaner , meaner bank , one where the emphasis is on performance and share values , even it that means sacrificing some in the client area .

but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .
and by that time scharping and his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , might already be gone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2002 deutsche bank announces further layoffs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank wants to slim down and push its profits up .
deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .
that 's in addition to the 9,200 layoffs already announced , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees will be looking for work . at the end of 2001 , some 95,000 people were employed by deutsche bank , by the end of next year , that number will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced on thursday evening that it will continue paring its workforce as part of an aggressive cost-control program spearheaded by new chairman josef ackermann , who officially took over the reigns in late may .
he wants deutsche bank to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of 2003 .
the corporate and investment banking division will be hit hardest , where approximately 1,970 employees will lose their jobs , more than half from the americas , 315 in the uk , 310 in the asia / pacific region and 320 in continental europe .
the other 1,800 layoffs , in the private client and asset management divisions , will be lost in germany and other parts of europe .
" in the face of continued bad performance of the markets , " a bank spokesman told reporters , if the bank wants to meet its savings targets " there is no other choice . "
leaner and meaner josef ackermann took over the top spot at deutsche bank with specific goals in mind : lower costs , higher efficiency and with it , higher shareholder value .
he wants to create a leaner , meaner bank , one where the emphasis is on performance and share values , even it that means sacrificing some in the client area .
ackermann finds it unacceptable that when it comes to market capitalization , deutsche bank is only in 21st place world wide .
he says the bank should be in the top five globally and he appears not afraid to make sacrifices to get it there .
one goal is to drive the bank 's market value higher , to ensure it " can play a role in european or global consolidation that will take place in the foreseeable future , " ackermann said .
the bank ’ s share prices have rebounded from their lows from last september , when they were trading at just over 43 euro -lrb- $ 42.91 -rrb- .
for the last few months , a share has traded for around 70 euro -lrb- $ 69.85 -rrb- , still well under its peak of more than 100 euro -lrb- $ 99.79 -rrb- .

and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .
though the artist is under heavy surveilance , it is unlikely schlingensief will run out of ammo any time soon .

full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace . the g8 summit of the world 's richest industrial countries ended in kananaskis , canada , on thursday with agreements on extending full membership and billions in non-proliferation aid to russia and providing modest debt forgiveness for africa 's poorest countries .
however , a plan by united states president george w. bush to call for the ouster of palestinian president yasser arafat met with major resistance from his g8 partners .
middle east debate sidelined on the eve of the conference on monday , bush announced his new plan for peace in the middle east and sought to make it the agenda leader at the annual summit .
however , canadian prime minister jean chretian held firmly to the course he charted and stuck , for the most part , with granting russia membership and approving an aid package for africa , a continent whose development is hampered by rampant disease and abject poverty .
schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .
" that is a truism of democracy . "
at the same time , he said the building of democratic structures in the palestinian-controlled areas is more important than individual leaders .
still , he said doubts about arafat 's ability to contain terrorism are justified .
new aid for africa at the secluded rocky mountain resort kananaskis , the leaders signed off on an a debt-relief package for africa .
the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .
but they failed to firmly earmark for africa half of the $ 12 billion a year in new aid pledged at the march meeting .
instead , the g8 's closing statement expressed what many observers predicted would be the case : aid decisions will be made by the individual g8 members rather than the group of eight itself .
the u.n. has estimated that at least $ 25 billion is necessary to meet international development goals for africa , and development aid organizations said the g8 was merely providing " non-binding declarations of intent " to give more aid .
" i believe we must help this continent and the people living there .
that has been made clear here , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" for instance , it 's clear that we 're in the process of giving 50 percent of state development aid to africa , " he said .
that aid comes with the provision that the continent adopts policies to strengthen democracy , stability and free markets .
and , despite lobbying from britain and canada , g8 members welcomed , but did not commit themselves to the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , the partnership for development proposed by african states which pledges corruption-free governments in return for aid .
un general secretary-general kofi annan and leaders from five african countries had flown into the meeting under observer status to present the plan .
in the end , africa stood in the shadow of russia , which walked away from the summit with aid pledges of $ 20 billion in support for the safeguarding and decommissioning nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the g8 with love : full membership for russia the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .

schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .
" that is a truism of democracy . "
at the same time , he said the building of democratic structures in the palestinian-controlled areas is more important than individual leaders .
still , he said doubts about arafat 's ability to contain terrorism are justified .
new aid for africa at the secluded rocky mountain resort kananaskis , the leaders signed off on an a debt-relief package for africa .
the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .
but they failed to firmly earmark for africa half of the $ 12 billion a year in new aid pledged at the march meeting .
instead , the g8 's closing statement expressed what many observers predicted would be the case : aid decisions will be made by the individual g8 members rather than the group of eight itself .
the u.n. has estimated that at least $ 25 billion is necessary to meet international development goals for africa , and development aid organizations said the g8 was merely providing " non-binding declarations of intent " to give more aid .
" i believe we must help this continent and the people living there .
that has been made clear here , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" for instance , it 's clear that we 're in the process of giving 50 percent of state development aid to africa , " he said .
that aid comes with the provision that the continent adopts policies to strengthen democracy , stability and free markets .
and , despite lobbying from britain and canada , g8 members welcomed , but did not commit themselves to the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , the partnership for development proposed by african states which pledges corruption-free governments in return for aid .
un general secretary-general kofi annan and leaders from five african countries had flown into the meeting under observer status to present the plan .

privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .

full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace . the g8 summit of the world 's richest industrial countries ended in kananaskis , canada , on thursday with agreements on extending full membership and billions in non-proliferation aid to russia and providing modest debt forgiveness for africa 's poorest countries .
however , a plan by united states president george w. bush to call for the ouster of palestinian president yasser arafat met with major resistance from his g8 partners .
middle east debate sidelined on the eve of the conference on monday , bush announced his new plan for peace in the middle east and sought to make it the agenda leader at the annual summit .
however , canadian prime minister jean chretian held firmly to the course he charted and stuck , for the most part , with granting russia membership and approving an aid package for africa , a continent whose development is hampered by rampant disease and abject poverty .
schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .

new aid for africa at the secluded rocky mountain resort kananaskis , the leaders signed off on an a debt-relief package for africa .
the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .

deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .
that 's in addition to the 9,200 layoffs already announced , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees will be looking for work . at the end of 2001 , some 95,000 people were employed by deutsche bank , by the end of next year , that number will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced on thursday evening that it will continue paring its workforce as part of an aggressive cost-control program spearheaded by new chairman josef ackermann , who officially took over the reigns in late may .
he wants deutsche bank to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of 2003 .
the corporate and investment banking division will be hit hardest , where approximately 1,970 employees will lose their jobs , more than half from the americas , 315 in the uk , 310 in the asia / pacific region and 320 in continental europe .
the other 1,800 layoffs , in the private client and asset management divisions , will be lost in germany and other parts of europe .
" in the face of continued bad performance of the markets , " a bank spokesman told reporters , if the bank wants to meet its savings targets " there is no other choice . "
leaner and meaner josef ackermann took over the top spot at deutsche bank with specific goals in mind : lower costs , higher efficiency and with it , higher shareholder value .
he wants to create a leaner , meaner bank , one where the emphasis is on performance and share values , even it that means sacrificing some in the client area .
ackermann finds it unacceptable that when it comes to market capitalization , deutsche bank is only in 21st place world wide .
he says the bank should be in the top five globally and he appears not afraid to make sacrifices to get it there .
one goal is to drive the bank 's market value higher , to ensure it " can play a role in european or global consolidation that will take place in the foreseeable future , " ackermann said .
the bank ’ s share prices have rebounded from their lows from last september , when they were trading at just over 43 euro -lrb- $ 42.91 -rrb- .
for the last few months , a share has traded for around 70 euro -lrb- $ 69.85 -rrb- , still well under its peak of more than 100 euro -lrb- $ 99.79 -rrb- .
in his continuing efforts to slim down , ackermann is also pressing ahead with plans to sell its considerable shareholdings in some of germany 's corporate giants , including daimlerchrysler , continental and axel springer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top banks urged to refrain from compulsory lay-offs trade unions and works councils are working to avoid a wave of compulsory redundancies in germany 's banking sector , as the big four german banks prepare to cut a total of 30,000 jobs , 17,000 of them in germany . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.06.2002 putting germany 's armed forces in private hands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying for all those deployments faced with sinking funding and increasing demands , germany 's armed forces are turning to the private sector for a bailout .
but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .
and by that time scharping and his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , might already be gone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace . the g8 summit of the world 's richest industrial countries ended in kananaskis , canada , on thursday with agreements on extending full membership and billions in non-proliferation aid to russia and providing modest debt forgiveness for africa 's poorest countries .
however , a plan by united states president george w. bush to call for the ouster of palestinian president yasser arafat met with major resistance from his g8 partners .
middle east debate sidelined on the eve of the conference on monday , bush announced his new plan for peace in the middle east and sought to make it the agenda leader at the annual summit .
however , canadian prime minister jean chretian held firmly to the course he charted and stuck , for the most part , with granting russia membership and approving an aid package for africa , a continent whose development is hampered by rampant disease and abject poverty .
schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .
" that is a truism of democracy . "
at the same time , he said the building of democratic structures in the palestinian-controlled areas is more important than individual leaders .
still , he said doubts about arafat 's ability to contain terrorism are justified .

the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .
but they failed to firmly earmark for africa half of the $ 12 billion a year in new aid pledged at the march meeting .

and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .
though the artist is under heavy surveilance , it is unlikely schlingensief will run out of ammo any time soon .

deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .

germany ’ s largest bank announced on thursday evening that it will continue paring its workforce as part of an aggressive cost-control program spearheaded by new chairman josef ackermann , who officially took over the reigns in late may .
he wants deutsche bank to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of 2003 .
the corporate and investment banking division will be hit hardest , where approximately 1,970 employees will lose their jobs , more than half from the americas , 315 in the uk , 310 in the asia / pacific region and 320 in continental europe .
the other 1,800 layoffs , in the private client and asset management divisions , will be lost in germany and other parts of europe .

he says the bank should be in the top five globally and he appears not afraid to make sacrifices to get it there .
one goal is to drive the bank 's market value higher , to ensure it " can play a role in european or global consolidation that will take place in the foreseeable future , " ackermann said .

and christoph schlingensief plays it with a full deck .
these days , the berlin-based performer can be found touring the german republic unleashing an arsenal of controversy and cynicism .
his main target is jürgen möllemann , vice-president of the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose alleged anti-semitic remarks have sparked a quarrel with the central council of jews in germany and unleashed a debate about the country ’ s conduct towards its jewish population .
as a reaction , schlingensief has launched aktion 18 , a shock mock-support campaign of the fdp ’ s efforts to win 18 percent of the german voters in the upcoming september parliamentary election .
the content is a twisted maelstrom of nazi rhetoric and guerrilia public performances echoing the darkest chapters of german history – all supposedly in the name of möllemann ’ s party .
wherever schlingensief appears , books , flags , and straw effigies of ariel sharon go up in flames .
the artist justifies his recent actions with his disdain for the neo-nazi movement .
möllemann ’ s policy is taking up themes of the neo-nazi scene in a manner that is undifferentiated , the performer said .
“ möllemann needs to shut his mouth .
he has hurt many people , especially of the jewish community , and thereby destroyed the work of 20 , 30 years , ” schlingensief told der spiegel .
it is his role as an artist to make a statement , before the election brings möllemann to power .
but in his eagerness to pour oil into an already burning fire , it seems the 41-year-old is also about to get burned .
federal prosecutors have started investigating after möllemann said schlingensief 's performance violated his civil rights .
officials also believe schlingensief ’ s aktion 18 web site displays regalia of organizations deemed unconstitutional in germany .
has he gone too far ?
if schlingensief aims to attract public attention , his tour to “ awake germany ” to the ideas of “ national liberalism ” - a phrase reminiscent of nazi ideology - is right on track .
during a theater performance in the city of duisburg on sunday , the notorious agent provocateur attacked a picture of möllemann with vigor and a power-drill .
law officials are now reviewing a videotape of the action to verify whether schlingensief had chanted “ kill möllemann , ” in front the crowd .
if so , he might face charges of instigating people to commit a criminal act .
“ something was heard there that hasn ’ t been said , ” schlingensief claimed . he insisted there had been a “ dramatic pause ” between the words .
plus , “ what i do on stage has to be seen in the context of art , ” schlingensief told reporters .
möllemann himself said schlingensief ’ s actions transgressed the boundaries of free artistic expression guaranteed by the german constitution , and is demanding criminal prosecution .
the fdp official made a comparison to the case of islamist metin kaplan from cologne , who had been sentenced to four years in prison for instigation to commit murder .
“ our democratic system does not tolerate such appeals , ” möllemann said .
for the volk and the reich schlingensief also uses the world wide web as part of his artillery .
the aktion 18 website mimicks the official site of the fdp in its design and colors .
visitors are greeted with martial marching music , before a speaker proclaims the “ unbreaking effort to unite the german reich . ”
the audio then cuts to a skinhead rock group proclaiming “ we stand by the volk and the reich . ”
on the mock party-website , images of möllemann are displayed next to a sign saying “ jews not wanted . ”
instead of the liberal party ’ s slogan " more take-home pay , more education , more employment " stand the words “ ein volk , ein reich , ein führer . ”
visitors can vote which books should be publicly burned during the campgaign .
edmund stoiber ’ s “ das maß der dinge , ” is currently first among the 17,505 votes before titles by paul spiegel and günter grass .
the site also has links to european right-wingers like the austrian fpö or the french national front , which are presented as allies to take “ revenge for pym ” fortuyn , the recently assassinated dutch politician who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
since some of the other organizations displayed are forbidden by german law , officials are currently deciding if the site needs to be taken off the net .
“ all parts of the site have been assembled from sources available elesewhere on the web , ” schlingensief defended the website and urged officials to also check the original sources .
no end in sight with a history of persisting in the face of possible punishment , it is unlikely christoph schlingensief will stop .
when jörg haider ’ s fpö became part of the austrian government in 2000 , schlingensief went to vienna where he wielded signs saying “ out with the foreigners , ” and locked up several asylum seekers inside a container .
though heavily criticized and slapped with an fpö lawsuit , schlingensief managed to escape unscathed - and undaunted .
“ i will stick to my issues , ” he said .
though the artist is under heavy surveilance , it is unlikely schlingensief will run out of ammo any time soon .
the aktion 18 campaign is expected to continue fueling the flames of controversy in cologne on friday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links aktion18 website free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- website dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace . the g8 summit of the world 's richest industrial countries ended in kananaskis , canada , on thursday with agreements on extending full membership and billions in non-proliferation aid to russia and providing modest debt forgiveness for africa 's poorest countries .
however , a plan by united states president george w. bush to call for the ouster of palestinian president yasser arafat met with major resistance from his g8 partners .
middle east debate sidelined on the eve of the conference on monday , bush announced his new plan for peace in the middle east and sought to make it the agenda leader at the annual summit .
however , canadian prime minister jean chretian held firmly to the course he charted and stuck , for the most part , with granting russia membership and approving an aid package for africa , a continent whose development is hampered by rampant disease and abject poverty .
schröder offers support for bush though the g8 failed to find agreement on the middle east other than the need for the creation of an independent palestinian state , germany 's schröder offered support for the new mideast plan bush proposed on monday .
" everyone understands that as a matter of course , it is a given right for the palestinian people to elect their own leaders , " schröder said .
" that is a truism of democracy . "
at the same time , he said the building of democratic structures in the palestinian-controlled areas is more important than individual leaders .
still , he said doubts about arafat 's ability to contain terrorism are justified .
new aid for africa at the secluded rocky mountain resort kananaskis , the leaders signed off on an a debt-relief package for africa .
the agreement promises that half or more of the funds already pledged last march at a united nations aid financing conference in monterrey , mexico , will go to african countries that root out corruption .
the deal drew mixed reviews : german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed it as a " significant decision , " but the german chapter of the international relief organization oxfam called it " hot air . "
the g8 african action plan fell short of what britain , germany and chrétien had been lobbying for .
under the agreement , the g8 partners pledged to provide additional debt relief of up to $ 1 billion a year for the world 's poorest countries .
but they failed to firmly earmark for africa half of the $ 12 billion a year in new aid pledged at the march meeting .
instead , the g8 's closing statement expressed what many observers predicted would be the case : aid decisions will be made by the individual g8 members rather than the group of eight itself .
the u.n. has estimated that at least $ 25 billion is necessary to meet international development goals for africa , and development aid organizations said the g8 was merely providing " non-binding declarations of intent " to give more aid .
" i believe we must help this continent and the people living there .
that has been made clear here , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" for instance , it 's clear that we 're in the process of giving 50 percent of state development aid to africa , " he said .
that aid comes with the provision that the continent adopts policies to strengthen democracy , stability and free markets .
and , despite lobbying from britain and canada , g8 members welcomed , but did not commit themselves to the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , the partnership for development proposed by african states which pledges corruption-free governments in return for aid .
un general secretary-general kofi annan and leaders from five african countries had flown into the meeting under observer status to present the plan .

but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .

but help wo n't arrive that quickly . it seems that every half year or so , germany ’ s military sends soldiers to a new part of the world to keep peace or help in a war against terrorism .
what began as missions in bosnia and kosovo , have now expanded to the not-so-secret combat deployment of germany ’ s elite brigade in eastern afghanistan , un peacekeepers in kabul and a navy presence outside the horn of africa .
not bad for a military operating on a shoestring budget .
but with no drastic budget increases in sight and ever more demands placed on the bundeswehr , defense minister rudolf scharping is rapidly approaching a financial crisis .
no wonder , then , that scharping has turned to the private sector .
the " b " in bundeswehr , it turns out , is starting to stand for " business " .
this week , the general announced that the business of outfitting conscripts and soldiers in uniforms would be turned over to lion apparell deutschland and hellman worldwide logistics .
the move is expected to save germany ’ s armed forces 718 million euro over the next decade .
privatize , privatize , privatize the decision is one of the first steps of a 1999 plan to privatize the bundeswehr ’ s non-military costs .
those include everything from the socks soldiers wear on the battlefield to the cars officers drive around on germany ’ s military bases .
under the plan , approved by both houses of germany ’ s parliament , the bundeswehr has set up private corporations in which they own a stake to manage the non-military side of the armed forces .
the plan is expected to save 1 billion euro a year beginning in the next few years that can be reinvested in getting the equipment needed to maintain parity with the germany ’ s allies , and scharping has a long wish list .
" i think they were forced to do that , out of necessity , politically speaking " heinz schulte , a military analyst in berlin told dw-world .
schulte calls the privatization a natural step in the increasing modernization of german society .
the country ’ s railway system , post office and telephone company have been transferred from the government ’ s hands to the private sector in the past decade .
it seems only logic that the military should follow , to a certain extent .
dire straits german armed forces are due to get around 24 billion euro from next year ’ s budget , said schulte , far below that of great britain and the united states , and according to defense minister scharping , tens of billions of euro below what is needed .
money for new projects , such as the 600 surface-to-air missiles and new mobile first-aid camp scharping is expected to ask for at a budget meeting next week , is scarce .
earlier this year scharping had to strong-arm members of parliament to put aside money for the purchase of new a400 military transport planes .
the purchase , made in cooperation with eight european countries , is considered a vital first step in europe ’ s goal of unifying its member states ' military and security policies .
scharping has earned disapproving looks from germany ’ s allies for his difficulty in getting the project up and running , but parliament has yet to authorize the money be spent .
" officials have yet to find a solution to an equation in which the military ’ s size may be reduced , its range of tasks may be expanded , its current number of bases may be maintained and its budget may be continously cut , " writes the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ’ s military correspondent karl feldmeyer .
part of the plan a " total flop " the privatization plan has already failed in at least one aspect , said military analyst schulte .
a plan to sell off prime real estate owned by the bundeswehr in the middle of some german big cities fell through .
the army failed to realize the city would want to cut in to the lucrative sale of the land to the developers .
an idea expected to reap billions has so far only earned the bundeswehr 100 million euro , said schulte .
that ’ s roughly 47 million euro short of the money needed to complete just one aspect of the military reform – updating the bundeswehr ’ s aging jet fighters .
" it was a total flop , " schulte said .
for now , scharping will just have to tighten his army ’ s belt hope the privatization money starts coming in a little sooner .
any discussion on military budget increases and the reform the bundeswehr needs will only take place after september ’ s elections , anyway .

teachers and state workers also went on strike , in protest against government repression and argentina 's worsening economic crisis .
well-organised protesters brought the city to a standstill security was tight as groups ranging from left-wing activists to professional associations marched in front of the national congress building , calling for president eduardo duhalde to resign .
government buildings and side streets were filled with heavily armed riot police and water cannons , but the crowd was well-marshalled and under control - a good sign , say correspondents , for the government trying to find a way out of the current economic mess .
the bbc 's peter greste in buenos aires said the protest by about 10,000 people - from manual workers to suited professionals to grandmothers in headscarves - was generally peaceful .
anger at austerity demonstrators told him they were angry about the killings but also about the austerity measures demanded by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- that they blame for argentina 's continuing economic misery .
wednesday 's street violence was the worst for months another bbc correspondent , tom gibb , said the protesters were highly organised and had often brought the capital to a standstill by blocking strategic bridges .
the crowds demanded food handouts and social programmes for argentina 's growing army of unemployed , and also campaigned for the removal of president duhalde 's government .
wednesday 's violence was the worst since december , when 27 people were killed in looting and street battles which forced the then president fernando de la rua to resign .
protests have been a regular occurrence since late last year , when millions of people were plunged into poverty after the government posted the biggest sovereign debt default in history .
the peso was devalued by more than two thirds and millions of bank accounts were frozen .
the argentine economy minister roberto lavagna is in washington to plead with the imf to grant a $ 9.5bn loan to ease the country 's economic crisis .
but our correspondent said that mission was derided by the protesters who continue to pile pressure on the government .

the number of people who had jobs fell 1.8 % during the month to 63.56 million people , the second largest monthly fall since records begun in the 1950s .
" the decline in employment was greater than expected , " said hsbc securities japan chief economist peter morgan .
weak economy with unemployment in japan having stayed above 5 % for 11 months and companies continuing to cut costs as part of essential restructuring exercises , the latest rise caused concerns about whether the country 's export-led recovery could gather steam .
in particular , with fewer people earning money , economists predicted a fall in consumer spending which accounts for 55 % of economic activity in japan .
" short-term it has a negative impact on consumption , " mr morgan said .
demand is weak in japan and as a consequence prices have fallen for 33 months in a row .
in may , consumer prices fell 0.9 % while in april they fell 1.1 % , according to official figures .

last month , mr duncan smith 's strategy director - and former head of the anti-euro business for sterling group - dominic cummings said mr duncan smith would be kept at arms length in a referendum campaign .
he suggested the current unpopularity of the conservatives would harm the anti-euro cause .
mr duncan smith said he would lead opposition to the single currency from within his own party but he could have no control over the " broad coalition " who would be battling to keep the pound .
he said he was not in favour of a referendum on the single currency .

" my strategy , the thing that i have set out to do with my party , is to try and broaden the recognition of the party to show that actually we are concerned about the quality of life issues in a way that we were n't . "

the reduction , which comes in addition to 9,200 previously announced job cuts , is part of the bank 's push to slash costs in order to save 2bn euros -lrb- £ 1.29bn ; $ 1.97bn -rrb- a year .
just over half the jobs will be lost in the bank 's corporate and investment bank division over the next 12 months with the rest being cut from its private client and asset management division as well as in infrastructure areas , the bank said .
the corporate and investment banking job cuts will come across the world .
just over half of them will come in the americas , 315 in the uk , 320 in the rest of europe and 310 in the asia-pacific region .
most of the money management jobs will be lost in germany and elsewhere in europe .
return to profits deutsche bank said it would take a restructuring charge of about 265m euros later this year .
following the latest round of cuts , deutsche will have cut almost 13,000 from its 97,000 strong workforce .
the bank set out to restructure after its net profits were almost wiped out in 2001 when they fell from 13.5bn euros the previous year to just 167m euros .
the bank 's financial performance is already improving .
during the first three months of 2002 , its net profits rose to 597 million euros .
deutsche 's shares rose 4.3 % on thursday .

as the judge in the case , mr justice butterfield , discharged the jurors on thursday afternoon , he reminded them to take all the time they needed to consider the evidence presented over the past two months .
david morris , 40 , denies killing three generations of the same family at a house in the swansea valley on 27 june 1999 .
the judge had completed his third day of summing up on wednesday and gave final points of direction to the jurors before sending them away at lunchtime to begin deliberations .
he told the panel of 11 jurors - one was discharged earlier in the trial after suffering a stroke - that they should use " common sense and knowledge of the world " in arriving at their decision .
on thursday , he gave the jury the option of a weekend sitting , if they thought it would help in coming to their verdict .
he said : " i do not know how your deliberations are progressing , whether by sitting longer tomorrow you may be able to reach a decision or whether you think you could do with a break at the weekend .
" there is even a possibility that you could sit on saturday . "
he added : " i am not offering it to you with any great eagerness but it is something that you should think about . "
mandy power , 34 ; her daughters katie , 10 ; and emily , eight ; and her mother doris dawson , 80 , all died in what has been described by the prosecution as a " massacre " .
mr morris , of nearby craig cefn parc denies the murder charges in the case which began at the court in april .
mr butterfield reviewed the arguments the jury had heard over the past 11 weeks .
" the events of that night have left marks which are deep and , perhaps , indelible on the lives of many , " he said .
" the prosecution say that the man responsible for these killings was david morris .
' sexual desire ' " he , they say , possessed a sexual desire for mandy power and , on an evening when he was angry and rejected by his partner , fuelled with amphetamines and alcohol , he went to her home and pressed these desires . "
it was the defence case that , whoever the killer was , it was " certainly not david morris " , the judge continued .
" the defence has asserted who the killer was , and they suggest that the police got it right in 2000 when they arrested alison lewis . "
during his speech , mr butterfield graphically described the murder scene , saying the upstairs of the house was " awash with blood . "
" you would need a heart of stone not to be deeply affected by the photographs of the injuries , " he said .
he also asked the jury to consider whether former suspect alison lewis would have been able to carry out the killings .
he reminded the jury she had left the police after being unable to cope with dealing with a suicide .
mr butterfield invited them to consider all the evidence presented to them , but also said they should " view with caution " evidence about a gold chain found at the scene of the crime .
earlier in the week he said they might feel " anger and outrage " at the brutality of the murders , but told them there was no place for " emotion or prejudice . " ^ ^ back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- feedback -pipe- ©

jim mcnulty , the firm 's investigator in scotland , said : " coa labels have become very valuable items to software counterfeiters .
" they will apply them to a counterfeit product rather than a genuine product and this has the effect of the persuading the buyer that the software is genuine when it is in fact counterfeit . "
increasing numbers of people are being taken in by counterfeit software because of the difficulty of spotting it .
clackmannanshire council bought fake product licences by mistake two years ago .

the overtime ban is believed to be the first industrial action in britain mounted over the pensions issue .
workers belonging to the iron and steel trades confederation -lrb- istc -rrb- are taking action at the caparo merchant bar factory in scunthorpe .
" it is outrageous that a company claiming to be committed to partnership , transferred ownership of its pension scheme into the hands of trustees before they even met us to discuss our concerns , " said michael leahy , the union 's general secretary .
the closure of the more secure final salary schemes at many companies , and their replacement by less secure defined contribution schemes , has generated widespread concern about future retirement provision .
mr leahy said he would urge workers to take industrial action wherever financial salary pension schemes were threatened .
industrial action at plants run by caparo group is designed to highlight the problem , and the workers have not ruled out strike action .
union members at the group 's plants in south wales are also expected to protest at the decision to introduce a new pensions scheme linked to the ups and downs of the stock market .
the union says members will face the prospect of a much reduced income , after years of service .
the steelworkers ' action on friday coincides with a further warning that britons will need to save more , or work longer , to secure a reasonable retirement income .
pension worries research from the pension consultancy hewitt , bacon and woodrow revealed that many people have yet to wake up to the potential problems ahead .
more than half of people surveyed said they were not concerned about their retirement income .
this represents a dangerous complacency , the firm said .
of respondents who said they were concerned , more than three quarters said they were prepared to increase their savings or pension contribution .
but only 22 % were prepared to contemplate working full time to the age of 70 .
the survey also suggested that younger people -lrb- aged 16-44 -rrb- were more willing to raise their pension contributions that those in the 45-55 year age range .
hewitt , bacon and woodrow concluded that workers must rapidly increase their pension payments , or be ready to work beyond the official retirement age , if they are to avoid a major shortfall in their retirement provision .
michael pomery , an associate at the firm , said : " whilst it is encouraging that many people understand that sacrifices will have to be made in order to provide satisfactory retirement incomes , this needs to be translated into action . "

the rise followed a 31 % rise in profits during the previous quarter .
the company also reported an 8 % rise in sales to $ 2.68bn from $ 2.48bn a year earlier .
" we enjoyed growth across footwear , apparel and equipment in each of our international regions , " said chief executive philip knight .
" in the environment we 're dealing with , that 's pretty impressive , and i think it shows the strength of the brand , " said lehman brothers analyst robert drbul .
us weakness other analysts were sceptical about nike 's performance in its home us market .
the company 's global order book was up 7 % .
asia and europe was up 12 % while the us was up just 3 % .
this , said john shanley of wells fargo securities , was a sign that its attempt to sell increasingly expensive basketball shoes to teenage boys had failed .
mr shanley slammed the company 's nike shox shoes which at $ 150 a pair were far too expensive .
he also criticised the company 's michael jordan basketball shoes which were selling at $ 200 a pair along with a metal case and a promotional cd and " which turned out to be the proverbial bomb " .
mr knight insisted that nike is doing well in the us .
" we delivered significant improvement in our usa results by reinvigorating our usa footwear business , reducing inventory , and building a solid foundation in our apparel business , " he said .
nike shares gained 4.8 % on thursday .
