former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .

but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .
we have to obtain frequencies quickly and also pay our large team of specialised engineers .
if we can ’ t even move forward with funding , i don ’ t know what the u.s. is going to think about us , " the eu official said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sharing space europe union transportation ministers have given the go-ahead to a satellite system that will make europe independent from american global positioning systems .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .
we have to obtain frequencies quickly and also pay our large team of specialised engineers .
if we can ’ t even move forward with funding , i don ’ t know what the u.s. is going to think about us , " the eu official said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sharing space europe union transportation ministers have given the go-ahead to a satellite system that will make europe independent from american global positioning systems .

" " germany is one of our closest friends , " powell told the newspaper " izvestia . " " and differences and difficulties will arise in any relationship from time to time , but the strength of the relationship between the united states and germany will remain and , i expect , will thrive and grow , " he said . the bush administration is said to be angered over statements allegedly made by german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing bush 's methods with those of hitler as well as by schröder 's steadfast refusal to support military action against iraq . in warsaw , struck proposed that germany and the netherlands could together lead the u.n.-mandated isaf peacekeeping force in afghanistan after turkey leaves the post in december . currently , 1,200 german soldiers are participating in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , and struck has proposed expanding the number of troops by deploying the german-dutch corps , a nato force comprising soldiers from both countries that is stationed in the western german city of münster .

the paper , intended as a defense of blair 's strong pro-american stance , drew sharp criticism from senior iraqi officials .
schröder and blair " discussed a range of issues including iraq , afghanistan and various eu matters , " a blair spokesman told reuters , declining to go into details but insisting the atmosphere was " warm and informal " .
powell : " relationship will thrive and grow " both moves appeared to be part of a reconciliatory offensive on the part of schröder 's cabinet , and they came on the same day a russian newspaper published an interview with colin powell in which the secretary of state said that relations between the two countries continued to be " tight " and " good . " " germany is one of our closest friends , " powell told the newspaper " izvestia . " " and differences and difficulties will arise in any relationship from time to time , but the strength of the relationship between the united states and germany will remain and , i expect , will thrive and grow , " he said . the bush administration is said to be angered over statements allegedly made by german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing bush 's methods with those of hitler as well as by schröder 's steadfast refusal to support military action against iraq . in warsaw , struck proposed that germany and the netherlands could together lead the u.n.-mandated isaf peacekeeping force in afghanistan after turkey leaves the post in december . currently , 1,200 german soldiers are participating in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , and struck has proposed expanding the number of troops by deploying the german-dutch corps , a nato force comprising soldiers from both countries that is stationed in the western german city of münster . " we would be taking over additional responsibilities that i think the american government will reward , " struck told reporters . little hope for meeting with rumsfeld but he still held out little hope for a meeting with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , who publicly snubbed struck as a result of a " poisoning " of the political atmosphere between washington and berlin .
nonetheless , struck said , relations did not appear to be " seriously tense . " " i think the american government , which is attached to a long tradition of democracy , will accept the fact that we have a newly elected government that they will have to work together with well during the next four years , " struck said . rumsfeld 's snubbing of struck was particularly remarkable given that the summit represented struck 's first-ever meeting as german defense minister with his counterparts from the other nato alliance members .
struck replaced former defense minister rudolf scharping in july after his abrupt firing in july over a conflict of interest . the white house has so far refused to issue its traditional statement greeting the new german government .
on tuesday , however , state department spokesman richard boucher offered a tepid acknowledgement . " obviously , we welcome a democratic election .
voters of germany have spoken clearly through a democratic process , and we look forward to working with the german government on issues of common interest , " he said . iraq casts cloud over nato , eu-asia summits the rift in relations between the united states and germany , which reached its high point during germany 's cliffhanger election over the weekend , simmered in the background this week at two major international summits being held in copenhagen and warsaw . at the opening of the asia-europe summit in copenhagen , denmark , european commission president romano prodi sought to defuse the situation on monday by describing the hot-house atmosphere as a misinterpretation of german political culture . " if there is a poisoning of relations , then there is a misunderstanding of democracy in germany , " prodi told reporters .
" we must be prepared to work together to discuss issues publicly . "
he added that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's positions on iraq , as laid out in his election battle , should not be perceived as an " aggressive campaign " against the united states . there are few " differences of opinion " between the u.s. and europe , and right now those are primarily the establishment of the international criminal court and the question of how to resolve the diplomatic impassé with iraq . " in those areas we disagree , but that does n't mean we do n't feel deep friendship , " he said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , who is the european union 's current rotating president , has so far refused to comment on the u.s.-germany spat .
but on monday he said it would " not have the slightest effect " on eu-u.s. relations .
however , he did admit there were " nuances " in positions between european countries over iraq . french president jacqués chirac attempted to introduce a resolution at the asia-europe summit condemning the united states if it acted alone against saddam hussein .
but the proposed resolution failed to gain traction after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi rejected it , instead asking delegates to be respectful of " american sensitivities . " the leaders at the summit – including heads of state from europe and asia – agreed to a broadly-worded statement ordering that all military engagements should be under the mandate of the united nations .
but it did n't specifically mention iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to repair a " badly bruised " relationship with a heated , anti-american campaign behind him , chancellor schröder is eager to smooth things out with washington .
transatlantic experts say he has his work cut out for him .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .
we have to obtain frequencies quickly and also pay our large team of specialised engineers .
if we can ’ t even move forward with funding , i don ’ t know what the u.s. is going to think about us , " the eu official said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sharing space europe union transportation ministers have given the go-ahead to a satellite system that will make europe independent from american global positioning systems .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

the paper , intended as a defense of blair 's strong pro-american stance , drew sharp criticism from senior iraqi officials .
schröder and blair " discussed a range of issues including iraq , afghanistan and various eu matters , " a blair spokesman told reuters , declining to go into details but insisting the atmosphere was " warm and informal " .
powell : " relationship will thrive and grow " both moves appeared to be part of a reconciliatory offensive on the part of schröder 's cabinet , and they came on the same day a russian newspaper published an interview with colin powell in which the secretary of state said that relations between the two countries continued to be " tight " and " good . " " germany is one of our closest friends , " powell told the newspaper " izvestia . " " and differences and difficulties will arise in any relationship from time to time , but the strength of the relationship between the united states and germany will remain and , i expect , will thrive and grow , " he said . the bush administration is said to be angered over statements allegedly made by german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing bush 's methods with those of hitler as well as by schröder 's steadfast refusal to support military action against iraq . in warsaw , struck proposed that germany and the netherlands could together lead the u.n.-mandated isaf peacekeeping force in afghanistan after turkey leaves the post in december . currently , 1,200 german soldiers are participating in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , and struck has proposed expanding the number of troops by deploying the german-dutch corps , a nato force comprising soldiers from both countries that is stationed in the western german city of münster . " we would be taking over additional responsibilities that i think the american government will reward , " struck told reporters . little hope for meeting with rumsfeld but he still held out little hope for a meeting with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , who publicly snubbed struck as a result of a " poisoning " of the political atmosphere between washington and berlin .
nonetheless , struck said , relations did not appear to be " seriously tense . " " i think the american government , which is attached to a long tradition of democracy , will accept the fact that we have a newly elected government that they will have to work together with well during the next four years , " struck said . rumsfeld 's snubbing of struck was particularly remarkable given that the summit represented struck 's first-ever meeting as german defense minister with his counterparts from the other nato alliance members .
struck replaced former defense minister rudolf scharping in july after his abrupt firing in july over a conflict of interest . the white house has so far refused to issue its traditional statement greeting the new german government .
on tuesday , however , state department spokesman richard boucher offered a tepid acknowledgement . " obviously , we welcome a democratic election .
voters of germany have spoken clearly through a democratic process , and we look forward to working with the german government on issues of common interest , " he said . iraq casts cloud over nato , eu-asia summits the rift in relations between the united states and germany , which reached its high point during germany 's cliffhanger election over the weekend , simmered in the background this week at two major international summits being held in copenhagen and warsaw . at the opening of the asia-europe summit in copenhagen , denmark , european commission president romano prodi sought to defuse the situation on monday by describing the hot-house atmosphere as a misinterpretation of german political culture . " if there is a poisoning of relations , then there is a misunderstanding of democracy in germany , " prodi told reporters .
" we must be prepared to work together to discuss issues publicly . "
he added that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's positions on iraq , as laid out in his election battle , should not be perceived as an " aggressive campaign " against the united states . there are few " differences of opinion " between the u.s. and europe , and right now those are primarily the establishment of the international criminal court and the question of how to resolve the diplomatic impassé with iraq . " in those areas we disagree , but that does n't mean we do n't feel deep friendship , " he said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , who is the european union 's current rotating president , has so far refused to comment on the u.s.-germany spat .
but on monday he said it would " not have the slightest effect " on eu-u.s. relations .
however , he did admit there were " nuances " in positions between european countries over iraq . french president jacqués chirac attempted to introduce a resolution at the asia-europe summit condemning the united states if it acted alone against saddam hussein .
but the proposed resolution failed to gain traction after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi rejected it , instead asking delegates to be respectful of " american sensitivities .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .
we have to obtain frequencies quickly and also pay our large team of specialised engineers .

the paper , intended as a defense of blair 's strong pro-american stance , drew sharp criticism from senior iraqi officials .
schröder and blair " discussed a range of issues including iraq , afghanistan and various eu matters , " a blair spokesman told reuters , declining to go into details but insisting the atmosphere was " warm and informal " .
powell : " relationship will thrive and grow " both moves appeared to be part of a reconciliatory offensive on the part of schröder 's cabinet , and they came on the same day a russian newspaper published an interview with colin powell in which the secretary of state said that relations between the two countries continued to be " tight " and " good . " " germany is one of our closest friends , " powell told the newspaper " izvestia . " " and differences and difficulties will arise in any relationship from time to time , but the strength of the relationship between the united states and germany will remain and , i expect , will thrive and grow , " he said . the bush administration is said to be angered over statements allegedly made by german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing bush 's methods with those of hitler as well as by schröder 's steadfast refusal to support military action against iraq . in warsaw , struck proposed that germany and the netherlands could together lead the u.n.-mandated isaf peacekeeping force in afghanistan after turkey leaves the post in december . currently , 1,200 german soldiers are participating in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , and struck has proposed expanding the number of troops by deploying the german-dutch corps , a nato force comprising soldiers from both countries that is stationed in the western german city of münster . " we would be taking over additional responsibilities that i think the american government will reward , " struck told reporters . little hope for meeting with rumsfeld but he still held out little hope for a meeting with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , who publicly snubbed struck as a result of a " poisoning " of the political atmosphere between washington and berlin .
nonetheless , struck said , relations did not appear to be " seriously tense . " " i think the american government , which is attached to a long tradition of democracy , will accept the fact that we have a newly elected government that they will have to work together with well during the next four years , " struck said . rumsfeld 's snubbing of struck was particularly remarkable given that the summit represented struck 's first-ever meeting as german defense minister with his counterparts from the other nato alliance members .
struck replaced former defense minister rudolf scharping in july after his abrupt firing in july over a conflict of interest . the white house has so far refused to issue its traditional statement greeting the new german government .
on tuesday , however , state department spokesman richard boucher offered a tepid acknowledgement . " obviously , we welcome a democratic election .
voters of germany have spoken clearly through a democratic process , and we look forward to working with the german government on issues of common interest , " he said . iraq casts cloud over nato , eu-asia summits the rift in relations between the united states and germany , which reached its high point during germany 's cliffhanger election over the weekend , simmered in the background this week at two major international summits being held in copenhagen and warsaw . at the opening of the asia-europe summit in copenhagen , denmark , european commission president romano prodi sought to defuse the situation on monday by describing the hot-house atmosphere as a misinterpretation of german political culture . " if there is a poisoning of relations , then there is a misunderstanding of democracy in germany , " prodi told reporters .
" we must be prepared to work together to discuss issues publicly . "
he added that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's positions on iraq , as laid out in his election battle , should not be perceived as an " aggressive campaign " against the united states . there are few " differences of opinion " between the u.s. and europe , and right now those are primarily the establishment of the international criminal court and the question of how to resolve the diplomatic impassé with iraq .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .
we have to obtain frequencies quickly and also pay our large team of specialised engineers .
if we can ’ t even move forward with funding , i don ’ t know what the u.s. is going to think about us , " the eu official said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sharing space europe union transportation ministers have given the go-ahead to a satellite system that will make europe independent from american global positioning systems .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .
we have to obtain frequencies quickly and also pay our large team of specialised engineers .

the paper , intended as a defense of blair 's strong pro-american stance , drew sharp criticism from senior iraqi officials .
schröder and blair " discussed a range of issues including iraq , afghanistan and various eu matters , " a blair spokesman told reuters , declining to go into details but insisting the atmosphere was " warm and informal " .
powell : " relationship will thrive and grow " both moves appeared to be part of a reconciliatory offensive on the part of schröder 's cabinet , and they came on the same day a russian newspaper published an interview with colin powell in which the secretary of state said that relations between the two countries continued to be " tight " and " good . " " germany is one of our closest friends , " powell told the newspaper " izvestia . " " and differences and difficulties will arise in any relationship from time to time , but the strength of the relationship between the united states and germany will remain and , i expect , will thrive and grow , " he said . the bush administration is said to be angered over statements allegedly made by german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing bush 's methods with those of hitler as well as by schröder 's steadfast refusal to support military action against iraq . in warsaw , struck proposed that germany and the netherlands could together lead the u.n.-mandated isaf peacekeeping force in afghanistan after turkey leaves the post in december . currently , 1,200 german soldiers are participating in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , and struck has proposed expanding the number of troops by deploying the german-dutch corps , a nato force comprising soldiers from both countries that is stationed in the western german city of münster . " we would be taking over additional responsibilities that i think the american government will reward , " struck told reporters . little hope for meeting with rumsfeld but he still held out little hope for a meeting with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , who publicly snubbed struck as a result of a " poisoning " of the political atmosphere between washington and berlin .
nonetheless , struck said , relations did not appear to be " seriously tense . " " i think the american government , which is attached to a long tradition of democracy , will accept the fact that we have a newly elected government that they will have to work together with well during the next four years , " struck said . rumsfeld 's snubbing of struck was particularly remarkable given that the summit represented struck 's first-ever meeting as german defense minister with his counterparts from the other nato alliance members .
struck replaced former defense minister rudolf scharping in july after his abrupt firing in july over a conflict of interest . the white house has so far refused to issue its traditional statement greeting the new german government .
on tuesday , however , state department spokesman richard boucher offered a tepid acknowledgement . " obviously , we welcome a democratic election .
voters of germany have spoken clearly through a democratic process , and we look forward to working with the german government on issues of common interest , " he said . iraq casts cloud over nato , eu-asia summits the rift in relations between the united states and germany , which reached its high point during germany 's cliffhanger election over the weekend , simmered in the background this week at two major international summits being held in copenhagen and warsaw . at the opening of the asia-europe summit in copenhagen , denmark , european commission president romano prodi sought to defuse the situation on monday by describing the hot-house atmosphere as a misinterpretation of german political culture . " if there is a poisoning of relations , then there is a misunderstanding of democracy in germany , " prodi told reporters .
" we must be prepared to work together to discuss issues publicly . "
he added that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's positions on iraq , as laid out in his election battle , should not be perceived as an " aggressive campaign " against the united states . there are few " differences of opinion " between the u.s. and europe , and right now those are primarily the establishment of the international criminal court and the question of how to resolve the diplomatic impassé with iraq . " in those areas we disagree , but that does n't mean we do n't feel deep friendship , " he said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , who is the european union 's current rotating president , has so far refused to comment on the u.s.-germany spat .
but on monday he said it would " not have the slightest effect " on eu-u.s. relations .
however , he did admit there were " nuances " in positions between european countries over iraq . french president jacqués chirac attempted to introduce a resolution at the asia-europe summit condemning the united states if it acted alone against saddam hussein .
but the proposed resolution failed to gain traction after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi rejected it , instead asking delegates to be respectful of " american sensitivities . " the leaders at the summit – including heads of state from europe and asia – agreed to a broadly-worded statement ordering that all military engagements should be under the mandate of the united nations .
but it did n't specifically mention iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to repair a " badly bruised " relationship with a heated , anti-american campaign behind him , chancellor schröder is eager to smooth things out with washington .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

the paper , intended as a defense of blair 's strong pro-american stance , drew sharp criticism from senior iraqi officials .
schröder and blair " discussed a range of issues including iraq , afghanistan and various eu matters , " a blair spokesman told reuters , declining to go into details but insisting the atmosphere was " warm and informal " .
powell : " relationship will thrive and grow " both moves appeared to be part of a reconciliatory offensive on the part of schröder 's cabinet , and they came on the same day a russian newspaper published an interview with colin powell in which the secretary of state said that relations between the two countries continued to be " tight " and " good . " " germany is one of our closest friends , " powell told the newspaper " izvestia . " " and differences and difficulties will arise in any relationship from time to time , but the strength of the relationship between the united states and germany will remain and , i expect , will thrive and grow , " he said . the bush administration is said to be angered over statements allegedly made by german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing bush 's methods with those of hitler as well as by schröder 's steadfast refusal to support military action against iraq . in warsaw , struck proposed that germany and the netherlands could together lead the u.n.-mandated isaf peacekeeping force in afghanistan after turkey leaves the post in december . currently , 1,200 german soldiers are participating in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , and struck has proposed expanding the number of troops by deploying the german-dutch corps , a nato force comprising soldiers from both countries that is stationed in the western german city of münster . " we would be taking over additional responsibilities that i think the american government will reward , " struck told reporters . little hope for meeting with rumsfeld but he still held out little hope for a meeting with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , who publicly snubbed struck as a result of a " poisoning " of the political atmosphere between washington and berlin .
nonetheless , struck said , relations did not appear to be " seriously tense . " " i think the american government , which is attached to a long tradition of democracy , will accept the fact that we have a newly elected government that they will have to work together with well during the next four years , " struck said . rumsfeld 's snubbing of struck was particularly remarkable given that the summit represented struck 's first-ever meeting as german defense minister with his counterparts from the other nato alliance members .
struck replaced former defense minister rudolf scharping in july after his abrupt firing in july over a conflict of interest . the white house has so far refused to issue its traditional statement greeting the new german government .
on tuesday , however , state department spokesman richard boucher offered a tepid acknowledgement . " obviously , we welcome a democratic election .
voters of germany have spoken clearly through a democratic process , and we look forward to working with the german government on issues of common interest , " he said . iraq casts cloud over nato , eu-asia summits the rift in relations between the united states and germany , which reached its high point during germany 's cliffhanger election over the weekend , simmered in the background this week at two major international summits being held in copenhagen and warsaw . at the opening of the asia-europe summit in copenhagen , denmark , european commission president romano prodi sought to defuse the situation on monday by describing the hot-house atmosphere as a misinterpretation of german political culture . " if there is a poisoning of relations , then there is a misunderstanding of democracy in germany , " prodi told reporters .
" we must be prepared to work together to discuss issues publicly . "
he added that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's positions on iraq , as laid out in his election battle , should not be perceived as an " aggressive campaign " against the united states . there are few " differences of opinion " between the u.s. and europe , and right now those are primarily the establishment of the international criminal court and the question of how to resolve the diplomatic impassé with iraq . " in those areas we disagree , but that does n't mean we do n't feel deep friendship , " he said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , who is the european union 's current rotating president , has so far refused to comment on the u.s.-germany spat .
but on monday he said it would " not have the slightest effect " on eu-u.s. relations .
however , he did admit there were " nuances " in positions between european countries over iraq . french president jacqués chirac attempted to introduce a resolution at the asia-europe summit condemning the united states if it acted alone against saddam hussein .
but the proposed resolution failed to gain traction after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi rejected it , instead asking delegates to be respectful of " american sensitivities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.09.2002 europe 's galileo runs into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european answer to gps - galileo europe ’ s ambitious 3.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.14 billion -rrb- flagship galileo satellite navigation programme is floundering on account of squabbling between germany and italy over the leadership of the european space agency . when eu transport ministers gave the green light for europe ’ s very own satellite navigation programme , called galileo , in march , it seemed like the continent was well on its way to becoming a dominant player in the global satellite scene .
but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

the paper , intended as a defense of blair 's strong pro-american stance , drew sharp criticism from senior iraqi officials .
schröder and blair " discussed a range of issues including iraq , afghanistan and various eu matters , " a blair spokesman told reuters , declining to go into details but insisting the atmosphere was " warm and informal " .
powell : " relationship will thrive and grow " both moves appeared to be part of a reconciliatory offensive on the part of schröder 's cabinet , and they came on the same day a russian newspaper published an interview with colin powell in which the secretary of state said that relations between the two countries continued to be " tight " and " good . " " germany is one of our closest friends , " powell told the newspaper " izvestia . " " and differences and difficulties will arise in any relationship from time to time , but the strength of the relationship between the united states and germany will remain and , i expect , will thrive and grow , " he said . the bush administration is said to be angered over statements allegedly made by german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing bush 's methods with those of hitler as well as by schröder 's steadfast refusal to support military action against iraq . in warsaw , struck proposed that germany and the netherlands could together lead the u.n.-mandated isaf peacekeeping force in afghanistan after turkey leaves the post in december . currently , 1,200 german soldiers are participating in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , and struck has proposed expanding the number of troops by deploying the german-dutch corps , a nato force comprising soldiers from both countries that is stationed in the western german city of münster . " we would be taking over additional responsibilities that i think the american government will reward , " struck told reporters . little hope for meeting with rumsfeld but he still held out little hope for a meeting with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , who publicly snubbed struck as a result of a " poisoning " of the political atmosphere between washington and berlin .
nonetheless , struck said , relations did not appear to be " seriously tense . " " i think the american government , which is attached to a long tradition of democracy , will accept the fact that we have a newly elected government that they will have to work together with well during the next four years , " struck said . rumsfeld 's snubbing of struck was particularly remarkable given that the summit represented struck 's first-ever meeting as german defense minister with his counterparts from the other nato alliance members .
struck replaced former defense minister rudolf scharping in july after his abrupt firing in july over a conflict of interest . the white house has so far refused to issue its traditional statement greeting the new german government .
on tuesday , however , state department spokesman richard boucher offered a tepid acknowledgement . " obviously , we welcome a democratic election .
voters of germany have spoken clearly through a democratic process , and we look forward to working with the german government on issues of common interest , " he said . iraq casts cloud over nato , eu-asia summits the rift in relations between the united states and germany , which reached its high point during germany 's cliffhanger election over the weekend , simmered in the background this week at two major international summits being held in copenhagen and warsaw . at the opening of the asia-europe summit in copenhagen , denmark , european commission president romano prodi sought to defuse the situation on monday by describing the hot-house atmosphere as a misinterpretation of german political culture . " if there is a poisoning of relations , then there is a misunderstanding of democracy in germany , " prodi told reporters .
" we must be prepared to work together to discuss issues publicly . "
he added that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's positions on iraq , as laid out in his election battle , should not be perceived as an " aggressive campaign " against the united states . there are few " differences of opinion " between the u.s. and europe , and right now those are primarily the establishment of the international criminal court and the question of how to resolve the diplomatic impassé with iraq . " in those areas we disagree , but that does n't mean we do n't feel deep friendship , " he said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , who is the european union 's current rotating president , has so far refused to comment on the u.s.-germany spat .
but on monday he said it would " not have the slightest effect " on eu-u.s. relations .
however , he did admit there were " nuances " in positions between european countries over iraq . french president jacqués chirac attempted to introduce a resolution at the asia-europe summit condemning the united states if it acted alone against saddam hussein .
but the proposed resolution failed to gain traction after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi rejected it , instead asking delegates to be respectful of " american sensitivities . " the leaders at the summit – including heads of state from europe and asia – agreed to a broadly-worded statement ordering that all military engagements should be under the mandate of the united nations .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .
it just wo n't be in the vivid pink colours of team telekom . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .
we have to obtain frequencies quickly and also pay our large team of specialised engineers .
if we can ’ t even move forward with funding , i don ’ t know what the u.s. is going to think about us , " the eu official said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sharing space europe union transportation ministers have given the go-ahead to a satellite system that will make europe independent from american global positioning systems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2002 jan ullrich quits team telekom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riding off into the sunset : ullrich and telekom go their seperate ways .
former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.09.2002 europe 's galileo runs into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european answer to gps - galileo europe ’ s ambitious 3.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.14 billion -rrb- flagship galileo satellite navigation programme is floundering on account of squabbling between germany and italy over the leadership of the european space agency . when eu transport ministers gave the green light for europe ’ s very own satellite navigation programme , called galileo , in march , it seemed like the continent was well on its way to becoming a dominant player in the global satellite scene .
but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .
we have to obtain frequencies quickly and also pay our large team of specialised engineers .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .

the paper , intended as a defense of blair 's strong pro-american stance , drew sharp criticism from senior iraqi officials .
schröder and blair " discussed a range of issues including iraq , afghanistan and various eu matters , " a blair spokesman told reuters , declining to go into details but insisting the atmosphere was " warm and informal " .
powell : " relationship will thrive and grow " both moves appeared to be part of a reconciliatory offensive on the part of schröder 's cabinet , and they came on the same day a russian newspaper published an interview with colin powell in which the secretary of state said that relations between the two countries continued to be " tight " and " good . " " germany is one of our closest friends , " powell told the newspaper " izvestia . " " and differences and difficulties will arise in any relationship from time to time , but the strength of the relationship between the united states and germany will remain and , i expect , will thrive and grow , " he said . the bush administration is said to be angered over statements allegedly made by german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing bush 's methods with those of hitler as well as by schröder 's steadfast refusal to support military action against iraq . in warsaw , struck proposed that germany and the netherlands could together lead the u.n.-mandated isaf peacekeeping force in afghanistan after turkey leaves the post in december . currently , 1,200 german soldiers are participating in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , and struck has proposed expanding the number of troops by deploying the german-dutch corps , a nato force comprising soldiers from both countries that is stationed in the western german city of münster . " we would be taking over additional responsibilities that i think the american government will reward , " struck told reporters . little hope for meeting with rumsfeld but he still held out little hope for a meeting with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , who publicly snubbed struck as a result of a " poisoning " of the political atmosphere between washington and berlin .
nonetheless , struck said , relations did not appear to be " seriously tense . " " i think the american government , which is attached to a long tradition of democracy , will accept the fact that we have a newly elected government that they will have to work together with well during the next four years , " struck said . rumsfeld 's snubbing of struck was particularly remarkable given that the summit represented struck 's first-ever meeting as german defense minister with his counterparts from the other nato alliance members .
struck replaced former defense minister rudolf scharping in july after his abrupt firing in july over a conflict of interest . the white house has so far refused to issue its traditional statement greeting the new german government .
on tuesday , however , state department spokesman richard boucher offered a tepid acknowledgement . " obviously , we welcome a democratic election .
voters of germany have spoken clearly through a democratic process , and we look forward to working with the german government on issues of common interest , " he said . iraq casts cloud over nato , eu-asia summits the rift in relations between the united states and germany , which reached its high point during germany 's cliffhanger election over the weekend , simmered in the background this week at two major international summits being held in copenhagen and warsaw . at the opening of the asia-europe summit in copenhagen , denmark , european commission president romano prodi sought to defuse the situation on monday by describing the hot-house atmosphere as a misinterpretation of german political culture . " if there is a poisoning of relations , then there is a misunderstanding of democracy in germany , " prodi told reporters .
" we must be prepared to work together to discuss issues publicly . "
he added that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's positions on iraq , as laid out in his election battle , should not be perceived as an " aggressive campaign " against the united states . there are few " differences of opinion " between the u.s. and europe , and right now those are primarily the establishment of the international criminal court and the question of how to resolve the diplomatic impassé with iraq . " in those areas we disagree , but that does n't mean we do n't feel deep friendship , " he said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , who is the european union 's current rotating president , has so far refused to comment on the u.s.-germany spat .
but on monday he said it would " not have the slightest effect " on eu-u.s. relations .
however , he did admit there were " nuances " in positions between european countries over iraq . french president jacqués chirac attempted to introduce a resolution at the asia-europe summit condemning the united states if it acted alone against saddam hussein .
but the proposed resolution failed to gain traction after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi rejected it , instead asking delegates to be respectful of " american sensitivities . " the leaders at the summit – including heads of state from europe and asia – agreed to a broadly-worded statement ordering that all military engagements should be under the mandate of the united nations .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .
we have to obtain frequencies quickly and also pay our large team of specialised engineers .
if we can ’ t even move forward with funding , i don ’ t know what the u.s. is going to think about us , " the eu official said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sharing space europe union transportation ministers have given the go-ahead to a satellite system that will make europe independent from american global positioning systems .

but almost six months later , the project , a joint initiative of the european commission and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , has run into difficulties on account of bickering between germany and italy over project leadership .
" germany didn ’ t want to give any money until after the federal elections .
and now both germany and italy , the two main contributors to the project , have not been able to agree about who takes over .
it ’ s basically a question of prestige - each one wants to play leader , " an eu official who asked not to be named told dw-world .
tension between germany and italy in a progress report on galileo published on tuesday , the european commission said there had been delays caused by problems over finalising each country ’ s contribution .
" some member states are , mainly for political reasons , claiming the status of the foremost contributor to the programme , " the report said .
an eu official told reuters that italy wanted the lead role because it had been involved in galileo early on and it was not leading other esa projects , such as the french-led ariane rocket programme .
but germany had also put itself forward as the project leader on the basis of its financial contributions to esa – some 562 million euro yearly .
this year , germany also increased its funding to esa ’ s scientific research programmes by an additional 30 million euro .
so what is galileo ?
the galileo global network of 30 navigational satellites run entirely by europe will rival the only two existing global navigation systems - the u.s.-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and the almost obsolete russian glonass system .
as far back as the 1990s , the european union saw the need for europe to have its own global satellite navigation system .
the european commission and the european space agency joined forces to build a global satellite navigation system that will be under civilian control .
by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclination to the equatorial plane than gps , galileo is expected to achieve better coverage at high altitudes .
this is hoped to make it better suited for operation over northern europe , an area not well covered by gps .
the galileo satellites are expected to pinpoint one ’ s exact location on a map with an accuracy of one metre .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars , lorries and spacecraft and is expected to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in the future , the satellite network will have other applications too such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
most of the satellites are expected to be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
galileo bogged down by funding problems however , galileo has been mired in controversy and debate for almost a year and a half , partly because eu states such as germany and the uk had reservations about the financial viability of the project that is expected to cost some 3.2 billion euro .
a breakthrough was achieved at the eu transport ministers ’ meeting in march this year where ministers signed off 450 million euro in funds to pay for the next phase of the development programme of galileo .
the money came on top off about 100 million euro already approved and another 500 million euro pledged by the inter-governmental esa .
the meeting also decided that costs for the satellite system , which would have many commercial benefits , should be shared by the private sector .
germany still not living up to its cash promises germany also pledged a whopping 137.5 million euro to the project at the time .
but the galileo project still hasn ’ t seen the money .
the eu official was hopeful that with the german elections over , germany would soon release the promised funds .
a spokesperson at the german ministry for transport , construction and housing said : " we ’ re interested in releasing the funds as soon as possible , but the orders have to come from the german government .
it could take anything from between a few weeks to a few months . "
lack of funding hurting relations with us but the official at the eu said that much damage has already been done .
" we have already lost 6 months , " he said .
but more importantly , it ’ s the loss " in terms of credibility in our relation with the us " that the eu official is more worried about .
u.s. opposition to europe ’ s development of its own navigational satellite system is no secret .
one of the united states ’ biggest concerns is security , fearing that galileo could be abused by america ’ s adversaries and offer them an alternative system .
in a letter to eu defence ministers last year , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said the eu ’ s galileo global positioning project could complicate america ’ s ability to provide satellite information to its own forces in times of crisis .
at present the u.s.-built gps which is controlled by the pentagon is the only dominant satellite navigation system in the world and america has indicated that it would like to keep it that way .
can europe really go it alone ?
europe , however , is keen to loosen its technological dependence on america and prove that it is capable of producing an equally superior civil satellite navigation system .
in a telling statement last year , french president jacques chirac said : " the united states spends six times more public money on the space sector than europe .
failure to react would inevitably lead to our countries becoming first scientific and technological vassals , then industrial and economic vassals . "
but whether europe can implement its big ideas remains to be seen .
" there ’ s a lot at risk .
we have to obtain frequencies quickly and also pay our large team of specialised engineers .
if we can ’ t even move forward with funding , i don ’ t know what the u.s. is going to think about us , " the eu official said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sharing space europe union transportation ministers have given the go-ahead to a satellite system that will make europe independent from american global positioning systems .

former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .
other teams have already shown interest . german cycling hero and 1997 tour de france champion jan ullrich has announced that he will be looking for a new team when he returns from his current six-month drug ban in march 2003 .
" after long and intensive talks over the last few weeks i have decided not to sign a new contract with team telekom , " said ullrich in an official statement on his own website .
" it was n't an easy decision to make , because i 've always felt part of the team , " he said .
" only with the support of all my telekom colleagues and the good management was it possible for me to celebrate my great successes . "
the german 's manager wolfgang strohband told bbc sport : " jan has come to the conclusion that he needs a new start .
he needs to find a new motivation in a new environment . "
no hard feelings as talismanic star moves on the resignation ends a 8-year relationship that has grown frosty over the past months following ullrich 's ban from the 2002 tour de france and subsequent admittance that he took recreational drugs at a club during a personal crisis .
team telekom boss walter godefroot said that he respected ullrich 's decision .
" he would like a change of air in order to get a new motivation , " said godefroot in an interview with radsport-news.com.
" we are parting on good terms .
i wish jan all the best for his future career . "
when asked what effect the talismanic star 's departure would have on team telekom , godefroot replied , " jan was our top rider and we would have held on to him gladly .
but we are team telekom and not team ullrich . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's ' recreational ' drug use cost him dearly this season .
new telekom contract rejected for pastures new he was expected to return to racing with the german team after the ban from the german cyling association expired next march .
team telekom said earlier this month that ullrich had been presented with a new contract for 2003 .
ullrich remained tight-lipped regarding the interest that has been shown by those bidding for his services .
" there have been offers from several teams .
i have nothing concrete to say about this at the moment . "
one of those concrete offers is thought to be from the cycling team csc tiscali , whose boss bjarne riis used to race with ullrich at team telekom .
but they may face stiff competition from rival team coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich -lrb- right -rrb- will be swapping the vivid pink for unknown team colours next season .
ullrich , 28 , has ridden for telekom ever since he turned pro in 1994 , winning his first race for them in the tour of hawaii that same year . the native of rostock , germany went on to win the tour de france in 1997 at the age of 23 , signaling what many thought was going to be a jan ullrich / telekom era of tour domination .
this year , ullrich started off on a positive note , keeping his weight down over winter and starting the season in the tour of qatar .
however after that things went completely wrong , when a knee injury flared up and refused to go away .
he was forced to renounce the tour de france and was subsequently involved in a couple of incidents that turned out to be very costly .
personal problems derail star 's bid for greatness the first was when he ran his porsche into a bike rack while under the influence of alcohol .
that led to a heavy fine and the loss of his driving licence for a year .
the second was the doping scandal that ended his 2002 season .
many thought that would be the end of ullrich 's promising career but the recent news that he is now looking for a comeback with a new team suggests there is more racing to come .
it just wo n't be in the vivid pink colours of team telekom . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live kino we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the paper , intended as a defense of blair 's strong pro-american stance , drew sharp criticism from senior iraqi officials .
schröder and blair " discussed a range of issues including iraq , afghanistan and various eu matters , " a blair spokesman told reuters , declining to go into details but insisting the atmosphere was " warm and informal " .
powell : " relationship will thrive and grow " both moves appeared to be part of a reconciliatory offensive on the part of schröder 's cabinet , and they came on the same day a russian newspaper published an interview with colin powell in which the secretary of state said that relations between the two countries continued to be " tight " and " good . " " germany is one of our closest friends , " powell told the newspaper " izvestia . " " and differences and difficulties will arise in any relationship from time to time , but the strength of the relationship between the united states and germany will remain and , i expect , will thrive and grow , " he said . the bush administration is said to be angered over statements allegedly made by german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing bush 's methods with those of hitler as well as by schröder 's steadfast refusal to support military action against iraq . in warsaw , struck proposed that germany and the netherlands could together lead the u.n.-mandated isaf peacekeeping force in afghanistan after turkey leaves the post in december . currently , 1,200 german soldiers are participating in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , and struck has proposed expanding the number of troops by deploying the german-dutch corps , a nato force comprising soldiers from both countries that is stationed in the western german city of münster . " we would be taking over additional responsibilities that i think the american government will reward , " struck told reporters . little hope for meeting with rumsfeld but he still held out little hope for a meeting with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , who publicly snubbed struck as a result of a " poisoning " of the political atmosphere between washington and berlin .
nonetheless , struck said , relations did not appear to be " seriously tense . " " i think the american government , which is attached to a long tradition of democracy , will accept the fact that we have a newly elected government that they will have to work together with well during the next four years , " struck said . rumsfeld 's snubbing of struck was particularly remarkable given that the summit represented struck 's first-ever meeting as german defense minister with his counterparts from the other nato alliance members .
struck replaced former defense minister rudolf scharping in july after his abrupt firing in july over a conflict of interest . the white house has so far refused to issue its traditional statement greeting the new german government .
on tuesday , however , state department spokesman richard boucher offered a tepid acknowledgement . " obviously , we welcome a democratic election .
voters of germany have spoken clearly through a democratic process , and we look forward to working with the german government on issues of common interest , " he said . iraq casts cloud over nato , eu-asia summits the rift in relations between the united states and germany , which reached its high point during germany 's cliffhanger election over the weekend , simmered in the background this week at two major international summits being held in copenhagen and warsaw . at the opening of the asia-europe summit in copenhagen , denmark , european commission president romano prodi sought to defuse the situation on monday by describing the hot-house atmosphere as a misinterpretation of german political culture . " if there is a poisoning of relations , then there is a misunderstanding of democracy in germany , " prodi told reporters .
" we must be prepared to work together to discuss issues publicly . "
he added that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's positions on iraq , as laid out in his election battle , should not be perceived as an " aggressive campaign " against the united states . there are few " differences of opinion " between the u.s. and europe , and right now those are primarily the establishment of the international criminal court and the question of how to resolve the diplomatic impassé with iraq . " in those areas we disagree , but that does n't mean we do n't feel deep friendship , " he said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , who is the european union 's current rotating president , has so far refused to comment on the u.s.-germany spat .
but on monday he said it would " not have the slightest effect " on eu-u.s. relations .
however , he did admit there were " nuances " in positions between european countries over iraq . french president jacqués chirac attempted to introduce a resolution at the asia-europe summit condemning the united states if it acted alone against saddam hussein .
but the proposed resolution failed to gain traction after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi rejected it , instead asking delegates to be respectful of " american sensitivities .

in november 1994 , dzenana sokolovic , 31 , and her seven-year-old son nermin divovic were fired on while walking in sarajevo .
ms sokolovic was wounded by a bullet , which passed through her and hit her son in the head , killing him .
nermin 's death is catalogued in the indictment against former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic for war crimes in bosnia .
when the bosnia phase of mr milosevic 's trial opens on thursday , the prosecution will be trying to prove the most serious charge on the book : genocide .
and it wo n't be easy .
difficult task as well as genocide , mr milosevic is indicted for crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the laws and customs of war - legal phrases which cover some of the bloodiest events of the bosnian war .
these include the siege of sarajevo , the srebrenica massacre , and the detention camps at trnopolje and omarska .
this phase of the trial will also cover incidents in croatia .
the difficulty for the prosecution will be to link these events directly to mr milosevic : that , as the indictment claims , he " planned , instigated , ordered , committed ... or otherwise aided or abetted " these war crimes .
in kosovo , covered by the first phase of the trial , mr milosevic , as yugoslav president , clearly had some authority over the yugoslav army .
whether or not he is legally responsible for the army 's activities will be up to the judge to decide .
in bosnia , the issue is a little different .
the bosnian serbs had their own leadership - radovan karadzic , their president , and his military commander , general ratko mladic .
both are under indictment for war crimes themselves , both remain at large .
mr milosevic was indisputably in close contact with the bosnian serb leadership , but the lines are much more blurred .
milosevic ' self-defence for a genocide conviction to be secured , the court has to be satisfied the defendant deliberately set out to remove an entire ethnic group .
so far , the prosecution has only secured one conviction for genocide - against general radislav krstic , one of the commanders on the ground at srebrenica in 1995 , when more than 7,000 bosnian muslim men were killed by the bosnian serb army .
none of this is likely to trouble mr milosevic .
he has refused to recognise the tribunal or the charges against him , and is conducting his own defence , including the cross-examination of witnesses .
despite his training as a lawyer , the former president seems less concerned with the legal aspects of his trial - such as disproving the evidence against him - and more with playing to the gallery , his audience in serbia .
witnesses ' credibility but the prosecution has stumbled , too .
it promised insider witnesses who would pin responsibility for kosovo directly on mr milosevic .
by no means all of them have obliged .
the former head of the serbian secret police , rade markovic , told the court his forces had strict orders to protect civilians .
in the case of one insider witness , ratomir tanic , there were serious questions about his credibility .
mr tanic changed his statement , saying at first he 'd heard mr milosevic give orders in a face-to-face meeting , then later claiming he 'd eavesdropped on one of the president 's phone conversations .
the political party to which mr tanic said he belonged denied he had ever been a member .
running behind schedule however , protected witness k-34 described in court how serb forces had orders to slaughter villagers in kosovo to " cleanse " the province of albanians .
when mr milosevic questioned his evidence , the witness , a yugoslav army private , retorted , " you were n't there - i was . "
with indictments spanning three different wars , hundreds of thousands of victims , and thousands of possible witnesses , the milosevic trial had the potential to run for years .
but the tribunal set a strict timetable .
prosecutors have until 16 may 2003 to make their case .
between now and then , they intend to call 177 witnesses , 71 for croatia , and 106 for bosnia .
but the trial is running behind schedule .
mr milosevic has fallen ill twice , causing hearings to be suspended until he recovered - in one case , for two weeks .
' kangaroo court ' however , not all the evidence will be heard in court .
this is not a jury trial ; the judge alone will decide on mr milosevic 's guilt or innocence .
the prosecution has collected written witness statements to support evidence presented in open court .
there is a lot riding on this case : not just for mr milosevic , or the tribunal , but the countries of the former yugoslavia too .
in serbia itself , coverage has been muted .
mr milosevic has played on the widespread perception that this is victors ' justice , a kangaroo court biased against serbs .
the prosecution has emphasised that it is putting an individual on trial , not an entire people .
mr milosevic has sought to create exactly the opposite impression .
even if the prosecution secures a conviction , it may never convince the people of serbia that justice has been done .

whether or not he is legally responsible for the army 's activities will be up to the judge to decide .
in bosnia , the issue is a little different .
the bosnian serbs had their own leadership - radovan karadzic , their president , and his military commander , general ratko mladic .
both are under indictment for war crimes themselves , both remain at large .
mr milosevic was indisputably in close contact with the bosnian serb leadership , but the lines are much more blurred .
milosevic ' self-defence for a genocide conviction to be secured , the court has to be satisfied the defendant deliberately set out to remove an entire ethnic group .
karadzic is still at large so far , the prosecution has only secured one conviction for genocide - against general radislav krstic , one of the commanders on the ground at srebrenica in 1995 , when more than 7,000 bosnian muslim men were killed by the bosnian serb army .
none of this is likely to trouble mr milosevic .
he has refused to recognise the tribunal or the charges against him , and is conducting his own defence , including the cross-examination of witnesses .
despite his training as a lawyer , the former president seems less concerned with the legal aspects of his trial - such as disproving the evidence against him - and more with playing to the gallery , his audience in serbia .
witnesses ' credibility but the prosecution has stumbled , too .
it promised insider witnesses who would pin responsibility for kosovo directly on mr milosevic .
by no means all of them have obliged .
the former head of the serbian secret police , rade markovic , told the court his forces had strict orders to protect civilians .
in the case of one insider witness , ratomir tanic , there were serious questions about his credibility .
mr tanic changed his statement , saying at first he 'd heard mr milosevic give orders in a face-to-face meeting , then later claiming he 'd eavesdropped on one of the president 's phone conversations .
the political party to which mr tanic said he belonged denied he had ever been a member .
running behind schedule however , protected witness k-34 described in court how serb forces had orders to slaughter villagers in kosovo to " cleanse " the province of albanians .
when mr milosevic questioned his evidence , the witness , a yugoslav army private , retorted , " you were n't there - i was . "
with indictments spanning three different wars , hundreds of thousands of victims , and thousands of possible witnesses , the milosevic trial had the potential to run for years .
but the tribunal set a strict timetable .
prosecutors have until 16 may 2003 to make their case .
between now and then , they intend to call 177 witnesses , 71 for croatia , and 106 for bosnia .
but the trial is running behind schedule .
mr milosevic has fallen ill twice , causing hearings to be suspended until he recovered - in one case , for two weeks .
' kangaroo court ' however , not all the evidence will be heard in court .
this is not a jury trial ; the judge alone will decide on mr milosevic 's guilt or innocence .
the prosecution has collected written witness statements to support evidence presented in open court .
there is a lot riding on this case : not just for mr milosevic , or the tribunal , but the countries of the former yugoslavia too .
in serbia itself , coverage has been muted .
mr milosevic has played on the widespread perception that this is victors ' justice , a kangaroo court biased against serbs .
the prosecution has emphasised that it is putting an individual on trial , not an entire people .
mr milosevic has sought to create exactly the opposite impression .
even if the prosecution secures a conviction , it may never convince the people of serbia that justice has been done .

jimmy luu , an employee of microcache computer , who won the bidding for the big e , said his boss had told him to " do anything " to get it .
bidding on the houston e had opened at $ 500 .
but bargains were thin on the ground as the scandal of enron 's fall from us corporate darling to bankrupt energy firm pushed up the price of otherwise unremarkable office equipment .

obasanjo was heavily criticised for negotiating with the abacha family swiss justice ministry officials are quoted as saying the deal has fallen through because general abacha 's son , mohammed , has not signed vital legal papers releasing the money .
the extraordinary out-of-court agreement between nigeria and general abacha 's bereaved family was reached in may .
it was agreed the general 's family could keep $ 100 million provided that his son signed an agreement enabling foreign banks in switzerland and elsewhere to return to nigeria a further $ 1 billion of allegedly looted money .
embarrassment the deal was apparently linked to the release from prison this week of mohammed abacha , ending his three-year period behind bars on charges of embezzlement .
suspicions that the deal might be going awry arose on wednesday when jubilant mohammed was quoted as saying that - despite his release - he had made no commitment to sign anything .
now the increasingly embarrassed swiss authorities have acknowledged that they have received no signed papers , and therefore are in no position to hand over any of the abacha family fortune to nigeria .
throughout this long affair , nigerian president obasanjo has faced a no-win situation .
he was condemned by one side for negotiating any deal with the abachas .
at the same time , mr abacha 's supporters slammed the president for detaining the general 's son for so long on what they say are spurious charges .

rhondda cynon taff council had previously refused to disclose the files concerning its actions over fresh allegations earlier this year in the john owen inquiry .
the hearing this week has been hearing evidence from ex-pupils of ysgol gyfun rhydfelen , in pontypridd , claiming they were forced to dance naked at practical exams and from one who alleged she was raped .
the children 's commissioner for wales , peter clarke , hopes the unpublished documentation will be handed over by council officials .
the documentation is expected to shed light on what disciplinary action , if any , was taken against three teachers who were investigated in connection with the clywch inquiry .
the teachers were investigated by the police but no charges were brought .
mr clarke - who oversees the welfare of children in wales - hopes his inquiry will take a step forward with the disclosure of the council 's files .
earlier on wednesday , a woman alleged mr owen raped her in a private room after she refused to perform a sex act during an a-level practical examination .
the woman , who can not be named , cried as she told the resumed clywch inquiry how mr owen had constantly spoken of sexual matters and picked on her during drama lessons at pontypridd ysgol gyfun rhydfelen .
mr owen - an award-winning children 's tv writer and former head of drama at the south wales valleys school - killed himself last year the day before he was due in court to face five charges of indecency against children .
the woman 's evidence comes after the father of a man who claims he was abused by mr owen , accused the authorities of trying to cover-up the teacher 's activities .
the woman witness said she had been so ashamed of the rape which happened when she was 17 , that she had told no one about it .
but she had told senior teachers of her concerns about the practical examination when she decided to drop drama , she said .
it was also revealed on wednesday that four senior teachers at the school had signed a letter 11 years ago warning of the psychological damage mr owen was inflicting on a number of pupils at the school .
the letter was addressed to local authority officials .
the inquiry 's barrister , nicholas cooke , said that because one official was not willing to testify to the inquiry , it was impossible at this stage to ascertain what further action , if any , was taken .
on tuesday , the father of one of the witnesses claimed mr owen 's alleged abuse of pupils had been covered up by the chair and vice-chair of governors at ysgol gyfun rhydfelen .
the parent said the school 's management team had been intent on protecting the good name of the campus and of welsh-medium education .
the inquiry heard evidence from four parents , whose children allege they were sexually or physically abused by mr owen .
the issue first came to light when four of mr owen 's former pupils came forward with abuse allegations dating back to the 1970s .
mr owen was subsequently charged with five counts of indecency with boys between 1974 and 1991 .
