the fast-food giant is closing 130 of its japanese outlets this year while opening just 220 , the nihon keizai shimbun newspaper reported .
although that still results in net growth for the restaurant chain in 2002 , it is well below the pace of expansion envisaged earlier .
over the past five years , the firm has increased its network by a net 250-450 restaurants every year .
when shares in mcdonald 's japan were floated in tokyo last july , the firm said it was on course to triple its branch network , with new restaurants in schools , hospitals and even on the famous bullet train .
meat mauled part of the reason for mcdonald 's slowing growth has been japan 's stuttering economy .
all retailers have been hit by the slowdown , and some high-profile high street names have gone bust .
but far more dangerous for mcdonald 's has been the dramatic spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or mad cow disease , which broke out last september .
the bse crisis has sparked a collapse in beef sales , and mcdonald 's japan reported its fifth consecutive monthly fall in turnover in february .
change of management the company seems to be rethinking its strategy more generally .
until february , it aimed to compete aggressively on cost , with a wave of half-price offers .
but as sales dropped , the price campaign was ended , and den fujita , the company president who masterminded the strategy , is to step down at the end of this month .

an outdoor activities awareness forum was meeting for the first time at the storey arms in the brecon beacons , mid wales .
a range of mountaineering , sports and tourism experts will consider the issues and make recommendations to the welsh culture minister jenny randerson .
the forum was created in response to a series of incidents , including the death of a 10-year-old boy during a scout trip to snowdonia , north wales .
jonathan atwell , from bristol , fell 500ft to his death while at the back of a group hiking along the east ridge of snowdon in october 1999 .
former scoutmaster peter finlay , 51 , was cleared of manslaughter following a trial in caernarfon , north wales , in october 2001 .
risk awareness a snowdonia national park warden told the court the route was inappropriate for inexperienced walkers .
the case prompted the scout association to revise its guidelines on adventure activities .
an assembly debate on safety concerns was called by labour am alan pugh , followed by an emergency statement from ms randerson .
she announced the setting up of a forum to decide how best to warn the public about the risks involved in outdoor activities , and the need to be well prepared .
ms randerson said that while many participants may be attracted by the danger factor , positive action should be taken to reduce the number of accidents .
a week after the death of jonathan atwell on snowdon , scout leader christopher oliver , 35 , died after falling on nearby cader idris .
there has also been a series of deaths involving divers at the flooded dorothea quarry , also in snowdonia .
safety warnings the forum is chaired by iain peter , chief executive of the mountain training trust at plas-y-brenin , north wales .
he said the aim was to improve public awareness about safety issues , not to stop anyone enjoying outdoor pursuits .
" the great thing about being a mountaineer in britain is that there are hardly any limits or regulations as to what you can do .
" what i would like to see is that if people want to go in jeans , they 're aware of all the dangers that involves .
" if they choose to carry on , then on their own head be it . "
mr peter added that people ought to be prepared to spend money on appropriate training .
" people do n't mind paying £ 1,000 to learn how to use a computer , and they do n't mind paying £ 300 for a good waterproof jacket .
" but they do object to paying £ 150 for two days with board and accommodation to learn how to navigate . "
the forum includes representatives from groups such as the sports council for wales , the mountain rescue committee , the wales tourist board and the welsh canoe association .
it will draw up a preliminary report with their recommendations by november 2002 .

the firm , formed two years ago from the merger of the main french , german and spanish aerospace companies , said underlying pre-tax profit rose a better-than-expected 21 % to 1.7bn euros -lrb- £ 1.1bn ; $ 1.5bn -rrb- last year .
the vast majority of that increase was due to gains from foreign exchange rates , and the consolidation of its airbus stake in its overall accounts .
and while the firm said that aircraft demand last year had been strong , sales and profits would suffer this year as the effects of the 11 september attacks filter through into its order books .
aircraft take off airbus was the firm 's main source of growth , helping to push net profit up to 1.4bn euros , compared with a 909m euro net loss in 2000 , when the firm was hit by a huge charge relating to hedging transactions .
airbus has performed strongly in recent years , nibbling away market share from us rival boeing , which it now leads in certain markets .
aside from airbus , eads 's other divisions were more or less static .
the firm 's space activities , which include the recently launched envisat satellite , have been hard hit by competition from the us .
and its defence arm , seen as a crucial hedge against slowing demand for civilian aircraft , has also been hampered by tightening military budgets in europe .

switzerland has long had a shady reputation when it comes to dirty money .
with about a third of the private banking deposits in the whole world resting in the coffers of its banks , and a reputation for financial discretion second to none , the bad rap is inescapable .
the upshot is that in recent years switzerland has been determined to be seen to clean up its image .
when the billions stolen by nigeria 's late dictator sani abacha were being traced , swiss regulators financiers were - to the surprise of many - much keener than their london colleagues to root them out , and to make the whole story as public as possible .
the consequences -lrb- of 11 september -rrb- have changed our lives patrick moulette financial action task force and in november 2000 , they found - and froze - $ 50m of assets belonging to disgraced former peruvian intelligence chief vlademiro montesinos .
but even that apparent determination had its weaknesses .
earlier the same year , the chief executive of the main national anti-money laundering body resigned along with his deputy , frustrated at a backlog of more than 500 cases , a critical shortage of staff and resources , and the lack of sufficient powers to do the job .
before and after a similar situation has prevailed in most of the world 's money laundering centres .
three independent experts contacted by bbc news online agreed that even taking into account the huge difficulties faced by law enforcement and regulators in tracking money launderers , many governments have proved half-hearted at best when stumping up the necessary funding .
british policemen , both serving and ex-officers working in financial intelligence , have complained to bbc news online that interdiction of money laundering has been about style rather than substance .
and despite having by far the biggest and most effective operation in the world , even the us has often found itself facing a huge and unmanageable mound of suspicious transaction reports .
zurich , switzerland 's banking centre , is a favourite for dirty money but the tragic events of 11 september changed that .
regulators and law enforcement saw their needs shoot up the official priority lists as the hunt for terrorist finance - until then something of a backwater - took on a new urgency .
hungary , which had hitherto been dragging its feet about scrapping its system of bank accounts with anonymous passbook , ditched it almost overnight .
the uk 's national crime squad now has a national head of financial intelligence - a task that previously was devolved to the regional crime squads and the 40-plus individual police forces , who were ill-equipped to handle the investigations ..
in the us , a multi-agency team of 30 people , led by an expert from the customs service , has traced the finances of virtually everyone directly implicated in the 11 september atrocity .
the usa patriot act both awarded new money to the task at hand and updated general us anti-money laundering legislation , which - surprisingly - was some way below international standards .
small office , big job for patrick moulette , executive secretary of the small group charged by industrialised countries with the job of overseeing international money laundering policy , the outcome was a workload which doubled overnight .
" the consequences -lrb- of 11 september -rrb- have changed our lives , " he told bbc news online .
his tiny office on the first floor of a converted apartment block in western paris became the focus for drawing up new advice for law enforcement and the financial sector in how to spot money destined to fund terrorism .
the financial action task force , as his group is known , has spent the past six months shaping eight new recommendations , getting the 30-odd member states to assess how their procedures stood up to them , and getting plans written to bring everyone - including about 60 non-members - up to spec by june this year .
" the political pressure is much higher than ever , " he said .
hungary revised its laws within weeks of 11 september " there were a number of calls from the international community - the international monetary fund , the g8 - to take up this issue .
" there was a short debate - a very short debate - on whether a new organisation was needed .
" but although terrorist finance is not the same as money laundering , it 's close , and there was the risk of duplicating expertise , authority and credibility " , says mr moulette .
the speed with which countries around the world have been galvanised is reflected in a united nations convention little-known before 11 september .
before then , the un convention on suppressing the financing of terrorism had been ratified by just four countries .
now dozens have put the wheels in motion to sign up - including such unlikely candidates as north korea .
named and shamed the lists of territories and countries deemed to be " non-cooperative " - including the philippines , when it comes to money laundering - have taken on a new meaning , too .
while mr moulette is at pains to point out that the lists it has been publishing for a decade are about money laundering , rather than terrorist finance , the new linkage means that the chances of meaningful sanctions against such transgressors have improved dramatically .

just one of the ways , he said , that the push against terrorist finance is helping the anti-money laundering campaign - although there remains the risk that it will get pushed down the queue .
" i hope the trend -lrb- of delivering a higher profile -rrb- will continue - although we must remember that the two things are not always the same , " he said .
" it would be very dangerous to forget the pre-existing issues . "
slow progress but even with the new publicity , the added impetus , the avowed determination at the highest levels of national and international government , there are still big problems to surmount .

the same hurdles have been found in many individual countries .
the will may be there , but the political wheels grind slow .
" when i talk to people , we all have the same impression : we are much more busy , but support from governments and the various international organisations has been slow , " he said . "

instead , diplomats and analysts are asking if the military government 's moves against a prominent family may signal a wider willingness for change .
it 's a step in the direction of reform rather than a retreat to the past un official about 100 senior soldiers and police are still being questioned about the alleged coup , according to military sources in rangoon .
these are believed to be the people whose names appeared on a list that was drawn up by sandar win , the daughter of the former military leader general ne win .
four senior officers have already been sacked , including two regional commanders .
many more arrests and sackings are expected in the next few weeks .
although only ne win 's son-in-law , aye zaw win , and his three sons have been detained , privately the military have made it clear that they believe that sandar win is in fact the ring leader .
brigadier general kyaw win told journalists that if evidence was unearthed which implicated her , then she would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law .
so far they have not hinted whether they thought general ne win , now in his 90s , had been involved .
despite the government 's carefully orchestrated show-down with the ne win family , there is increasing scepticism in burma surrounding the allegations of a plot to overthrow the government .
there is no doubt that the ne win family were trying to re-establish some of the power and influence the family name used to wield in burmese politics , and that they felt they were not getting the perks and privileges they thought they were due .
sandar win even consulted a soothsayer who told her that the ne win family empire would never re-emerge " over the past 18 months sandar win and her children have been increasingly side-lined , " said a western diplomat in rangoon who did not want to be identified .
" they were growing increasingly bitter and often complained that the government had turned against them . "
sandar win even consulted a soothsayer who told her that the ne win family empire would never re-emerge .
" this seems to have sent her into a mad frenzy , " said a source close to the family .
there is also no doubt that the ne win off-spring then began to canvass support among as many senior ranking soldiers as they could .
" but this is a far cry from trying to organise a physical take-over of power , " said an asian diplomat .
car scam so far those who have been sacked have all been connected to the family through business interests .
one of them , brigadier general chit than , the regional commander of the golden triangle area which borders china and thailand , was axed because he allowed the family to import cars from thailand without import licences , according to a senior military source .
observers in rangoon believe that the top generals are using the antics of the ne win family as a pretext to root out some of the senior officers who are guilty of excessive corruption .
this was a process that began last november with the sacking of two top generals and five government ministers .
burma 's south east asian neighbours have all been telling the regime it needs to liberalise the economy and curb corruption if the country is to develop .
this is one of the key issues the un special envoy to burma razali ismail has been stressing to the ruling junta on his frequent visits to rangoon .
initially the move against the ne win family was seen as part of a power struggle within the military , particularly on the issue the confidential talks between the regime and the opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
but the generals have been at pains to say that it will not affect the dialogue process .
in fact un officials are encouraged by these developments and believe they may even hasten progress in the talks .
" the generals have now taken a totally unexpected step and done something which most people - inside and outside the country - would never have dreamt they would do , " said a un official who declined to be identified .
" it 's a step in the direction of reform rather than a retreat to the past , " he said .
" if they can do that , they can do anything , releasing aung san suu kyi from house arrest should be easy now . "
on the streets of rangoon , the fall of general ne win 's family has been met by muted euphoria .
many people now hope that the generals may act just as decisively on the issue of political reform .

" the generals have now taken a totally unexpected step and done something which most people - inside and outside the country - would never have dreamt they would do , " said a un official who declined to be identified .
" it 's a step in the direction of reform rather than a retreat to the past , " he said .
" if they can do that , they can do anything , releasing aung san suu kyi from house arrest should be easy now . "
on the streets of rangoon , the fall of general ne win 's family has been met by muted euphoria .
many people now hope that the generals may act just as decisively on the issue of political reform .
