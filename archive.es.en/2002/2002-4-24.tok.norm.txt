jorge remes lenicov has quit following a decision by argentine politicians to delay a vote on his last-ditch package for preventing a collapse in the country 's banking system .
he also failed in meetings to secure loans from the international monetary fund to tackle argentina 's grave economic crisis . "
whereas the bond plan was going to be really grim for the man on the street , it was generally seen as the orthodox way out of a really nightmarish situation " ben laidler , ubs warburg bank in buenos aires , therefore , it feels like 2001 all over again .
the banks are closed , the people are on the streets , and the government is - yet again - in turmoil .
all in all , thoroughly reminiscent of the end of last year , when argentina went through four presidents in as many weeks .
giving up mr remes lenicov 's plan to convert savings to bonds met with scorn from the public , who had gathered earlier on tuesday outside the upper house of argentina 's parliament to register their unease at the progress of economic reform .
he had proposed allowing argentine banks to convert about 60 % of deposits into government bonds - in effect forcing people to lend money to a government they do not trust to pay up .
protesters responded by dubbing the proposed securities " mafia bonds " . "
mr remes lenicov must realise the devaluation , which was his bright idea , has been an appalling failure " james neilson , political analyst argentines were told that banks , closed since the weekend , would remain shut until friday , when congress was set to have completed its debate of the proposed legal changes .
the bank closures were ordered to prevent panic withdrawals by account holders who , rightly , feared that high-level talks to restart aid payments to argentina would fail .
that could well have triggered a domino-like collapse in the banking sector .
the account holders were also spooked by the rapidly falling value of the country 's currency , the peso .
anger the move to close the banks partially succeeded , in that the withdrawals were indeed stopped .
but the public mood turned sour when president eduardo duhalde promised the international monetary fund that he would push ahead with economic and legal reforms and a serious belt-tightening exercise .
thousands of argentines took to the streets on monday , raising fears of a return of the kind of unrest which prompted president fernando de la rua to resign in december .
reaction no-one yet knows who will replace mr remes lenicov , although energy and mines secretary alieto guadagni has said mr duhalde has offered him the job .
mr remes lenicov , a long-time political partner of mr duhalde , was welcomed as a low-profile , calm and non-confrontational economy minister following the reign of his flamboyant predecessor , domingo cavallo . "
if -lsb- the new economy minister is -rsb- energy secretary alieto guadagni , the market will take it as something positive " rafael ber , analyst argentine research but mr remes lenicov 's decision to allow the continued slide in the peso provoked disquiet .
" he must realise the devaluation , which was his bright idea , has been an appalling failure , " said political analyst james neilson .
confidence in mr remes lenicov was severely undermined when he returned empty handed from talks with the imf .
and concerns over the deposits-for-bonds swap proved the final straw .
" it 's essentially a reflection of the failure of his bonds plan , " said ben laidler , argentine equity strategist at ubs warburg , who described the resignation as " bad news " .
" whereas the bond plan was going to be really grim for the man on the street , it was generally seen as the orthodox way out of a really nightmarish situation . "
rafael ber , an analyst at argentine research said the investor reaction to the resignation would depend much on who was chosen to replace mr remes .
" how the market reacts depends on who it is .
if it 's energy secretary alieto guadagni , the market will take it as something positive . "

meti 's monthly all-industry index for march crept up 0.5 % from february , but the index which measures services fell 0.4 % .

mislabelling of goods by some suppliers and an apparent lack of interest by government in dealing with the outbreak has harmed confidence .

my impression is that overall , economic activity seems sluggish , " said meti current statistics division director kazuaki hasegawa .
the index is seen as an indicator for economic growth in general .
japan has had three quarters of contraction , and observers hope that the industrial figures - industrial production rose 1.2 % in february - will outweigh the trouble in the service sector .

taiwan is an island where typhoons in the summer months bring widespread flooding and often cause many deaths .

in many areas the use of swimming pools and car washes has been banned and officials are warning that normal water supplies could soon be reduced .
since the beginning of the year some parts of the island have only seen 16 % of the average rainfall for this time of year .
water levels in reservoirs have been dropping sharply , and irrigation to some rice paddies in the north has been stopped to ensure enough water reaches a key high-tech industrial park , home to some of the island 's major electronics companies .
some officials have resorted to praying at temples asking the gods to bring more rain .
the government is building more reservoirs and plans to build more seawater desalination plants but until they are completed all the government can do , like everyone else , is pray for the heavens to open .

on tuesday it heard evidence from one of the last people to see him before he was kidnapped .
two police officers also testified that they heard the main suspect , british-born militant , ahmed omar saeed sheikh , admitting his role in the kidnapping .
on monday omar sheikh and the three other accused declared themselves innocent of the charges .
mr pearl disappeared in karachi in january while researching muslim extremism and afterwards a video was sent to us diplomats showing him being killed although his body has not been found .
originally , the trial was expected to be completed within a week although the process could now take longer than initially assumed .
telephone calls on tuesday the court heard evidence from one of the last people to have met mr pearl before he disappeared .
the man , yusuf jamil of the citizens police liaison committee , described how mr pearl had come to his office on the day of his abduction .
he said he heard mr pearl tell a caller on his mobile phone that he , mr pearl , would soon meet them .
shortly afterwards , mr pearl vanished after arriving outside a karachi restaurant .
mr jamil said when mrs mariane pearl called a few days later to inquire after her husband , he advised her to get her husband 's mobile phone bill which would show who had called him twice while mr pearl was in mr jamil 's office .
mr jamil added that mrs pearl later told him the number from which those two calls were made belonged to imtiaz siddiqe , one of seven other people the police are now looking for .
he said she told him this number had earlier been e-mailed to her husband by mohammad bashir , a name police say was at the time being used as an alias by omar sheikh himself .
retracted statement the court also heard from two pakistani police officers , athar rashid and faisal noor , who had attended a hearing in february at which omar sheikh said he believed mr pearl was dead .
according to a defence attorney khawaja naveed , the two officers said omar sheikh had said he had masterminded mr pearl 's abduction , that he would not defend himself and that mr pearl was dead .
however , omar sheikh did not make that statement under oath , later retracting it , and defence lawyers say it should not be admissible in the hearings at all .
the trial , held behind closed doors in a makeshift courtroom at karachi central jail , is taking place amid massive security .
omar sheikh 's father saeed sheikh , who has been allowed to attend the hearings , said he had met his son before the proceedings began , and that omar sheikh wished to pass on a message .
this was a warning that those who oppressed muslims would have to face the " wrath of god " .
the hearings resume on wednesday when the prosecution says it will call another 10 witnesses .

mr jamil added that mrs pearl later told him the number from which those two calls were made belonged to imtiaz siddiqe , one of seven other people the police are now looking for .
he said she told him this number had earlier been e-mailed to her husband by mohammad bashir , a name police say was at the time being used as an alias by omar sheikh himself .
retracted statement the court also heard from two pakistani police officers , athar rashid and faisal noor , who had attended a hearing in february at which omar sheikh said he believed mr pearl was dead .
according to a defence attorney khawaja naveed , the two officers said omar sheikh had said he had masterminded mr pearl 's abduction , that he would not defend himself and that mr pearl was dead .
however , omar sheikh did not make that statement under oath , later retracting it , and defence lawyers say it should not be admissible in the hearings at all .
the trial , held behind closed doors in a makeshift courtroom at karachi central jail , is taking place amid massive security .
omar sheikh 's father saeed sheikh , who has been allowed to attend the hearings , said he had met his son before the proceedings began , and that omar sheikh wished to pass on a message .
this was a warning that those who oppressed muslims would have to face the " wrath of god " .

childline scotland said they received more than 900 calls from children and young people who mentioned problems with the death of a loved one in 2001 .
of those , about 150 phoned specifically to talk about bereavement , the charity said .
one in four of these callers to the 24-hour service said they were being physically or sexually abused or neglected after someone close to them had died .
anne houston : called for a national strategy a report published on wednesday by the charity said there was a significant connection .
one in 20 of all children who called the helpline because of abuse or neglect added that they had also suffered a bereavement .
the report said many young people believed their ill-treatment was related to the surviving parent 's inability to cope .
frequently the child 's father or mother had been drinking heavily since their partner died , the report said .
in some instances , the death of a carer had removed the child 's protector - which was usually the mother - and the abuser had seized an opportunity that had not previously existed .
' additional factor ' about a fifth of those wanting to discuss bereavement talked about the death of a parent and a fifth also said that they had been affected by the violent death of a relative .
anne houston , director of childline scotland , said : " obviously bereavement puts huge stress on families .
" we know that physical abuse is more likely to happen in a family under a great deal of pressure that would be caused by the death of a loved one .
" with sexual abuse if it is the mother that has died then it could be the case that the father will look to a child for physical comfort , and that turns into abuse .
" we also have to recognise that abuse has been present before the bereavement in many cases , but the death has acted as an additional factor . "
she called for a national strategy to provide services for bereaved children and their parents and carers . watch / listen on this story anne houston , childline scotland " around one in four children mentioned they had been abused in some way " see also : 28 mar 02 -pipe- scotland surge in scots child abuse cases 25 jul 01 -pipe- scotland abuse case prompts reform calls 25 may 01 -pipe- scotland pet cruelty study ' warning ' 15 feb 01 -pipe- education charity says teachers might not spot abuse 31 aug 00 -pipe- uk child abuse risk for sports clubs 21 jun 00 -pipe- scotland four-year-olds call abuse line internet links : children 1st childline the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top scotland stories now : new powers call for donor cards girl 's death sparks major inquiry north sea rig hit by explosion killer faces wife assault charge rapist jailed over murder bid scots killed in alps fall national park ' goes live ' security van raid tip-off links to more scotland stories are at the foot of the page .
