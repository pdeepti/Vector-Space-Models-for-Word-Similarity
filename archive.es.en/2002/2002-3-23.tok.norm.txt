at a joint news conference , president george w bush and his mexican counterpart , vicente fox , said they did not put any pressure on the cuban leader .
fidel castro can do what he wants - what i 'm uncomfortable about is the way he treats his people george bush the conference , which ended on friday , committed richer nations to giving more aid to poorer countries in return for better governance .
but the outcome of the summit is in danger of being overshadowed by the castro question - did he go or was he pushed ?
quick visit the cuban leader made a brief appearance at the summit on thursday , staying just long enough to attack world capitalism before abruptly leaving .
later , cuban officials said he had been asked to go by mexico under pressure from the us - a charge a decidedly testy-looking president fox has now denied .
castro stayed long enough for a quick attack on world capitalism " mr fidel castro visited mexico .
he was here , he participated in the conference , and he returned to cuba - nothing more , " said mr fox .
president bush , who is said to have been uncomfortable at the idea of having to share a room with the cuban leader , also denied any hand in his departure .
" i know of no pressure placed on anybody , " he said .
" fidel castro can do what he wants to do .
what i 'm uncomfortable about is the way he treats his people .
there 's only one country that 's not a democracy in our hemisphere and that 's cuba . "
the two presidents were clearly happier talking about us / mexican relations , announcing agreements on tightening border security and on measures to stem the flow of migrants to america by improving economic opportunities in mexico .
but the two leaders have still not reached agreement over what to do about the millions of mexicans already living in the us illegally .
will the rich do more ?

two years have passed since cyanide and heavy metals from romanian mines devastated life in the tisza river .
scientists co-operate closely to monitor the state of the rivers , but are asking their governments to do more to enforce existing laws to protect the environment .
" let the rivers run free and clean " is the title of the conference in tirgu mures .
environmentalists from romania , hungary , slovakia and ukraine have been working closely together for the past decade , gathering and publishing details of the flora and fauna of the many rivers flowing down from the carpathian mountains .
gravel extraction this conference is a chance to pool their experiences and appeal to the governments and water management authorities , who are also taking part in the conference , to prevent further disruption .
the problems of the rivers , highlighted by the cyanide and heavy metal spills two years ago , are enormous .
gravel and sand extraction have scraped the riverbed down to the bedrock in places , speeding up the flow of rivers and leaving little for fish to feed on .
deforestation in ukraine and romania cause floods each spring .
waste from mines and other industries and nutrients from sewage and agriculture also cause serious harm .
on the positive side , the desire of all the countries in the region to join the european union means they all feel the outside pressure to raise environmental standards .
but the cost often makes this difficult .
the environmentalists meeting in tirgu mures hope that increased public awareness of the problems at home and abroad will help save this still beautiful but badly damaged region .

day two : after thursday 's travel frenzy , friday settled into a pattern all too familiar to veterans of presidential trips .
i call it the filing room blues .
on every trip the president takes , no matter how long or short , the white house sets up a room for the journalists to do their thing .
these rooms always look the same whether they 're in asia , europe , africa or in this case latin america .
they 're invariably large rooms in posh hotels , and for some reason they always have brownish walls and sleepy soft lighting .
exam atmosphere i do n't know whether it 's some kind of psychological warfare programme by the white house but i always find the effect of these rooms very dispiriting .
the atmosphere is a bit like sitting a school exam but with coffee allowed .
the journalists sit at their spots on the long tables tapping away , occasionally looking up for inspiration .
those writing the most and without too many of those upward looks are regarded as the class swots .
as to the business at hand - covering the president 's trip to latin america - it 's been a tough exam .
not because the assembled journalists had n't revised enough , but rather because they felt they 'd already sat the exam last week when the president first announced his " more cash for less corruption " approach to world poverty .
many , and here i get to a serious point , were also having trouble selling the story to their editors back across the border .
some were frustrated .
their argument goes like this : " the poverty and political chaos in some countries is in part what causes so many people from those countries to want to come to the united states , most to work but some possibly for more sinister reasons .
surely that is an interesting story for the american people ? "
" hardcore bush-watchers among the white house press corps are ever on the alert for a ' bushism ' " their argument failed .
as far as i know , not one of three national tv networks covered the president 's anti-poverty policy on their main evening news broadcasts .
but it was n't all doom and gloom .
another feature of " filing room life " is " filing room buffet " .
without having to move more than a few yards from the filing room , food is always at hand - breakfast , lunch , dinner and snacks in between .
award-winning guacamole and while mexican food is hardly a rarity for your average american journalist , there 's been universal agreement that the guacamole here is of award-winning quality .
so memo to the white house travel office , keep the guacamole coming .
aside from the green stuff , the main event for white house press corps was the president 's joint news conference with his mexican counterpart , vicente fox .
part of the reason for that is - contrary to any romantic ideals of covering presidential visits - you do n't tend to get a lot of downtime chatting with the man himself , so a news conference is about as close as you 'll get .
from the president 's point of view , the message he wanted to get out was the f word - friendship that is .
like a popular schoolboy , president bush has been anxious to assure president fox and the mexican people that their leader is still his best friend despite some concerns south of the border that the position was now occupied by prime minister tony blair since 11 september .
but for hardcore bush-watchers among the white house press corps , ever on the alert for a " bushism " , the line that stole the show was his reference to the revered new yorker , as " some east coast magazine " .
given that most members of the press corps regard it as required reading for the intelligentsia , it was , one of them told me , " further evidence of the president 's cultural detachment " .
time to bring out more guacamole i think .

the national secretary of the transport and general workers ' union , jack dromey , said workers on britain 's naval bases would " stand as one " if there were compulsory redundancies . "
we will fight to save every job and resist compulsory redundancies .
if necessary , there will be industrial action " jack dromey tgwu it is understood half the job losses , thought to be included in the government 's warship review , will be among staff at scottish naval bases .
another 3,000 workers are likely to see their positions privatised under the plans .
speaking on bbc radio 5 mr dromey said : " we hope that even at this late stage ministers will see reason and put defence before dogma . "
mr dromey said he wanted " cast iron guarantees " that there would be no forced redundancies and no change in conditions for workers transferred to other shipyards .
an announcement on the plans is due in the commons on monday .
a ministry of defence spokesman declined to confirm or deny the job losses , claiming it is merely speculation .
' overcapacity ' bbc scotland 's westminster correspondent david porter said an estimated 1,400 workers will be affected north of the border .
unions have mounted a vociferous campaign against the proposals which would see catering , cleaning and operational support staff all transferred to private companies .
the mod spokesman said : " there is overcapacity which does need to be addressed to get the level of maintenance and refits that the royal navy needs at the best value for money for the taxpayer , " he said .
" on that basis we have been looking carefully at the proposals put forward by the industry and the trade unions .
" certainly if we go down the partnership route the interests of the workers will be fully protected .
" we need an efficient and cost-effective way forward now that there are fewer vessels needing to be maintained . "
mr dromey said privatisation was not the answer .
he said : " this jobs bombshell is devastating news for workers .
" we will fight to save every job and resist compulsory redundancies .
if necessary , there will be industrial action .
" there is a problem of over-capacity but we proposed a positive public sector alternative to use the skills and spare capacity rather than slash jobs . "
ministers had rejected a reasonable alternative in favour of privatisation , he added .
' insane ' privatisation earlier this month , workers at the faslane base staged a protest over the prospect of their jobs being privatised .
unions are worried that this could mean work being contracted out to the private sector , resulting in the loss of up to 1,800 jobs in scotland and a total of 3,000 in the uk .
faslane employees have warned that they will move towards taking industrial action if the government insists on advancing towards privatisation .
in february , a delegation of employees from the three bases at faslane , portsmouth and devonport lobbied defence secretary geoff hoon .
they also handed in petitions at 10 downing street and pressed the prime minister to put a halt to the " insane " privatisation plans .

in february , a delegation of employees from the three bases at faslane , portsmouth and devonport lobbied defence secretary geoff hoon .
they also handed in petitions at 10 downing street and pressed the prime minister to put a halt to the " insane " privatisation plans . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's helen simms " unions will fight any cull to the workforce " the bbc 's john morrison " the unions are absolutely devastated " see also : 22 mar 02 -pipe- england navy to cut dock jobs 07 mar 02 -pipe- scotland naval workers walk out 12 dec 00 -pipe- scotland unions urge faslane rethink 04 aug 00 -pipe- scotland ' private ' nuclear base claim denied internet links : royal navy the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top scotland stories now : new powers call for donor cards girl 's death sparks major inquiry north sea rig hit by explosion killer faces wife assault charge rapist jailed over murder bid scots killed in alps fall national park ' goes live ' security van raid tip-off links to more scotland stories are at the foot of the page .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- pill increases breast cancer risk categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 23 march , 2002 , 08:40 gmt pill increases breast cancer risk older women are most at risk from the pill women who have taken the contraceptive pill at any stage in their lives have a slightly increased chance of developing breast cancer , research shows .
their risk rose by just over a quarter -lrb- 26 % -rrb- , compared with women who had never used the pill .
this is slightly higher than previous studies have estimated .
the latest research showed those who had taken the pill over longer periods increased their risk of breast cancer by 58 % compared with those who never used it .
it is clear that oral contraceptives increase a woman 's risk of developing breast cancer dr merethe kumle , study co-ordinator however , the highest increased risk -lrb- 144 % -rrb- was among women aged over 45 who were still using the pill .
dr merethe kumle , who carried out the research , said : " it is clear that oral contraceptives increase a woman 's risk of developing breast cancer , particularly when they are used in the later period of reproductive life . "
the study , presented at the third european breast cancer conference in barcelona , used data collected from 103,000 women aged between 30 and 49 .
dr kumle from the institute of community medicine in tromso , norway , collaborated with researchers in sweden and france to assess data from the women 's lifestyle and health study carried out in norway and sweden .
the women were originally contacted in 1991/92 and followed through to december 1999 .
during that time , 1,008 cases of breast cancer had been detected .
most of the women who had taken the pill had used the more modern brands that are currently prescribed by doctors .
lower dose pills dr kumle stressed the pill also has health benefits .
she said : " oral contraceptives have a lot of advantages as well as disadvantages .
" the total number of deaths from any cause among women who use oral contraceptives is likely to be lower than women who have never used the pill - just as with hormone replacement therapy . "
she added : " the pill has made it possible for women to decide when and how many children they will give birth to - something which has revolutionised women 's lives and is an important issue in women 's rights . "
the absolute risk of a woman developing breast cancer under the age of 40 is very low , says dr kumle .
she also stressed that modern oral contraceptives have much lower hormone doses in them than the older ones , which caused an unacceptably high number of adverse effects .
professor valerie beral , who is head of cancer research uk 's cancer epidemiology unit in oxford , said this study was in line with previous research , although the figures differed .
she said : " we have done a study of 54,000 women with breast cancer and found there is a small increased risk of developing the disease from taking the pill .
breast cancer trends " we found a 24 % increase in risk while women were currently taking the pill .
" however the risk fell away to the same as women who had never taken the pill , within 10 years of them discontinuing its use . "
the incidence of breast cancer has been rising in western countries over the past 30 years .
the use of oral contraceptives is one reason , but girls starting their periods earlier , women having fewer and later births , later menopause and a tendency to being overweight are also influential .
dr kumle said : " we found a slightly increased risk of breast cancer among users of the pill , but it is important to underline that young women using the pill are not playing hazard with their health .
" as contraception , the pill should still be the drug of choice for young women . "

europe is about to make a final decision on whether or not to proceed with a network of navigational satellites called galileo .
bbc news online looks at the pros and cons of having a rival to the us-built global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
what is galileo ?
galileo is a global network of 30 satellites that will be run by europe .
the satellites will be used as a navigational network for ships , planes , cars and lorries , and spacecraft .
positioning satellites transmit signals which , when picked up on the ground , allow someone to pinpoint their exact location on a map .
with galileo , you would be able to do this with accuracy down to one metre .
the system would also used to provide surveying references for building roads , bridges and cities .
in future , the satellite network should have many other applications as well , such as in new personalised services for mobile phone and pocket computer users .
where does current information come from ?
there are two satellite positioning systems already in use .
one is the global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- run by the united states .
the other is the russian network , known as glonass .
both have military applications and there is no guarantee of an uninterrupted service .
military interests could dictate that the services be degraded or taken offline altogether to prevent the enemy using the system .
how much will galileo cost ?
galileo will cost 3.2bn euros -lrb- £ 1.9bn -rrb- .
about a third of this will be spent on development .
when will the satellites be launched ?
most of the satellites will be launched in 2006 and 2007 .
they will orbit about 23,000 kilometres above the earth , where their positions will be monitored by a series of ground stations .
service centres will pass on information to users , including transport authorities , companies and people with mobile phones containing special receivers .
does europe need galileo ?
this is a matter of much debate .
there are various considerations including the cost to the taxpayer , job creation in the european hi-tech sector and security issues .
arguments for galileo include : europe needs its own system if new services relying on satellite positioning are to be developed - these would include safety-critical applications where lives would be put at risk if the service could not be guaranteed galileo will achieve better coverage over northern europe galileo will be under civilian control - military interests would not take precedence it will create more than 100,000 jobs .
arguments against the project include : high cost to the taxpayer duplication of existing systems concern , particularly in the united states , that galileo could pose a security threat few benefits to the consumer .

i think the natural cycle is getting strange ; but anyway by looking at those flowers i feel calmer cherry blossom viewer office workers have been heading to prime viewing spots for the traditional drinking session .
the big difference this year is that the blooms are out two weeks earlier than usual .
parties such as these are not normally in full swing until april .
flocking to see " i thought that the blooming would not happen for another few weeks , but since i heard the news that the blossoms were appearing much earlier than usual i hurried to come here , " said one woman .
japanese rush to catch the blossoms before they fade " i think this early blooming is to do with global warming .
i think the natural cycle is getting strange ; but anyway by looking at those flowers i feel calmer , " a man told me .
each year weather forecasters plot the cherry blossom front as it sweeps from the sub-tropical south to the frozen north .
but this time everyone was caught by surprise - the legendary inflexibility of japanese business put to the test as office parties are hastily rearranged .
it has been a dismal winter of recession in japan , if an exceptionally mild one .
with the arrival of spring there are signs that the worst is over , although the recovery could prove to be just as fleeting as the blossom itself .

he is more worried , however .
" there is a kind of bubble economy , i think .

people are n't too worried about the cost of the clothes .

the economy should get a further boost from the world cup and her view is backed up by statistics just released by the bank of korea , showing 3.7 % gdp growth in the final quarter of last year .
the figures indicate that strong domestic consumption was the engine driving the economy .
easy money " traditionally , korean people had been known for their frugality , but nowadays , investment opportunities are saturated ; while availability of credit cards , consumer credit , is quite liberal now , also very low interest rate , " explains koo sung-yeal , an economics professor at yonsei university .
" it seems that korean people are enjoying their consumption opportunities .
this is somewhat different from japanese people .
" for japanese people , they save ... in spite of almost negative interest rate , but korean people , if there 's not much merit in saving , then they purchase , " he adds .
it looks as though consumer spending has been the saviour of the south korean economy as exports continue to fall .
while there are longer-term worries about the economy over-heating , and large unpaid credit debts ; for the moment , south koreans are still happy to shop .

it will be the first time an animated feature will win a competitive oscar and many in the industry think the award is well overdue .
disney know they are in a fight mike young in recent years some of the biggest hits at the box office have been animated movies .
a whole generation of film-goers have fallen in love with shrek , buzz lightyear and sully , animated characters who deserve a place on the a-list of celebrities .
' writing quality ' " shrek as a script stands up to anything , " says mike young , who runs one of the largest independent animation studios in los angeles , producing tv programmes such as butt ugly martians .
" you can say shrek in the same breath as bridget jones 's diary .
jimmy neutron : based on a tv series " it has the same writing quality and therefore attracted an older , adult market . "
despite the evident quality of the film , it has still been a struggle to persuade the academy to recognise the genre .
" the american academy is made up of fairly elderly people and therefore animation is so low on their radar screens they do n't notice it , " says mr young .
' merit ' but ron diamond , co-founder of the animation world network website , says the answer is simpler .
" it has nothing to do with merit or quality of the film .
shrek : will he be grinning on sunday ?
" there have never been enough animated features released in north america to justify a category of its own . "
mr young says a whole chain of films from toy story , to its sequel , to shrek , monsters inc and ice age have helped raise the profile of animation and considerably widened the appeal of such films .
" the real breakthrough was getting adults to see shrek , " says mr young .
mr diamond says : " people of my parents ' generation have a whole different view of animation - they were not perceived as being for adults .
difficult issues " one of the new territories to be explored is more adult-themed animation . "
animated features that deal with difficult issues , adult issues , and with adult relations could become a reality , he adds .
mr diamond says there has been a renaissance in animation in the last 15 years .
" there are a far greater number of films being made than ever before and the academy decided that if there were eight films that qualified for the oscars then the category would be run , " he says .
ice age has recently broken the box office record for a march opening , proving big hit animation films are no passing fad .
given the success of recent animated movies , both men agree there will be a further explosion in such films .
" disney used to make one show every year , but now there is fox , dreamworks , universal , paramount , nickleoden and of course us , the independent sector , " says mr young .
" now disney know they are in a fight , " he adds .
of the three films nominated both men agree they feature strong characters , a good story and accomplished animation .

while mr young says he felt shrek would win mr diamond says he is torn between shrek and monsters , inc .

bbc news -pipe- from our own correspondent -pipe- message in a bottle categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : from our own correspondent front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 23 march , 2002 , 12:37 gmt message in a bottle a perfect beach on the turks and caicos by jackie mulligan my second day on grand turk , a seven by one mile island on the edge of the atlantic made me feel like robinson crusoe .
as i strolled along a deserted beach , i saw a bottle dusted with sand .
as i wiped the beach debris away - i saw a message curled inside a bright green tequila bottle .
it was an exciting moment .
i have no faith in the post - one letter took over four years to reach the islands .
perhaps my family had written ?
no .
an alternative postal system ?
the message had been dropped in the sea by a bunch of french tourists , enjoying a few too many tequila slammers and putting down their inebriated thoughts before casting them off to the elements .
nono , the name for my new bottle penpal , asked the finder to ring her in france if it was found .
after reading the contents she may feel a little self-conscious if i do .
but messages in bottles are not a new phenomenon here .
tracking tidal movements i visited the turks and caicos national museum and they were delighted with my find which now sits in a collection of nearly 100 bottles found predominantly on the same part of the beach that curves round the eastern tip of the island .
the museum is about to stage an exhibition and more ambitiously set to identify tidal movements in the atlantic .
not by science or satellite systems , but by throwing hundreds of bottles back into the sea !
the kitchen is becoming more like a bottle bank every day nigel sadler , museum director it is strange that litter , in the form of bottles discarded on a beach are now about to form an environmental initiative .
it is something that could only happen here .
the museum director , nigel sadler is busy preparing and , until the rest of the population are sparked into action , has become a one-man recycling band .
yet another eccentric brit abroad , he collects clear glass bottles from local beaches and tells me his kitchen is becoming more like a bottle bank every day .
news from afar the earliest message found in grand turk dates back to 1860 when ships used the method to keep the british navy informed of their progress .
not the most reliable way to get help when your ship is sinking .
in 1894 a dedicated brother wrote to his sister to tell her he and his friend were all well and just north of cape verde , west africa .
in 1895 , a belonger -lrb- the name for locals who live here -rrb- , found the letter and posted it on .
miss rogers from scotland was delighted to hear the news that her brother was safe , though not entirely surprised as her brother was sitting by her side at the time .
messages are not always easy to read in spite of the fact that messages in bottles are not the most reliable mechanism to inform anyone of anything , this project will see them used to promote the islands and encourage tourism .
one of the project 's aims is to promote the whereabouts of the islands .
frustrated at puzzled looks at the mention of turks and caicos , residents are being invited to include maps and information about the islands .
the tourist board is behind the initiative as it thinks it could well encourage tourism .
john skippings , tourism director and a man with a strong belief in safeguarding the marketing budget , believes this eccentric " uk 'er " stuff , as he says , could be the cheapest marketing campaign on record and has publicly urged people to get involved .
a homesick sailor walter and cecile , a mature american couple who run a small hotel claim some of the credit for the idea .
they found a bottle from a spanish sailor , who was bored by his task of counting sardines and homesick .
from that small beginning emerged something much more ambitious than a mere exhibition .
garcia , the spanish sailor they sent the sailor information about the turks and caicos islands and in return he sent them information about his hometown in spain .
it was an exchange that involved airmail , email and indeed seamail .
islanders are now receiving instructions on how to write a message in a bottle .
the bottles to be used will all have been collected from local beaches and are , though not in the traditional sense , being recycled .
the hope is that people will reply to the messages and that their replies will make it through the more traditional postal system and as well as gaining pen pals and new visitors , the final whereabouts of the bottles will also help coastal teams track the paths of the bottles to improve their understanding of the atlantic currents .
it 's a unique project on this unique group of 40 islands that make up the turks and caicos .
so next time you walk on a beach , look out for those bottles and please do n't forget to write back soon .

as i strolled along a deserted beach , i saw a bottle dusted with sand .
as i wiped the beach debris away - i saw a message curled inside a bright green tequila bottle .
it was an exciting moment .
i have no faith in the post - one letter took over four years to reach the islands .
perhaps my family had written ?
no .
the message had been dropped in the sea by a bunch of french tourists , enjoying a few too many tequila slammers and putting down their inebriated thoughts before casting them off to the elements .
nono , the name for my new bottle penpal , asked the finder to ring her in france if it was found .
after reading the contents she may feel a little self-conscious if i do .
but messages in bottles are not a new phenomenon here .
tracking tidal movements i visited the turks and caicos national museum and they were delighted with my find which now sits in a collection of nearly 100 bottles found predominantly on the same part of the beach that curves round the eastern tip of the island .
the museum is about to stage an exhibition and more ambitiously set to identify tidal movements in the atlantic .
not by science or satellite systems , but by throwing hundreds of bottles back into the sea ! "
the kitchen is becoming more like a bottle bank every day " nigel sadler , museum director it is strange that litter , in the form of bottles discarded on a beach are now about to form an environmental initiative .
it is something that could only happen here .
the museum director , nigel sadler is busy preparing and , until the rest of the population are sparked into action , has become a one-man recycling band .
yet another eccentric brit abroad , he collects clear glass bottles from local beaches and tells me his kitchen is becoming more like a bottle bank every day .
news from afar the earliest message found in grand turk dates back to 1860 when ships used the method to keep the british navy informed of their progress .
not the most reliable way to get help when your ship is sinking .
in 1894 a dedicated brother wrote to his sister to tell her he and his friend were all well and just north of cape verde , west africa .
in 1895 , a belonger -lrb- the name for locals who live here -rrb- , found the letter and posted it on .
miss rogers from scotland was delighted to hear the news that her brother was safe , though not entirely surprised as her brother was sitting by her side at the time .
in spite of the fact that messages in bottles are not the most reliable mechanism to inform anyone of anything , this project will see them used to promote the islands and encourage tourism .
one of the project 's aims is to promote the whereabouts of the islands .
frustrated at puzzled looks at the mention of turks and caicos , residents are being invited to include maps and information about the islands .
the tourist board is behind the initiative as it thinks it could well encourage tourism .
john skippings , tourism director and a man with a strong belief in safeguarding the marketing budget , believes this eccentric " uk 'er " stuff , as he says , could be the cheapest marketing campaign on record and has publicly urged people to get involved .
a homesick sailor walter and cecile , a mature american couple who run a small hotel claim some of the credit for the idea .
they found a bottle from a spanish sailor , who was bored by his task of counting sardines and homesick .
from that small beginning emerged something much more ambitious than a mere exhibition .
they sent the sailor information about the turks and caicos islands and in return he sent them information about his hometown in spain .
it was an exchange that involved airmail , email and indeed seamail .
islanders are now receiving instructions on how to write a message in a bottle .
the bottles to be used will all have been collected from local beaches and are , though not in the traditional sense , being recycled .
the hope is that people will reply to the messages and that their replies will make it through the more traditional postal system and as well as gaining pen pals and new visitors , the final whereabouts of the bottles will also help coastal teams track the paths of the bottles to improve their understanding of the atlantic currents .
it 's a unique project on this unique group of 40 islands that make up the turks and caicos .
so next time you walk on a beach , look out for those bottles and please do n't forget to write back soon .

the north korean red cross was reported on friday to be ready to meet their japanese counterparts on the issue .
japan believes at least 11 of its nationals were kidnapped by north korean agents in the 1970s and 80s , but pyongyang has repeatedly denied involvement .
some japanese media reported there were suggestions from north korea that one of those abducted was alive - but this has been dismissed as speculation by a tokyo official .
the issue has hampered negotiations between the two countries on establishing formal diplomatic relations .
tokyo watching " we have been demanding north korea take proper measures to deal with the abduction cases .
if this -lsb- announcement -rsb- was made as part of those measures , we would welcome it , " mr koizumi was quoted as saying .
" but we have to watch their actions to determine how serious they are , " he said at the end of a three-day visit to south korea .
on friday he said japan would not give food aid to north korea unless it attempted to resolve the issue .
tokyo believes the japanese were abducted to be trained as spies or to teach japanese language and customs to pyongyang 's operatives .
a number of major japanese newspapers and news agencies said on saturday that diplomats from north korea had " implied " that one abducted national was alive .
some reports named her as keiko arimoto who disappeared in 1983 after studying in britain .
however an unnamed japanese foreign ministry official dismissed the reports as speculative , saying japan had received no such information from north korea , according to the associated press news agency .
the issue of the alleged kidnapping has impeded talks on normalising relations since they began in 1991 .
their last official meeting was late in 2000 - when tokyo demanded a solution to the abduction dispute while pyongyang sought compensation for japan 's colonial rule of korea between 1910 and 1945 .
mr koizumi 's second official visit to south korea since taking office was aimed at improving ties between the two countries - just weeks before they co-host the world cup football finals .
his last trip in october was overshadowed by rows over japan 's handling of its wartime past .

bbc news -pipe- oscars 2002 -pipe- clash of the movie flops categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : in depth : oscars 2002 front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 23 march , 2002 , 12:44 gmt clash of the movie flops tom green : award favourite by bbc news online 's darren waters in los angeles forget the lord of the rings and a beautiful mind the real clash of the titans in hollywood is between freddy got fingered and glitter .
tom green 's comedy and mariah carey 's box office flop are the two leading contenders for the prize of worst film at the razzies on saturday .
and on friday at the stinkers , freddy got fingered was handed five titles , including worst film , worst sense of direction and worst performance by a lead actor for green .
i love the oscars - i just wish they would stop the dance numbers mike lancaster , the stinkers the two " anti-oscar " ceremonies work to " dishonour the worst achievements in film " and provide a healthy antidote to the glamour and excess of the academy awards .
pearl harbor and 3000 miles to graceland also made the worst film shortlist of both events , showing a remarkable degree of consensus .
while town and country was on the stinkers ' shortlist , the razzies opted for sylvester stallone 's driven .
' cringe ' " we do n't take this too seriously and i hope no-one else does , " says mike lancaster , co-founder of the stinkers .
" it is an anti-oscars .
they have best picture , we have worst picture . "
perennial favourite : sylvester stallone he adds : " they do n't take us seriously at all .
but they cringe when they see us and the razzies and see us listed in the newspaper . "
the stinkers celebrates a whole host of mediocrity in cinema - categories include worst sense of direction , worst actor in a leading role , most painfully unfunny comedy , most annoying fake accent and most intrusive musical score .
" i have a great love of film and respect of film .
it is tongue in cheek , it is just a poke and a jab at hollywood because i really love cinema , " says mr lancaster .
' cinematic torture ' " sometimes some of the stuff they put out is not very good .
as well meaning as they are , no-one sets out to make a bad film .
somehow it turns out that way . "
tom green 's freddy got fingered must have gone seriously awry because as well as its five stinkers awards it is up for eight razzies .
mariah carey : her fans could not save glitter " freddy got fingered was probably the definition of cinematic torture .
" i knew it would be bad but i could never have imagined it would have been as gut-wrenchingly awful as it was . "
but mr lancaster says he is not being vindictive - the nominations and winners are chosen by members of the public in a ballot .
mr lancaster says : " it is very subjective - we announced freddy got fingered got nominated and we got emails from people saying ' tom green is the funniest man on the planet ' .
movie ushers " this is n't about making fun of his fans or mariah carey 's fans .
everybody is entitled to their opinion . "
pearl harbor : box office hit the stinkers started in 1979 with two friends who were movie ushers picking their worst films of the year .
mr lancaster says : " it went on year after year , even when we stopped being ushers , adding categories .
then we discovered the internet and it changed everything .
" almost immediately we got media attention and then we went public and allowed people to join our group and vote . "
the size of the failure for mariah carey 's glitter took hollywood by surprise says lancaster .
" if half of the people who bought her records went to see it , it would have opened in the top two .
it shocked hollywood that it did so badly . "
accolade unlike the razzies there is no awards ceremony for the stinkers , although this year , for the first time , there was a prize for the worst film - a small , plastic , flushing toilet .
despite the mocking and the sniggering , mr lancaster says he loves the oscars .
" i just wish they would stop the dance numbers .
" every year they complain the ceremony is too long .
they need to stop the singing and the dancing . "
the 22nd razzie awards take place on saturday , 23 march in santa monica , los angeles .
the oscars ceremony is broadcast live on bbc two on monday 25 march from 0045-0500 gmt and reported live on bbc news online .
