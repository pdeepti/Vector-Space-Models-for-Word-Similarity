ytl offered £ 1.2bn -lrb- $ 1.8bn -rrb- - roughly half cash , half debt - for wessex water , trumping a rival offer from a consortium led by royal bank of scotland and abbey national .
wessex was put up for sale at the end of last year , as part of a wholesale programme of asset sales in the wake of enron 's bankruptcy .
the proceeds will pay off almost all the debts of azurix , the enron subsidiary that controlled wessex water , but will leave almost nothing for enron creditors .
last-minute deal ytl 's successful bid came as a surprise .
the royal bank of scotland team had been given preferential status , but the malaysian firm upped its offer on monday .
according to media reports , some of the bidding banks were concerned about the details of wessex 's finances , and in particular its remaining links with enron .
ytl power is a subsidiary of ytl corp , which has businesses ranging from power generation to cement making and hotels .
this deal represents ytl 's first major step into the european utility market , giving the firm 1.2 million water and 2.5 million sewerage customers , mainly in the south west of england .
business concluded with its debts paid off , azurix will now be wound up .
the firm paid £ 1.4bn for wessex water in 1998 , and its outstanding bonds had a face value of around $ 1.7bn just before enron 's bankruptcy .
the sale has been approved by the boards of azurix and ytl , and is expected to be completed in about two months , pending approval from the us bankruptcy court . watch / listen on this story wessex water chairman colin skellet " it gives an opportunity for employees to become investors " full story in depth latest news andersen guilty auditor verdict impact white house links enron 's survival plan multiplying lawsuits andersen merger fails tales from congress probe hits wall street background fallen media darling scandal at a glance crime and reform rating agencies flack profile : energy giant employees ' tales uk fallout ' cash-for-access ' row who met whom when labour andersen links analysis : labour worry clickable fact files enron : who 's who timeline : the scandal explained talking point your reaction to revelations audio video tv and radio reports see also : 23 mar 02 -pipe- business enron probe focuses on white house internet links : enron wessex water ytl the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : worldcom chiefs refuse to testify buoyant ebay snaps up bills firm digital tv woes hit pace profits bush vows action after scandals merck ' exaggerated ' revenue in accounts congress pushes accounting reform oil trade thaws us-russian ties hiv : the drug firms ' quest for a cure links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

only last week the record company announced that it was to axe 1,800 jobs , or a fifth of its workforce , to cut costs .
but company executives are confident of securing a deal with the pop star , according to the times newspaper .
the sum is twice as much as emi 's original offer , said the paper .
reports of the deal come amid speculation that williams is being chased by american labels .
chart-topping duet the performer 's last album , the frank sinatra-style swing while you 're winning , has already topped five million sales .
and he reached the christmas number one slot last year with a duet with actress nicole kidman .
the singer had signed with emi in march 2001 in what was rumoured to be one of the most expensive recording deals ever .
meanwhile most of emi 's job losses will take effect by the end of the month , the company has already said .
the cuts form part of a wider restructuring exercise aimed at shoring up the heavily-indebted company 's battered finances .
profit warnings the division 's new chairman , alain levy , admitted at the time of last week 's announcement that it was becoming tougher to attract big names like williams .
about a third of the redundancies will be in europe , although it is thought the figure for the uk could be as low as 300 .
the strategy review comes after two profit warnings from emi in the past six months and two failed merger attempts in the past two years .
the company has also blamed the continuing economic downturn in latin america and asia , delays to some album releases in japan and outmoded industry practices for its current difficulties .
but emi has said it is still on track to make a pre-tax profit of £ 150m , in line with its previous forecasts .

they say the action is in retaliation for the controversial arrest of 16 members of their organisation who led an occupation of the president 's family farm at the weekend .
they also say they are planning many more such actions in the coming months .
the front pages of brazil 's main newspapers carried pictures of the 16 lying face down in the dirt outside the president 's family farm with their hands tied behind their backs .
a line of heavily armed police stood over them .
they have been detained and may well be prosecuted for leading a mass takeover of president fernando enrique cardoso 's farm at the weekend , despite promises from the government 's ombudsman on land issues that there would be no arrests if the mst left the farm peacefully .
the ombudsman has since offered his resignation , saying his word was broken .
but the government says he had no jurisdiction to make such promises in the first place .
more takeovers imminent within 24 hours , 150 members of the mst had invaded another farm - this time of a business associate of the president in sao paulo state .
the leader of the occupiers says the action is in retaliation for the 16 arrests .
mst leaders have been saying they plan a wave of land takeovers during the next month .
they say occupying unproductive farms is the only way to push the government to carry out land reform in brazil , where 20 % of the population own 90 % of farmland .
the government says it has already given land to half a million families in the last eight years - a figure disputed by the mst who say far fewer families have benefited .

but two years ago , the outside world hardly saw her at all .
for between six and 20 hours a day , she sat in front of the computer .
" i stopped being an outgoing person , " she says .
" ironically , the friends who i was getting online to try to talk to were often out doing things .
" and i did n't do anything with them , because i was too busy being online , and hogging the phone lines that they were calling me on , to invite me places . "
her story is a familiar one to dr hilarie cash and jay parker , who together have set up a counselling centre called internet / computer addiction services near seattle , in the pacific northwest of the us .
online for 36 hours jessica 's problem appears mild compared with the extreme examples that have confronted jay parker .
click here to tell us if you are spending too much time online he has found that the online multiple user games , where players take on fantasy roles to compete against opponents logged on all over the world , are particularly addictive .
jessica is online for just one hour a day " i came across a young man who was in college .
by the end of october , he stopped going to class .
and by the first week in december , he had a psychotic breakdown after being online for 36 hours in a row , for sleep deprivation .
" if he started drinking alcoholically , it would take him more than that period of time to self-destruct .
this happened so quickly .
" he dropped out of school in his last year , he had a relationship with a girlfriend and that went away , and he ends up in a psyche ward .
it just devastated this guy . "
spotting the symptoms many of us would admit to the occasional bleary-eyed internet-frenzy .
but just how much is too much ?
" it 's rather like , how many beers do you have to drink to be an alcoholic ?
it 's very ambiguous , " says mr parker .
the escape key could prove a way out " that said , there are signs and symptoms .
first of all , can somebody not accurately predict how much time they 're going to spend online , prior to getting online ?
" and then , what pieces of your real life are going away , because of your behaviour ? "
those symptoms are becoming common .
dr cash and mr parker estimate that up to 10 % of all online americans are addicted .
for dr cash , the most worrying aspect of internet addiction is the vulnerability of children .
" children seem to be very easily hooked into certain aspects , such as multi-user games and pornography .
the younger the person , the more vulnerable they are . "
she says schools and parents should wake up to the dangers .
supervision , says dr cash , is absolutely vital : " we advise parents not to let their kids have internet access for hours on end in their rooms alone .
" it 's very , very easy for them to be getting into trouble on the internet , and the parents to be oblivious to it . "
facing up to addiction for those who just can not turn away from the computer screen , mr parker recommends the traditional 12-step model pioneered by alcoholics anonymous .

but two years ago , the outside world hardly saw her at all .
for between six and 20 hours a day , she sat in front of the computer .
" i stopped being an outgoing person , " she says .
" ironically , the friends who i was getting online to try to talk to were often out doing things .
" and i did n't do anything with them , because i was too busy being online , and hogging the phone lines that they were calling me on , to invite me places . "
her story is a familiar one to dr hilarie cash and jay parker , who together have set up a counselling centre called internet / computer addiction services near seattle , in the pacific northwest of the us .
online for 36 hours jessica 's problem appears mild compared with the extreme examples that have confronted jay parker .
click here to tell us if you are spending too much time online he has found that the online multiple user games , where players take on fantasy roles to compete against opponents logged on all over the world , are particularly addictive .
" i came across a young man who was in college .
by the end of october , he stopped going to class .
and by the first week in december , he had a psychotic breakdown after being online for 36 hours in a row , for sleep deprivation .
" if he started drinking alcoholically , it would take him more than that period of time to self-destruct .
this happened so quickly .
" he dropped out of school in his last year , he had a relationship with a girlfriend and that went away , and he ends up in a psyche ward .
it just devastated this guy . "
spotting the symptoms many of us would admit to the occasional bleary-eyed internet-frenzy .
but just how much is too much ?
" it 's rather like , how many beers do you have to drink to be an alcoholic ?
it 's very ambiguous , " says mr parker .
" that said , there are signs and symptoms .
first of all , can somebody not accurately predict how much time they 're going to spend online , prior to getting online ?
" and then , what pieces of your real life are going away , because of your behaviour ? "
those symptoms are becoming common .
dr cash and mr parker estimate that up to 10 % of all online americans are addicted .
for dr cash , the most worrying aspect of internet addiction is the vulnerability of children .
" children seem to be very easily hooked into certain aspects , such as multi-user games and pornography .
the younger the person , the more vulnerable they are . "
she says schools and parents should wake up to the dangers .
supervision , says dr cash , is absolutely vital : " we advise parents not to let their kids have internet access for hours on end in their rooms alone .
" it 's very , very easy for them to be getting into trouble on the internet , and the parents to be oblivious to it . "
facing up to addiction for those who just can not turn away from the computer screen , mr parker recommends the traditional 12-step model pioneered by alcoholics anonymous .
the patient must acknowledge the addiction , and admit they can not manage it on their own .
then they are linked to a support network , so that when they feel the urge to power up the computer , they can contact someone and talk it through . "
i see people for real , instead of just seeing their little names show up on the computer screen " jessica nicholas dr cash says her approach is more " cognitive behavioural " , in other words , helping people understand their thought patterns , and how to change them .
" the way you think is very strongly tied to the way you feel .

" and if you say that enough times to yourself , it becomes a habit of thought . "
both counsellors stress that they 're not recommending that anyone retire the computer and resort to pen and paper .
" the computer 's here to stay , it 's part of our life and definitely part of our future .
it 's really about creating healthy boundaries , a healthy balance , " says mr parker .
an hour a day jessica nicholas tried the approach , with the help of dr cash and her parents , and it did help .

the home secretary is calling for hundreds of prisoners to be released early and fitted with electronic tags .
in a speech to prison and probation inspectors , mr blunkett will say early release should be the automatic first option for offenders serving short sentences , except for those convicted of sexual or violent crime .
the prison population is at a record level of more than 70,000 , but the home office insists the impetus for early release is to cut re-offending - not to ease over-crowding .
but the conservatives say the move makes a mockery of the criminal justice system .
they say the government must ensure criminals serve their sentences , even if that means building more jails .
what do you think ?
will electronic tagging of offenders work ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction prisoners should be released from prison every day .
in work parties , in order to go out and spend their time gainfully renovating disused properties and the like which could then be given over to the local councils to be used to help overcome the housing shortage .
everyone wins .
the prisoners learn trades which will prevent them slipping back into crime when they are finally released , they also undergo a form of punishment , and the taxpayer has something more tangible to behold for his outlay than a supercharged hoodlum .
also , the cost of carpenters and plumbers might become more realistic !
shaun , teignmouth uk i am disappointed at the " hang ' em & flog ' em " attitude of most of the contributors john , uk i am disappointed at the " hang ' em & flog ' em " attitude of most of the contributors .
the decision to release a prisoner early with a tag would only be done after deciding if the person was liable to re-offend , the nature of their crime and many other factors .
not all prisoners are there because they mugged a little old lady .
john , uk the law-abiding public need protection , and whilst i am for more rehabilitation work whilst offenders are in prison , i do n't feel they should be released early .
we already have a system which criminals do not fear , with courts failing to jail offenders who then continue to make the general public suffer .
if we have to build more prisons , then we must do so .
frankly we are never going to solve these problems , until we have a government who does more for the poorer elements in our society , and narrows the gap between rich and poor .
margaret thatcher would be proud of tony blair 's efforts to date !
mike , uk short sentences do not deter .
that 's why the prisons are full .
sam , uk i think that it might be worth a try , but we should be very , very careful which criminals get to walk this road angie , bar harbor , maine , usa i think that it might be worth a try , but we should be very , very careful which criminals get to walk this road .
non-payment of fines does sound like a contender .
if there is a victim involved , perhaps they could be given a power of veto , and , if tagged and released , why not keep the tag on for twice the remaining time of sentence as a condition of release .
violent sorts ?
keep ' em in .
angie , bar harbor , maine , usa the national probation service is rarely mentioned in any discussion about the release of prisoners unless something goes wrong .
the fact of the matter is that they work long and hard protecting the public and getting it right when assessing some of the most dangerous people eligible to be released .
a clear distinction has to be made in the public mind between the dangerous high risk offenders who will stay in prison and the proposed release of a number of lower risk prisoners who are very often sentenced to custody for non-violent offences such as relatively minor dishonesty offences , driving whilst disqualified , and non-payment of fines .
it is highly unlikely that such people once tagged will pose an increased risk to the public .
what needs to be addressed are the anomalies in the criminal justice system that allows sentencers to send large numbers of people into custody who could well be made subject to community orders and thereby supervised intensively .
custody should be a last resort not a first .
david raho , uk what 's the point with fitting them with an electronic tag ?
is it an easter present john , uk what 's the point with fitting them with an electronic tag ?
is it an easter present .
why ca n't they get on with the job and build more multi-storey high security prisons instead of spending public money on building things like the millennium dome .
and even if we tag them and find out that they have committed a crime where are we supposed to put them ?
and we usually tag animals , it goes against human rights to tag human beings .
i think we are basically letting criminals go free .
what if they manage to fly outside britain .
are we going to trace each and every of them ?
john , uk i do n't think it 's too bad an idea , if criminals who have committed non-violent crimes were given this tagging scheme , then i do n't think i would mind .
however if violent criminals / sex offenders were given this tagging scheme then i would be 100 % against it .
russell , uk all those who advocate early release of any criminal clearly are fortunate enough to live in areas which do not suffer at the hands of these parasites .
i note that the people marked for release are those guilty of such offences as burglary , theft and drug offences .
in other words , crimes which most often occur in deprived areas , well away from the odious bunch of champagne socialists who constantly harp on about their welfare .
it 's an affront to the victims of these scum , as well as the people who have to put up with their anti-social behaviour on a daily basis .
people like blunkett and blair living in their sheltered and affluent areas would never understand .
another preposterous move from an out of touch and bumbling government .
dan , uk if there was a proper deterrent for crime in this country we would not have to resort to these frankly ridiculous measures to alleviate the overcrowding problems , as there would be less crime in the first instance .
steve west , uk given that a recently estimated 80 % of all crimes currently remain unsolved , the true figure for re-offending by tagged criminals must be closer to 10 % cb , england may i point out that the government 's claim that only 2 % of electronically tagged criminals re-offend is incorrect ?
the fact is , only 2 % of tagged criminals are brought to trial for re-offending - which is an altogether different matter .
given that a recently estimated 80 % of all crimes currently remain unsolved , the true figure for re-offending by tagged criminals - as opposed to actual convictions for re-offending - must be closer to 10 % .
so , if we have 70,000 electronically tagged criminals re-offending in-line with the statistical average , they may be expected to collectively commit 7,000 new offences of which 5,600 will remain unsolved .
with the foregoing in mind , the fact that david blunkett can maintain that releasing prisoners and tagging them is a good idea simply beggars belief .
cb , england of course offenders should be released early and the worse the offence , the sooner .
it 's the best way i know of to keep the police and the judges fully employed and off the public dole .
mark , usa you have a carrot and a stick .
no early release takes away the prison officer 's carrot .
his job is now much harder .
electronic tagging : people who are not violent do not belong in jail .
tag them make them come home at 19:30 and feed and look after themselves .
if they do not get the message them maybe jail .
steve kniste , uk tagging should only apply to those people who are unlikely to reoffend .
anybody who has committed a violent crime or is in prison for a second or more time should not be eligible .
prison server is to punish and rehabilitate .
only when prisoners have been adequately punished should they be eligible .
tagging should also be used for every prisoner on parole and restrictions should be put on them .
it should still be seen as a punishment and not a desirable easy option .
jb , uk this is yet another spur of the moment policy , from a government that appears unable to approach any subject with any semblance of coherence .
phil , uk offenders should serve the sentence that they have been given in full .
as has already been pointed out , too much concern is wasted on these criminals .
do-gooders should mind their own and show their concern for the victims of crimes , the children who are abused , the women who are raped , the elderly who are mugged and beaten .
i know the prison service is overcrowded , that is something the government should address - create facilities for more prisoners .
if i had to pay an increase in tax to know that my wife , young son and family were even a little safer i would pay without hesitation .
sm , uk why no let out the people in prison for non-payment of fines and such like ?
chris , uk we are about to have a crackdown on crime .
this means that muggers and the like are going to need prison space .
so why no let out the people in prison for non-payment of fines and such like , albeit with limited freedoms ?
we need to free up some prison space - it 's not brain surgery !
chris , uk there 's a more important point being missed here ; why are so many people concerned about prisons becoming crowded and under-facilitated ?
i 'd much rather know that the parasites are crammed into bunk-beds , 4 to a cell and eating meals of the most basic standard than what we have currently ...
colour tv , their own cells in many cases , access to pool tables and various other recreational facilities - things i have to do a hard , honest week 's work to enjoy .
maybe i chose the wrong path ?
wayne brannan , uk why so many offenders in the first place , especially children ?
i have to agree with simon , uk , that it is directly linked to discipline .
we need to get back to a system of teaching children that there are consequences for their actions .
releasing offenders early is giving the wrong lesson .
why work hard to earn a living when you can just steal from others and get tagged for a few months .
a strong message needs to be sent out that crime does not pay and will be punished .
i believe this will cut down the crime rate and therefore there wo n't be a need for more prisons .
why is society so scared of getting tough ?
charmaine , uk when will people start to draw a number of subjects together ; the abolition of discipline in schools and the increasing number of parents who have children without understanding their responsibilities means that we have a gradual increase of people in society who ca n't differentiate right from wrong .
inevitably , this leads to an increase in street crime etc as we are currently witnessing .
ally this to the obsession with finding excuses for perpetrators of crime and disregarding the victims , plus a legal system that has lost sight of justice and is now more concerned with making money from arguing points of law and you have the sorry state in which we find ourselves .
why wo n't it get resolved - measures implemented now would not yield real benefits until tony blair is a distant memory and , secondly , since the majority of our politicians are from have a background in law , their is no real political will .
early release is a case of addressing a symptom rather than the cause .
simon , uk electronic tagging will have no appreciable benefit once the tags have been removed tony , england electronic tagging will have no appreciable benefit once the tags have been removed .
if you want to use the system then have a period of tagging at the end of the full sentence .
after all when they are locked up the rest of us are safe from them .
we need more prisons , for even if we release all those who really should n't be in prison , there are more than that number terrorising society , who the police and courts have so far failed to incarcerate .
in reality nothing will change in the near future , for this government which had every opportunity when the tories were destroyed by the electorate , have failed abysmally to demonstrate any form of leadership .
tony , england this government 's solution to any crime problem seems to be to not make it a crime .
they 're trying it with cannabis they 're now trying it with convicted criminals .
if we have a crime problem , and there are n't enough prison places then build more prisons , provide more police on the beat .
what next ?
we ca n't catch all rapists so stop rape being a crime ?
john , uk if i get caught driving 35 in a 30mph zone , the very full weight of the legal system is brought down on me .
if i mug some old granny i just get a " good talking to " neil pearce , london , england we need lots more prisons , but built to a much more basic standard .
no more television sets in rooms , computers , education classes and fancy food .
simple bare walls , hard floors and bread and water .
neil pearce , london , england e have hard currency , the russians have unused prison camps in siberia , and i 'm sure they would be delighted to take the drug pushers , muggers , rapists and paedophiles off our hands guy hammond , england the solution to overcrowded prisons is obvious .
we have hard currency , the russians have unused prison camps in siberia , and i 'm sure they would be delighted to take the drug pushers , muggers , rapists and paedophiles off our hands at a much lower cost than running prisons or tagging schemes in the uk .
guy hammond , england to chris b - you ca n't label these people as prisoners !
they are criminals .
imprisonment is an ancient and out dated form of punishment .
it is costly to the innocent as we pay through our taxes .
if we build more prisons we will have less money to spend on other things like health care or schools .
we need a modern form of punishment , one that shows how we have advanced as a society , not how we are all to eager to push away and hide the product of human greed .
let 's get these people out and educate them , show them that they are a part of humanity and they can make a positive contribution .
chris warwick , uk i fail to comprehend how releasing prisoners into a society in which most crimes remain unsolved , and in which the crime rate is - not surprisingly - soaring , is going to reduce crime .
this week 's favourite phrase : " cut re-offending " , is a poor whitewash of an excuse made by an incompetent home secretary who has no concept of cause and effect , and who is consequently at a complete loss for a sensible strategy .
the bottom line is the need to cut crime - and we will never achieve that by emptying criminals out of the prisons and back onto the streets .
all that achieves is the provision of more fodder for the police , the courts , and society in general to have to cope with .
chris b , england the majority of the subscribers to this debate have focussed upon the criminals and not the victims .
releasing these parasites to prey upon other innocent victims is a typical left wing bleeding heart liberal attitude and effectively tells the community that the criminals ' welfare comes before their victims ' welfare .
ralph e snape , england if someone is out , and tag and they kill someone , that is in my eye murder by the state or are failing us miserably , be it health , law and order , justice , europe , public transport the list is endless .

ner do wells , opportunists and socially inadequate individuals , psychiatric cases make up the bulk of the prison population .
they are in prison because " society " is unable or , unwilling , to provide sheltered working environments for them .
either way , you pay via prisons or , social services .
take your pick .
i would prefer the social services route .
mart , canada it seems to me that we send too many offenders to prison , for too many reasons which have more to do with fear than rehabilitation .
policies such as zero tolerance and the war on drugs are merely fascism under a different name , placebos for middle-class anxieties , meaningless political rhetoric .
excuses for and amelioration of a media produced anxiety .
all criminalization does is produce another unemployable underclass .
make the choice either return to the 17th century and hang every offender or look for an alternative way of accepting crime socially , realistically , but do not make the mistake of imprisoning too many because that remedy has been discredited since the early 18th century .
it merely hardens offenders george stainer , uk corporate-run prisons are the fastest growing industry in the usa , which , ironically , has the most prisoners per-capita than any other country .
does this practice benefit anyone but the stockholders in these corporations ?
do these corporations have lobbyists who influence government toward greater and greater levels of incarceration for non-violent crime ?
i am not familiar with the severity of crime in britain but i do know that in my country the policy of " lock ' em up and throw away the key " only ruins families and prevents a lot of nice people who screwed up from being assets to society .
i strongly support the use of electronic monitoring instead of prison because it enables a human being to live their life while preventing further offences .
it is a well known fact in this country that a jail-sentence often ruins many more lives than the petty , victimless , crime that put them there .
anthony stephenson , usa simple - harsher punisment equals less crime equals less jails and the need to tag .
the uk has got into this situation by being too soft and tagging is another form of being too soft .
the crime rate on the isle of man is minimal as the law is very hard and people realise if your not prepared to do the time - do n't do the crime .
get tough , get real and up the punishment - slapping a pretty wrist tag on somebody and telling them to stay in is not a punishment - its a big cop out !
david lj , isle of man uk if you have too little prison space , build another prison stephen , usa one talking point asks " will street crime crackdown work ? " and another asks " should offenders be released early ? "
i see a crackdown and an early release working as opposite effects of each other .
a revolving door , a criminal gets arrested , spends a tiny bit of time in jail only to be released with a little bracelet on their wrist ?
hardly a " crackdown " eh ?
more like a silly joke .
this is n't rocket science ; if you have too little prison space , build another prison .
stephen , usa how can this government ever expect any proposal to work when ministers are more concerned with banning hunting with dogs than with getting the country 's health , education and justice systems working effectively ?
roisin lamprell , england , uk i think it 's an idea but not a long-term solution .
i do n't know what i have against it but it just does n't seem like a good idea to me .
they 've committed a crime ; i think they should serve their punishment .
jen , uk prison overcrowding can only be resolved by building more prisons kevin j , uk all this is about is to cut costs and save the government money .
prison overcrowding can only be resolved by building more prisons .
electronic tagging may well stop re-offending while the tag is on , take it off and they 'll just re-offend .
so what 's he going on about !
more prisons need to be built , the whole justice system needs to be evaluated and offenders need educating and taught skills so they 're given a chance for when they 're released back into society .
i do n't think electronic tagging is the answer at all .
kevin j , uk once again the uk government is trying the cheap solution .
why do n't they just increase capacity of the prison system by using certain inmates for more public service and tagging them ?
and then tagging prisoners who are released after their full term for a certain probation period .
michael , dublin , ireland we could take things a step further , instead of letting them out early , why put them in at all .
by the government 's stats if letting them out early reduces the risk of them committing more crime , then surely not putting them in prison would eradicate it altogether .
paul , england it 's just a slap in the face for their victims baz , england there should be no early release for prisoners whatever they were jailed for ; it 's just a slap in the face for their victims .
with the increase in crime we should be taking more positive action , such as building more prisons , recruiting more prison officers and giving longer sentences .
we should be keeping these people of our streets , not sending them home .
baz , england letting out criminals early , playing with statistics and talking tough ...
surely the criminals are quaking in their boots !
i say build extra jails and do not worry about the amount of colour television they will need in their cells .
mike , uk if prisoners are released tagged , who checks the tags as to where they are ?
is it another job for the hard-pressed police forces ?
j. coales , uk in the very same day the government release figures that street crimes , muggings etc , have risen by 25 % we are now contemplating releasing criminals early from prison ? what is the world coming to ? .
i only hope the police are about to announce a huge recruitment campaign as things can only get worse !
james , uk releasing them a little earlier under controlled conditions , would increase the positive impact criminal punishment brings to the offenders loz , uk a vast majority of offenders are released before their sentences are complete .
releasing them a little earlier under controlled conditions , would increase the positive impact criminal punishment brings to the offenders .
it would be better for society than the thought of a criminal being released to do as they please , with out superfluous attention of the authorities .
loz , uk anyone who ends up in prison has obviously caused discomfort to another person or persons .
why should we just let them out because they have n't got their own cells ?
mark j , herts , uk mr blunkett has to let convicts out of prison to make room for the success of his crackdown on street crime .
unfortunately the statistics he released demonstrating the " success " of tagging did n't really show the whole picture .
yes only 10 % of those tagged and released early re-offended and were convicted .
however , around 50 % were arrested for various crimes but not convicted .
geoff harding , england i think the government are simply trying to cut costs and make room in the prisons emily woodrow , england once a criminal has made the choice to commit a crime it is only right they should be given a punishment .
i think the government are simply trying to cut costs and make room in the prisons .
emily woodrow , england it seems to me that releasing people from prison because of overcrowding is missing the point .
presumably they were sent there because we considered that they deserved it .
how does a problem with the prison population change this ?
all we 're doing is answering the wrong question .
if our judgement says that a custodial sentence is justified and the prisons are full to the brim , then we 'll just have to build more prisons .
perhaps we can reflect on the extent of the malaise in our society whilst we 're laying the bricks paul b , oxfordshire , uk what is the point of prison sentences of weeks in duration ?
prison should be reserved for people who need to be in one for an appreciable period of time on grounds of public safety .
if someone is being sentenced to a couple of weeks or months should n't we find some other way of dealing with them ?
is there any point in people losing jobs and homes for the sake of such insignificant jail terms ?
better to have them making some real restitution for what they have done - something which is already shown to slash recidivism rates .
to the people who say , " build more prisons " i say " let us know where you live so the new ones can be put next door to you " !
andy richards , uk offenders should not be allowed to have any of their liberties back dave , uk although i usually have a liberal opinion on this matter i believe that offenders should not be allowed to have any of their liberties back , via this tagging program .
if the crime warrants incarceration , then so be it .
i think we should let the present overcrowding of prisons continue .
only then will the real problems of society and crime be addressed .
will the public be content having twice the amount of offences committed in five years time , -lrb- if crime continues on its latest trend -rrb- just so long as they can say that our prisons are no longer over-crowded ?
to me this would be unacceptable .
dave , uk the overall crime figures show that this government is coping rather well with law and order , so i think this initiative at least deserves a chance .
in my opinion , cutting crime should take priority over the desire to punish wrongdoers , and that seems to be the essence of the argument here .
jon , basingstoke , uk i think mr blunkett should be re-designated the title minister for knee-jerk reactions .
mark humphries , england what about investing some money into more prisons then ?
get tougher and help discourage the repeat offences .
also hit young offenders harder while they are impressionable , tackle the disease , not the symptoms !
tony kenny , uk it depends whether we , as a society , want to punish convicted criminals , or reduce re-offending .
the two aims often conflict with each other .
speaking as someone who has been burgled in the past , i 'm content to see imaginative policies like this used , but only if they can be proven to have a positive effect on levels of crime .
john , england apart from a very small minority , all offenders in our prisons today will be released sooner or later anyway mark griffiths , england i say well done david blunkett !
the experience of the last three years of home detention curfew shows that tagging offenders works .
over 90 % complete their sentences successfully which means that contrary to popular newspaper stories , there have been many more success stories than failures .
and let 's face it , apart from a very small minority , all offenders in our prisons today will be released sooner or later anyway .
so let 's ease them back into the community in a controlled way rather than simply throwing them out at the end of their sentence without any support .
should we build more jails ?
this is not the answer .
we already lock up more people per head than any other european country apart from portugal and in order to accommodate a 30 % rise in the prison population it would cost over £ 500m to administer and £ 1bn in building new institutions .
mark griffiths , england talk tough , act weak .
that appears to be the government 's policy on crime .
put a spin on " getting tough " while letting criminals out of jail early .
unfortunately no amount of spin and propaganda will convince the victims or friends and family of victims who are also voters and taxpayers .
alex keenleyside , england am i the only one who can see the irony here ?
james crosby , telford , england on wednesday we were being told that criminals were going to be targeted in a crackdown on crime .
the next day we 're told that the best way to stop them from re-offending is to release them before their sentences are completed .
am i the only one who can see the irony here ?
james crosby , telford , england we are already too lenient on criminals , so why are we now letting them out early ?
james edwards , england we had that in the united states for decades .
we 've released these kinds of people for one reason or another early and many of them went out to commit more crimes .
some of our state legislatures have reacted against this practice by enacting minimum sentences that neither judges nor parole boards can overrule .
learn from our past mistakes .
mark , usa to : geir in norway , comparisons between europe and usa or usa with canada are not valid because europe dumped its criminals on the us and it is still occurring that the us receives a high percentage of outright criminals from other countries .
visit baltimore or d.c. and take a stroll on a summer night .
john w. shirley , usa to mark in the usa : ask yourself why the crime rate in canada is so much lower than in the us , and perhaps you may have to revise some of your opinions about criminal behaviour .
it is no longer politically correct to speak about the social causes of crime in the uk , and it never has been in the us .
but if people in these two countries were not so self-obsessed , and were willing to find out why other countries have lower crime rates , then perhaps they might have been able to tackle rising crime rates in a manner that is worthy of democratic states , and not speak of police state-syle zero tolerance .

the home secretary is calling for hundreds of prisoners to be released early and fitted with electronic tags .
in a speech to prison and probation inspectors , mr blunkett will say early release should be the automatic first option for offenders serving short sentences , except for those convicted of sexual or violent crime .
the prison population is at a record level of more than 70,000 , but the home office insists the impetus for early release is to cut re-offending - not to ease over-crowding .
but the conservatives say the move makes a mockery of the criminal justice system .
they say the government must ensure criminals serve their sentences , even if that means building more jails .
what do you think ?
will electronic tagging of offenders work ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction prisoners should be released from prison every day .
in work parties , in order to go out and spend their time gainfully renovating disused properties and the like which could then be given over to the local councils to be used to help overcome the housing shortage .
everyone wins .
the prisoners learn trades which will prevent them slipping back into crime when they are finally released , they also undergo a form of punishment , and the taxpayer has something more tangible to behold for his outlay than a supercharged hoodlum .
also , the cost of carpenters and plumbers might become more realistic !
shaun , teignmouth uk " i am disappointed at the " hang ' em & flog ' em " attitude of most of the contributors " john , uk i am disappointed at the " hang ' em & flog ' em " attitude of most of the contributors .
the decision to release a prisoner early with a tag would only be done after deciding if the person was liable to re-offend , the nature of their crime and many other factors .
not all prisoners are there because they mugged a little old lady .
john , uk the law-abiding public need protection , and whilst i am for more rehabilitation work whilst offenders are in prison , i do n't feel they should be released early .
we already have a system which criminals do not fear , with courts failing to jail offenders who then continue to make the general public suffer .
if we have to build more prisons , then we must do so .
frankly we are never going to solve these problems , until we have a government who does more for the poorer elements in our society , and narrows the gap between rich and poor .
margaret thatcher would be proud of tony blair 's efforts to date !
mike , uk short sentences do not deter .
that 's why the prisons are full .
sam , uk " i think that it might be worth a try , but we should be very , very careful which criminals get to walk this road " angie , bar harbor , maine , usa i think that it might be worth a try , but we should be very , very careful which criminals get to walk this road .
non-payment of fines does sound like a contender .
if there is a victim involved , perhaps they could be given a power of veto , and , if tagged and released , why not keep the tag on for twice the remaining time of sentence as a condition of release .
violent sorts ?
keep ' em in .
angie , bar harbor , maine , usa the national probation service is rarely mentioned in any discussion about the release of prisoners unless something goes wrong .
the fact of the matter is that they work long and hard protecting the public and getting it right when assessing some of the most dangerous people eligible to be released .
a clear distinction has to be made in the public mind between the dangerous high risk offenders who will stay in prison and the proposed release of a number of lower risk prisoners who are very often sentenced to custody for non-violent offences such as relatively minor dishonesty offences , driving whilst disqualified , and non-payment of fines .
it is highly unlikely that such people once tagged will pose an increased risk to the public .
what needs to be addressed are the anomalies in the criminal justice system that allows sentencers to send large numbers of people into custody who could well be made subject to community orders and thereby supervised intensively .
custody should be a last resort not a first .
david raho , uk " what 's the point with fitting them with an electronic tag ?
is it an easter present " john , uk what 's the point with fitting them with an electronic tag ?
is it an easter present .
why ca n't they get on with the job and build more multi-storey high security prisons instead of spending public money on building things like the millennium dome .
and even if we tag them and find out that they have committed a crime where are we supposed to put them ?
and we usually tag animals , it goes against human rights to tag human beings .
i think we are basically letting criminals go free .
what if they manage to fly outside britain .
are we going to trace each and every of them ?
john , uk i do n't think it 's too bad an idea , if criminals who have committed non-violent crimes were given this tagging scheme , then i do n't think i would mind .
however if violent criminals / sex offenders were given this tagging scheme then i would be 100 % against it .
russell , uk all those who advocate early release of any criminal clearly are fortunate enough to live in areas which do not suffer at the hands of these parasites .
i note that the people marked for release are those guilty of such offences as burglary , theft and drug offences .
in other words , crimes which most often occur in deprived areas , well away from the odious bunch of champagne socialists who constantly harp on about their welfare .
it 's an affront to the victims of these scum , as well as the people who have to put up with their anti-social behaviour on a daily basis .
people like blunkett and blair living in their sheltered and affluent areas would never understand .
another preposterous move from an out of touch and bumbling government .
dan , uk if there was a proper deterrent for crime in this country we would not have to resort to these frankly ridiculous measures to alleviate the overcrowding problems , as there would be less crime in the first instance .
steve west , uk " given that a recently estimated 80 % of all crimes currently remain unsolved , the true figure for re-offending by tagged criminals must be closer to 10 % " cb , england may i point out that the government 's claim that only 2 % of electronically tagged criminals re-offend is incorrect ?
the fact is , only 2 % of tagged criminals are brought to trial for re-offending - which is an altogether different matter .
given that a recently estimated 80 % of all crimes currently remain unsolved , the true figure for re-offending by tagged criminals - as opposed to actual convictions for re-offending - must be closer to 10 % .
so , if we have 70,000 electronically tagged criminals re-offending in-line with the statistical average , they may be expected to collectively commit 7,000 new offences of which 5,600 will remain unsolved .
with the foregoing in mind , the fact that david blunkett can maintain that releasing prisoners and tagging them is a good idea simply beggars belief .
cb , england of course offenders should be released early and the worse the offence , the sooner .
it 's the best way i know of to keep the police and the judges fully employed and off the public dole .
mark , usa you have a carrot and a stick .
no early release takes away the prison officer 's carrot .
his job is now much harder .
electronic tagging : people who are not violent do not belong in jail .
tag them make them come home at 19:30 and feed and look after themselves .
if they do not get the message them maybe jail .
steve kniste , uk tagging should only apply to those people who are unlikely to reoffend .
anybody who has committed a violent crime or is in prison for a second or more time should not be eligible .
prison server is to punish and rehabilitate .
only when prisoners have been adequately punished should they be eligible .
tagging should also be used for every prisoner on parole and restrictions should be put on them .
it should still be seen as a punishment and not a desirable easy option .
jb , uk this is yet another spur of the moment policy , from a government that appears unable to approach any subject with any semblance of coherence .
phil , uk offenders should serve the sentence that they have been given in full .
as has already been pointed out , too much concern is wasted on these criminals .
do-gooders should mind their own and show their concern for the victims of crimes , the children who are abused , the women who are raped , the elderly who are mugged and beaten .
i know the prison service is overcrowded , that is something the government should address - create facilities for more prisoners .
if i had to pay an increase in tax to know that my wife , young son and family were even a little safer i would pay without hesitation .
sm , uk " why no let out the people in prison for non-payment of fines and such like ? "
chris , uk we are about to have a crackdown on crime .
this means that muggers and the like are going to need prison space .
so why no let out the people in prison for non-payment of fines and such like , albeit with limited freedoms ?
we need to free up some prison space - it 's not brain surgery !
chris , uk there 's a more important point being missed here ; why are so many people concerned about prisons becoming crowded and under-facilitated ?
i 'd much rather know that the parasites are crammed into bunk-beds , 4 to a cell and eating meals of the most basic standard than what we have currently ...
colour tv , their own cells in many cases , access to pool tables and various other recreational facilities - things i have to do a hard , honest week 's work to enjoy .
maybe i chose the wrong path ?
wayne brannan , uk why so many offenders in the first place , especially children ?
i have to agree with simon , uk , that it is directly linked to discipline .
we need to get back to a system of teaching children that there are consequences for their actions .
releasing offenders early is giving the wrong lesson .
why work hard to earn a living when you can just steal from others and get tagged for a few months .
a strong message needs to be sent out that crime does not pay and will be punished .
i believe this will cut down the crime rate and therefore there wo n't be a need for more prisons .
why is society so scared of getting tough ?
charmaine , uk when will people start to draw a number of subjects together ; the abolition of discipline in schools and the increasing number of parents who have children without understanding their responsibilities means that we have a gradual increase of people in society who ca n't differentiate right from wrong .
inevitably , this leads to an increase in street crime etc as we are currently witnessing .
ally this to the obsession with finding excuses for perpetrators of crime and disregarding the victims , plus a legal system that has lost sight of justice and is now more concerned with making money from arguing points of law and you have the sorry state in which we find ourselves .
why wo n't it get resolved - measures implemented now would not yield real benefits until tony blair is a distant memory and , secondly , since the majority of our politicians are from have a background in law , their is no real political will .
early release is a case of addressing a symptom rather than the cause .
simon , uk " electronic tagging will have no appreciable benefit once the tags have been removed " tony , england electronic tagging will have no appreciable benefit once the tags have been removed .
if you want to use the system then have a period of tagging at the end of the full sentence .
after all when they are locked up the rest of us are safe from them .
we need more prisons , for even if we release all those who really should n't be in prison , there are more than that number terrorising society , who the police and courts have so far failed to incarcerate .
in reality nothing will change in the near future , for this government which had every opportunity when the tories were destroyed by the electorate , have failed abysmally to demonstrate any form of leadership .
tony , england this government 's solution to any crime problem seems to be to not make it a crime .
they 're trying it with cannabis they 're now trying it with convicted criminals .
if we have a crime problem , and there are n't enough prison places then build more prisons , provide more police on the beat .
what next ?
we ca n't catch all rapists so stop rape being a crime ?
john , uk if i get caught driving 35 in a 30mph zone , the very full weight of the legal system is brought down on me .
if i mug some old granny i just get a " good talking to " neil pearce , london , england we need lots more prisons , but built to a much more basic standard .
no more television sets in rooms , computers , education classes and fancy food .
simple bare walls , hard floors and bread and water .
neil pearce , london , england " e have hard currency , the russians have unused prison camps in siberia , and i 'm sure they would be delighted to take the drug pushers , muggers , rapists and paedophiles off our hands " guy hammond , england the solution to overcrowded prisons is obvious .
we have hard currency , the russians have unused prison camps in siberia , and i 'm sure they would be delighted to take the drug pushers , muggers , rapists and paedophiles off our hands at a much lower cost than running prisons or tagging schemes in the uk .
guy hammond , england to chris b - you ca n't label these people as prisoners !
they are criminals .
imprisonment is an ancient and out dated form of punishment .
it is costly to the innocent as we pay through our taxes .
if we build more prisons we will have less money to spend on other things like health care or schools .
we need a modern form of punishment , one that shows how we have advanced as a society , not how we are all to eager to push away and hide the product of human greed .
let 's get these people out and educate them , show them that they are a part of humanity and they can make a positive contribution .
chris warwick , uk i fail to comprehend how releasing prisoners into a society in which most crimes remain unsolved , and in which the crime rate is - not surprisingly - soaring , is going to reduce crime .
this week 's favourite phrase : " cut re-offending " , is a poor whitewash of an excuse made by an incompetent home secretary who has no concept of cause and effect , and who is consequently at a complete loss for a sensible strategy .
the bottom line is the need to cut crime - and we will never achieve that by emptying criminals out of the prisons and back onto the streets .
all that achieves is the provision of more fodder for the police , the courts , and society in general to have to cope with .
chris b , england the majority of the subscribers to this debate have focussed upon the criminals and not the victims .
releasing these parasites to prey upon other innocent victims is a typical left wing bleeding heart liberal attitude and effectively tells the community that the criminals ' welfare comes before their victims ' welfare .
ralph e snape , england if someone is out , and tag and they kill someone , that is in my eye murder by the state or are failing us miserably , be it health , law and order , justice , europe , public transport the list is endless .
sven , uk after visiting a number of prisons throughout the uk i can confirm there are many inmates who should never have been incarerated in the first place .

mart , canada after visiting a number of prisons throughout the uk i can confirm there are many inmates who , should never have been incarcerated in the first place .
ner do wells , opportunists and socially inadequate individuals , psychiatric cases make up the bulk of the prison population .
they are in prison because " society " is unable or , unwilling , to provide sheltered working environments for them .
either way , you pay via prisons or , social services .
take your pick .
i would prefer the social services route .
mart , canada it seems to me that we send too many offenders to prison , for too many reasons which have more to do with fear than rehabilitation .
policies such as zero tolerance and the war on drugs are merely fascism under a different name , placebos for middle-class anxieties , meaningless political rhetoric .
excuses for and amelioration of a media produced anxiety .
all criminalization does is produce another unemployable underclass .
make the choice either return to the 17th century and hang every offender or look for an alternative way of accepting crime socially , realistically , but do not make the mistake of imprisoning too many because that remedy has been discredited since the early 18th century .
it merely hardens offenders george stainer , uk corporate-run prisons are the fastest growing industry in the usa , which , ironically , has the most prisoners per-capita than any other country .
does this practice benefit anyone but the stockholders in these corporations ?
do these corporations have lobbyists who influence government toward greater and greater levels of incarceration for non-violent crime ?
i am not familiar with the severity of crime in britain but i do know that in my country the policy of " lock ' em up and throw away the key " only ruins families and prevents a lot of nice people who screwed up from being assets to society .
i strongly support the use of electronic monitoring instead of prison because it enables a human being to live their life while preventing further offences .
it is a well known fact in this country that a jail-sentence often ruins many more lives than the petty , victimless , crime that put them there .
anthony stephenson , usa simple - harsher punisment equals less crime equals less jails and the need to tag .
the uk has got into this situation by being too soft and tagging is another form of being too soft .
the crime rate on the isle of man is minimal as the law is very hard and people realise if your not prepared to do the time - do n't do the crime .
get tough , get real and up the punishment - slapping a pretty wrist tag on somebody and telling them to stay in is not a punishment - its a big cop out !
david lj , isle of man uk " if you have too little prison space , build another prison " stephen , usa one talking point asks " will street crime crackdown work ? " and another asks " should offenders be released early ? "
i see a crackdown and an early release working as opposite effects of each other .
a revolving door , a criminal gets arrested , spends a tiny bit of time in jail only to be released with a little bracelet on their wrist ?
hardly a " crackdown " eh ?
more like a silly joke .
this is n't rocket science ; if you have too little prison space , build another prison .
stephen , usa how can this government ever expect any proposal to work when ministers are more concerned with banning hunting with dogs than with getting the country 's health , education and justice systems working effectively ?
roisin lamprell , england , uk i think it 's an idea but not a long-term solution .
i do n't know what i have against it but it just does n't seem like a good idea to me .
they 've committed a crime ; i think they should serve their punishment .
jen , uk " prison overcrowding can only be resolved by building more prisons " kevin j , uk all this is about is to cut costs and save the government money .
prison overcrowding can only be resolved by building more prisons .
electronic tagging may well stop re-offending while the tag is on , take it off and they 'll just re-offend .
so what 's he going on about !
more prisons need to be built , the whole justice system needs to be evaluated and offenders need educating and taught skills so they 're given a chance for when they 're released back into society .
i do n't think electronic tagging is the answer at all .
kevin j , uk once again the uk government is trying the cheap solution .
why do n't they just increase capacity of the prison system by using certain inmates for more public service and tagging them ?
and then tagging prisoners who are released after their full term for a certain probation period .
michael , dublin , ireland we could take things a step further , instead of letting them out early , why put them in at all .
by the government 's stats if letting them out early reduces the risk of them committing more crime , then surely not putting them in prison would eradicate it altogether .
paul , england " it 's just a slap in the face for their victims " baz , england there should be no early release for prisoners whatever they were jailed for ; it 's just a slap in the face for their victims .
with the increase in crime we should be taking more positive action , such as building more prisons , recruiting more prison officers and giving longer sentences .
we should be keeping these people of our streets , not sending them home .
baz , england letting out criminals early , playing with statistics and talking tough ...
surely the criminals are quaking in their boots !
i say build extra jails and do not worry about the amount of colour television they will need in their cells .
mike , uk if prisoners are released tagged , who checks the tags as to where they are ?
is it another job for the hard-pressed police forces ?
j. coales , uk in the very same day the government release figures that street crimes , muggings etc , have risen by 25 % we are now contemplating releasing criminals early from prison ? what is the world coming to ? .
i only hope the police are about to announce a huge recruitment campaign as things can only get worse !
james , uk " releasing them a little earlier under controlled conditions , would increase the positive impact criminal punishment brings to the offenders " loz , uk a vast majority of offenders are released before their sentences are complete .
releasing them a little earlier under controlled conditions , would increase the positive impact criminal punishment brings to the offenders .
it would be better for society than the thought of a criminal being released to do as they please , with out superfluous attention of the authorities .
loz , uk anyone who ends up in prison has obviously caused discomfort to another person or persons .
why should we just let them out because they have n't got their own cells ?
mark j , herts , uk mr blunkett has to let convicts out of prison to make room for the success of his crackdown on street crime .
unfortunately the statistics he released demonstrating the " success " of tagging did n't really show the whole picture .
yes only 10 % of those tagged and released early re-offended and were convicted .
however , around 50 % were arrested for various crimes but not convicted .
geoff harding , england " i think the government are simply trying to cut costs and make room in the prisons " emily woodrow , england once a criminal has made the choice to commit a crime it is only right they should be given a punishment .
i think the government are simply trying to cut costs and make room in the prisons .
emily woodrow , england it seems to me that releasing people from prison because of overcrowding is missing the point .
presumably they were sent there because we considered that they deserved it .
how does a problem with the prison population change this ?
all we 're doing is answering the wrong question .
if our judgement says that a custodial sentence is justified and the prisons are full to the brim , then we 'll just have to build more prisons .
perhaps we can reflect on the extent of the malaise in our society whilst we 're laying the bricks paul b , oxfordshire , uk what is the point of prison sentences of weeks in duration ?
prison should be reserved for people who need to be in one for an appreciable period of time on grounds of public safety .
if someone is being sentenced to a couple of weeks or months should n't we find some other way of dealing with them ?
is there any point in people losing jobs and homes for the sake of such insignificant jail terms ?
better to have them making some real restitution for what they have done - something which is already shown to slash recidivism rates .
to the people who say , " build more prisons " i say " let us know where you live so the new ones can be put next door to you " !
andy richards , uk " offenders should not be allowed to have any of their liberties back " dave , uk although i usually have a liberal opinion on this matter i believe that offenders should not be allowed to have any of their liberties back , via this tagging program .
if the crime warrants incarceration , then so be it .
i think we should let the present overcrowding of prisons continue .
only then will the real problems of society and crime be addressed .
will the public be content having twice the amount of offences committed in five years time , -lrb- if crime continues on its latest trend -rrb- just so long as they can say that our prisons are no longer over-crowded ?
to me this would be unacceptable .
dave , uk the overall crime figures show that this government is coping rather well with law and order , so i think this initiative at least deserves a chance .
in my opinion , cutting crime should take priority over the desire to punish wrongdoers , and that seems to be the essence of the argument here .
jon , basingstoke , uk i think mr blunkett should be re-designated the title minister for knee-jerk reactions .
mark humphries , england what about investing some money into more prisons then ?
get tougher and help discourage the repeat offences .
also hit young offenders harder while they are impressionable , tackle the disease , not the symptoms !
tony kenny , uk it depends whether we , as a society , want to punish convicted criminals , or reduce re-offending .
the two aims often conflict with each other .
speaking as someone who has been burgled in the past , i 'm content to see imaginative policies like this used , but only if they can be proven to have a positive effect on levels of crime .
john , england " apart from a very small minority , all offenders in our prisons today will be released sooner or later anyway " mark griffiths , england i say well done david blunkett !
the experience of the last three years of home detention curfew shows that tagging offenders works .
over 90 % complete their sentences successfully which means that contrary to popular newspaper stories , there have been many more success stories than failures .
and let 's face it , apart from a very small minority , all offenders in our prisons today will be released sooner or later anyway .
so let 's ease them back into the community in a controlled way rather than simply throwing them out at the end of their sentence without any support .
should we build more jails ?
this is not the answer .
we already lock up more people per head than any other european country apart from portugal and in order to accommodate a 30 % rise in the prison population it would cost over £ 500m to administer and £ 1bn in building new institutions .
mark griffiths , england talk tough , act weak .
that appears to be the government 's policy on crime .
put a spin on " getting tough " while letting criminals out of jail early .
unfortunately no amount of spin and propaganda will convince the victims or friends and family of victims who are also voters and taxpayers .
alex keenleyside , england " am i the only one who can see the irony here ? "
james crosby , telford , england on wednesday we were being told that criminals were going to be targeted in a crackdown on crime .
the next day we 're told that the best way to stop them from re-offending is to release them before their sentences are completed .
am i the only one who can see the irony here ?
james crosby , telford , england we are already too lenient on criminals , so why are we now letting them out early ?
james edwards , england we had that in the united states for decades .
we 've released these kinds of people for one reason or another early and many of them went out to commit more crimes .
some of our state legislatures have reacted against this practice by enacting minimum sentences that neither judges nor parole boards can overrule .
learn from our past mistakes .
mark , usa to : geir in norway , comparisons between europe and usa or usa with canada are not valid because europe dumped its criminals on the us and it is still occurring that the us receives a high percentage of outright criminals from other countries .
visit baltimore or d.c. and take a stroll on a summer night .
john w. shirley , usa to mark in the usa : ask yourself why the crime rate in canada is so much lower than in the us , and perhaps you may have to revise some of your opinions about criminal behaviour .
it is no longer politically correct to speak about the social causes of crime in the uk , and it never has been in the us .
but if people in these two countries were not so self-obsessed , and were willing to find out why other countries have lower crime rates , then perhaps they might have been able to tackle rising crime rates in a manner that is worthy of democratic states , and not speak of police state-syle zero tolerance .

at the time , opposition mps mocked the suggestion , while police officers dismissed it as impractical .
civil rights campaigners said it was asking the police to monitor social behaviour .
however , pilot schemes will now be carried out by five police forces across the uk .
can on-the-spot fines work ?
will they help reduce public disorder ?
or will they give the police too much power ?

us president george bush has said he will sign a bill to cap gifts of money from corporations and individuals to political parties .
currently there are no restrictions on the size of cash donations to us political parties and an estimated $ 498m was donated during the 2000 election campaign .
supporters of the bill say that it will end politicians ' obligations to big business and make them more accountable to american voters .
the unregulated donations are known as ' soft money ' and are largely used to fund television advertising .
under the bill , soft money contributions will be limited to $ 10,000 .
will the reforms encourage more people to take part in the democratic process ?
has too much money spoilt political campaigning ?

your reaction american people are treated like mushrooms : we are kept in the dark and fed manure .
most are worked too hard to grow culturally .
the arts are denigrated , sports are glorified .
american corporations seek to extend the philosophy of profit throughout the world without regard for the nation of their birth .
there is now in the united states an " aristocracy " of more than a million millionaires .
also there exists an aristocracy of " career " politicians whose children become politicians .
where is the hope ?
rome went this way .
it became too rich .
joseph gregoire , usa the politicians are all just mad because the party is over and they have to all go back to work !
eric , us corruption of democratic government is the key problem in western society today paul connor , canada corruption of democratic government is the key problem in western society today .
i am glad to see it being addressed in any way .
governments ' economic power and assets are delivered into the hands of the business community at cut-rate prices , in return for campaign finance , directorships and much more .
this is not economic liberalism , you anti-globalisation protesters , no matter what business leaders say !
it is a giant corrupt wealth-concentration machine .
what we need is more democracy , not less economic freedom .
the link some americans draw between freedom of speech and campaign finance ignores the fact that true liberalism requires guarantees of democracy , even where they constrain freedom slightly .
who would advocate allowing corporations to operate the core functions of government , like the legislature , police or courts ?
obviously some restrictions are reasonable , and campaign finance reform provides one such reasonable stricture .
paul connor , canada an incumbent legislature will never do anything to undermine their own support .
this bill is simply ' eye candy ' to make the politicians look good .
businesses and politicians will find a way to skirt around this law , if they have n't already .
justin , usa it never ceases to amaze me how little voters actually think for themselves .
they 'll just tow the line and believe any heap of rhetoric passed on by politicians and the media to make them think that some socialist-minded politician , usually incapable of making it for themselves in the real world so they become career politicians where hypocrisy is the norm , actually have some corner stone of legislation to stand up for their concerns .
it 's one of the biggest lies i think i 've heard since the days of clinton .
wake up , people , this bill is n't just going to limit corporations , it 's going to limit special interest groups as well , which we all know are just groups of citizens with similar beliefs and concerns who band together to lobby .
this incumbent protection act will simply make it harder for the average joe to play his part in public politics .
to erik , usa , i could n't have said it better myself .
ryan corcoran , austin , tx , usa this is definitely a good bill to pass .
it will lessen the influence of oil and arms companies on the president when he is elected , though it would be best if they were limited across the board , still it 's a start .
tom o 'd , uk real election reform will only come when people stop choosing personalities and start choosing those who are most qualified to do the job arri london , eu / us it is certainly a step in the right direction towards restoring free speech in the us .
as it stands , only the people with the most money get anything resembling free speech .
however , real election reform will only come when people stop choosing personalities and start choosing those who are most qualified to do the job .
this bill wo n't affect that at all .
arri london , eu / us campaign finance rules currently in place are violated regularly , lawbreakers are almost never prosecuted .
rest assured , funds will continue to find their way to politicians and parties on a quid pro quo basis .
conduits may change but the flow will not be abated .
loophole weasels of both parties are laughing at the new rules .
this has been an act performed to give the perception of reform , corrupt public servants need to repent not reform .
j.r. mackie , usa this is only half the battle in getting our politicians to do what they are supposed to do .
i 'm amazed by some of the ways democracy takes hold in europe : for instance , being able to scrap a parliament and hold emergency elections ; holding referenda on a frequent basis to see what the voters really want ; and my personal favourite , " prime minister 's questions " -lrb- it 's on c-span on sunday nights , for my fellow americans who want to give it a look -rrb- .
here tony blair has to sit in front of the commons and take a barrage of questions from mps who truly seem to work for their constituents .
could you imagine george bush doing this ?
tom daschle would have a blast .
the united states might be one of the first federal democratic republics , but there 's no harm in improving on it .
jennifer ethington , usa in an ideal world , political parties would be state funded , with no contributions allowable from private individuals or organised lobbies -lrb- unions on the left , business on the right -rrb- .
ca n't see it happening though .
it would be interesting to see a league table showing how much money the major political parties spend per vote in " developed " countries around the world .
john , england this is called market saturation and i am sick of it because it squeezes out the small guy who also has something to say di stewart , usa this is n't about freedom of speech - this is about having the money to buy enough advertising so that all the people hear what you are saying .
this is called market saturation and i am sick of it because it squeezes out the small guy who also has something to say .
there have been so many viable political candidates who had to drop out of the race because they simply ran out of money .
sure , if corporations want to donate to aid the political process , fine , but they put their money in a common pot , shared by all .
the richest person with an influential power base should n't win elections - and perhaps this law would be a start .
di stewart , usa " congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech " .
first amendment .
looks like someone did n't check the constitution .
frank , usa sorry to ask this question , but is the us really democratic ?
was bush 's presidency valid -lrb- let alone legal -rrb- ?
i seriously believe that each time a truly democratic presidential candidate comes to the fore in the us , they are either assassinated or laughed at -lrb- much as the uk 's politicians laugh at the lib dem. party -rrb- .
food for thought - it should be .
anon , europe i think that this bill is a great step for the us j.kerr , england i think that this bill is a great step for the us .
i admire the us system and way of life , yet i have seen that big money essentially runs us politics .
this would put the ' people ' back into us politics , and may drastically reverse the apathy of many americans who see the election of presidents , senators and representatives as a far-gone conclusion .
j.kerr , england over here in the uk , we know that the u.s. campaigning is all just a big sucking up popularity contest by families with stacks of money , and nothing to do with the issues or actually fixing the problems with the country and making life better .
do n't get me wrong , the uk 's not much better - but at least our leadership candidates are n't picked solely on the basis that they have a huge stack of cash sitting around .
paul charters , england i think the state should provide funds to those politicians that demonstrate they have support .
if america wants to attract it 's best minds into politics , it must ensure the remuneration is comparable with the best of the private sector .
garth , zimbabwe it scares me how much the american political system is the pawn of big business john riddoch , scotland please !
it scares me how much the american political system is the pawn of big business .
look at recent bills passed by them : copyright term was extended to 70 years to allow disney to maintain the mickey mouse copyright , the dmca was pushed through at the behest of corporations , the sssca bill is currently being moved through ...
all of these erode what should be rights of the average american citizen .
while i 'm in the uk , i have few illusions about what will happen if this kind of behaviour becomes acceptable in the us ; they will get inflicted on other countries using either the stick of trade embargoes or the carrot of better trade deals .
john riddoch , scotland it does not matter how many limits are set on donations to political campaigns .
our higher ' elected ' offices will continue to be ' bought ' by the candidates with the most money , excluding the common man .
steve , usa do i care ?
no .
perhaps if you were discussing british politics i would comment .
does this really effect / concern the bbc 's target readership -lrb- uk residents -rrb- ?
nick brown , uk it 's a good idea , but any form of economic contribution to politics is de-facto corruption and should be explicitly forbidden .
instead , government should give grants tied to membership size .
qafir letiand , denmark that 's a fundamental violation of our sacred first amendment rights gary , us you people are fools .
all this bill does is prevent ordinary citizens from buying time on tv or placing ads critical of incumbents .
you can not say ' bad ' things about a candidate within 2 months of the election !
that 's a fundamental violation of our sacred first amendment rights .
the only winners are the big national tv networks , political chat show hosts , and newspaper editors .
who do you think is going to raise all the $ 2000 per head of hard money ?
the challengers or the incumbents ?
this is a cynical deal made by politicians to muzzle the people and stay in office .
oh , by the way , mccain inserted a little extra provision to allow candidates to take unlimited soft money from indian tribes ... like the ones in arizona with the casinos .
boy , what principle !
oh yeah , this little attack on the constitution does n't apply to the next elections so they can all run right out and call the teachers unions , the teamsters , the movie industry , or whatever special interest group that they can get to fill up that war chest in the near term .
how can people be so deluded about this ?
gary , us president bush signed the bill , though he stated that many parts were " flawed " .
most americans favour some form of campaign reform .
this bill , however , is more about the right to communicate -lrb- free speech -rrb- and the abrogation of one of the rights granted to americans by the bill of rights .
the only winners in this bill , which will be struck down as unconstitutional by the united states supreme court on several points , are incumbent politicians who want to hold onto their power and the liberal press , which may say anything - lie , exaggerate , profile , etc.-to curry favour with the democratic political machines in power in the large cities of our country .
i invite our world readers to visit rushlimbaugh.com , our nation 's top-rated radio commentator , to get a realistic view of this bill .
in polls , his views are generally what the average educated american is in agreement with .
thomas , chicago , usa i 'm relatively pleased that there is an effort being made to combat the corruption in campaign financing .
however , i 'm sure there are big corporations out there forming special committees at this moment , trying to work out all the little loopholes before the next election .
i have n't heard anything about controlling the " hard " money .
so i 'm guessing that 's where the loopholes will be .
welcome to the united corporations of america .
where big conglomerates rip off the citizens , strip them of their rights , gobble up their resources , pollute their land , and then use taxpayers ' money to repair the damages .
i guess i 'm too cynical to get overly excited over this reform bill .
but i suppose it 's a start .
aa , us money does n't get you elected - votes get you elected , money is just a way to influence voters martin , england , uk money does n't get you elected - votes get you elected , money is just a way to influence voters .
so , the core problem is not contributions to political parties per say .
it is the fact that voters are taken in by the glitz .
simply put , if voters paid attention and voted on substance , not style , based their decisions on practicalities , not propaganda , then the contributions would fall off dramatically by themselves .
ask yourself , " is your vote for sale today ? "
martin , england , uk this bill is definitely worth passing .
for the past millennium we have been dictated by two political parties that do not seem to be competent .
it 's about time that parties , such as the green party , can have an equal chance .
derek woods , usa i can assure you that any " reform " will guarantee the incumbent a job for life .
colin butts , usa any steps taken to curb corruption are good , certainly , but there is a much more direct solution for the american voter : know the issues , know the candidates , and stop being impressed by clever slogans , pretty pictures and meaningless tv commercials .
maybe that 's too much to hope for ?
c. neron , us every time campaign finance is " reformed " by incumbents , guess what ? - incumbents solidify their power erik , usa every time campaign finance is " reformed " by incumbents , guess what ? - incumbents solidify their power .
incumbents already have nearly free press access due to their notoriety -lrb- office -rrb- and taxpayer-funded franking privileges .
we have an aristocracy of perpetual politicians , rather than electing citizen legislators .
with h. clinton in the senate , this ruling class is no longer even tied to its geographic constituency but cantered in the new imperial rome .
it would be nice if joe sixpack were able to break the power of the kennedy 's and political bosses , but if he ca n't , at least let the occasional plutocrat try - he may not be my peer , but at least he 'd be new and perhaps more circumspect in his power .
great evil comes from those who are secure in their power .
i say free the process of contributing to individual candidates -lrb- parties / factions easily fall under " bosses " like we have in chicago and the ones that famously screwed up the election in dade and west palm counties -rrb- .
do n't abolish free speech , return to the american ideal of limited government -lrb- sovereign individuals -rrb- !
then there would be less temptation to ' buy ' elections .
erik , usa the passage of this bill is a step in the right direction , but it will always be a challenge to balance the right to political expression against the need for elected officials who are free from corruption or the mere appearance of corruption .
scott , usa should n't this bill have been incorporated into the american constitution when their " democracy " was first established ?
so , even though citizens get to vote , it ultimately depends on who -lrb- multi-billion dollar corporations -rrb- chips in the most .
i always said democracy was simply a word found in the dictionary , and a clever tactic to quell the masses by making them think that they have a say .
now this is the proof .
at least they 're taking half a step in the right direction .
wisdom , australia everyone talks about curbing corporations but the unions are as bad if not worse .
let 's hope this is just the first step in the right direction .
jim , usa putting caps on soft money donations restricts free speech wade , usa putting caps on soft money donations restricts free speech .
in addition to limiting soft money contributions , this campaign finance reform bill does not allow any criticism of incumbents two months before an election .
this will slam the door on most people trying to enter politics by protecting those already in power .
this point will be brought before the supreme court before too long , where the bill may be found unconstitutional .
wade , usa reading this page , it sounds to me that most are cynical of politic 's relationship with capitalism , but many also admit to being powerless to do anything about it .
just think of that next time you proudly exclaim that you live in a democracy !
if the demos , -lrb- people -rrb- , want direct power then all you got to do is take it !
it does after all rightly belong to all of us ?
dave , uk it is about time the elected leaders took this matter seriously .
let 's see how long it will be before another law is needed to stop all the loopholes .
at least an attempt is being made despite its effectiveness .
brian , us much ado about nothing .
nothing has changed , except the politician can beat upon his breast .
a new rule simply means 100 new loopholes and a thousand new institutions .
one can not regulate expenditures on advertising in a nation which protects free speech .
george milton , usa and italy if money flows to one candidate rather than another what business is it of the government ?
robert a dreadful idea by two of the most pompous members of an already over-pompous senate .
if money flows to one candidate rather than another what business is it of the government ?
freedom of speech should mean that political candidates , like everyone else , should be able to get their message to the people any way they can .
what is so wrong with business that it is presumed to be in constant cahoots to turn all legislation in its favour .
if americans had half a wit , which i doubt , they could recognize bad governance and toss the bums where they belong .
they should start with both mccain and feingold .
robert it does state in the declaration of independence , that politicians are supposed to pledge their lives , fortunes and sacred honour to the cause !
i fail to see how campaign reform will do more than cutting noses off despite faces ! !
bj pinkerton , usa here in the us the principle has always been , " one dollar , one vote . "
i have faith that the us supreme court will strike down any challenge to this rule .
tom donaly thomas donaly , usa of course , of course , like everything else in america it is spoiled by too much free money .
limit the donation amounts to the politicians and maybe they wo n't be so blasé about allowing marketing companies to use and abuse people 's privacy .
it might even turn america into a semi-sensible country and away from one that is powered by greed , advertising and insurance companies .
kevin b. , brit in usa i have no doubt that , in the course of time , the federal courts will throw this legislation out ray hanson , usa the first amendment to the constitution of the united states is a fundamental guarantee of freedom of speech in our country .
this law violates , mutilates both the spirit and the letter of this amendment .
i have no doubt that , in the course of time , the federal courts will throw this legislation out and shame the drooling twits who foisted it upon us .
ray hanson , usa this bill allows " hard money " caps to be doubled compared to previous limits , only " soft money " is reduced .
also the part of this bill which blatantly violates our right to free speech virtually assures incumbents to remain in office , for the 30 and 60 day " blackout periods " will stifle the views of challengers far more than the incumbents .
once the special interests adapt to the new law , this bill will indeed increase the influence special interests have , not reduce it and make the system even more corrupt than ever .
stephen , usa when i vote for a politician i want him or her to work exclusively for me ; that means , for the voter and taxpayer .
politicians should not be allowed to accept money from anyone else .
manu , belgium no matter how many laws you pass money will find its way into politics paul m. neville , jackson , ms , usa as the former chairman of common cause in mississippi i 've had some experience in campaign finance reform .
trust me no matter how many laws you pass money will find its way into politics because of the prohibitive cost of tv .
the only solution is for the people to learn they have a duty to contribute as well as a duty to vote .
paul m. neville , jackson , ms , usa the mccain-feingold bill will significantly improve the current situation .
however i am sure that with the passage of time the lobbies and lobbyists will find methods to bypass the law and once again exert pressure on us legislators .
you just wait !
mirek kondracki , usa this is fantastic news .
it is about time that ethics and intellect governed this planet , and not cash .
america has deluded its people that they are living in a democracy , when we all know , the man in the street has no power at all .
i lived there 10 years and witnessed this .
alex , england how about going back to ancient greek ideals where the citizens turned up for every issue and had a show of hands ?
with today 's technology this should be possible electronically , but as it would erode the position of politicians i suspect it will never happen .
jo , canada a victory for the common man we can all be proud of keith cuiper , denver , usa i am thrilled about the long awaited passage of this bill .
we americans are in desperate need of campaign finance reform to protect our democracy .
senators feingold and mccain deserve a lot of praise for their perseverance .
finally , a victory for the common man we can all be proud of .
keith cuiper , denver , usa the situation is so bad that i suppose it 's worth trying something , i suppose .
but i will withhold judgement about this new law until i see it put in practice for a few election cycles -lrb- assuming it is n't nullified by the courts before then -rrb- .
in all likelihood , this measure will increase the advantage of incumbency and increase the influence of wealthy individuals .
the poor and working class wo n't be able to afford $ 2000 contributions , but the wealthy will be able to contribute twice the current $ 1000 limit .
howard , usa i am a resident of new york city and was shocked when michael bloomberg , a billionaire media mogul , spent $ 75 million of his own money to become mayor of new york city .
in my opinion , such legislation was long overdue .
cheers to senator john mccain for helping make this happen .
christian gough , usa al stated , " companies answer to consumers " .
give me a break !
who do you think creates the demand through their constant advertising ?
corporations rule , and i seriously doubt that campaign finance reform will put any damper on their manipulation .
richard , usa companies ultimately answer to consumers al , usa the invisible hand of market forces dictates everything in america because it is a free-market driven democracy .
everything i consume , from food to entertainment to the government itself is dictated and manipulated by companies .
but companies ultimately answer to consumers whose preferences influence the actions of companies .
demand creates supply .
al , usa an excellent plan from a surprising source .
good fallout from enron ?
kate , uk it is definitely a great principle but i doubt that it will prevent cash for favours or any of the corporate corruption present in america 's political system .
the ' democracy ' of the american political system is always paying favour to the friends and relatives of particular corporate conglomerates to the point of oligarchy .
only when the masses are represented by an unbounded president will policy be directed for the good of the people rather than corporate success .
phil , uk this legislation will kill off many of those backroom deals michael boh , los angeles , us i 'm thrilled that congress finally took action after so many bad people blocked this progressive legislation for so many years .
good can win in the end .
despite all objections , mostly by republicans -lrb- secretly backed by bush -rrb- this legislation will level the playing field and kill off many of those backroom deals that had little input from the honest electorate .
democracy works if good people act .
michael boh , los angeles , us big business , commercialism and money will always have a huge influence on us politics , so why bother ?
matt , uk i 'm sick of our government catering to the corporations regina , us i definitely think that this is a good idea .
i 'm sick and tired of our government catering to the corporations at the expense of the average citizen .

there have been so many viable political candidates who had to drop out of the race because they simply ran out of money .
sure , if corporations want to donate to aid the political process , fine , but they put their money in a common pot , shared by all .
the richest person with an influential power base should n't win elections - and perhaps this law would be a start .
di stewart , usa " congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech " .
first amendment .
looks like someone did n't check the constitution .
frank , usa sorry to ask this question , but is the us really democratic ?
was bush 's presidency valid -lrb- let alone legal -rrb- ?
i seriously believe that each time a truly democratic presidential candidate comes to the fore in the us , they are either assassinated or laughed at -lrb- much as the uk 's politicians laugh at the lib dem. party -rrb- .
food for thought - it should be .
anon , europe " i think that this bill is a great step for the us " j.kerr , england i think that this bill is a great step for the us .
i admire the us system and way of life , yet i have seen that big money essentially runs us politics .
this would put the ' people ' back into us politics , and may drastically reverse the apathy of many americans who see the election of presidents , senators and representatives as a far-gone conclusion .
j.kerr , england over here in the uk , we know that the u.s. campaigning is all just a big sucking up popularity contest by families with stacks of money , and nothing to do with the issues or actually fixing the problems with the country and making life better .
do n't get me wrong , the uk 's not much better - but at least our leadership candidates are n't picked solely on the basis that they have a huge stack of cash sitting around .
paul charters , england i think the state should provide funds to those politicians that demonstrate they have support .
if america wants to attract it 's best minds into politics , it must ensure the remuneration is comparable with the best of the private sector .
garth , zimbabwe " it scares me how much the american political system is the pawn of big business " john riddoch , scotland please !
it scares me how much the american political system is the pawn of big business .
look at recent bills passed by them : copyright term was extended to 70 years to allow disney to maintain the mickey mouse copyright , the dmca was pushed through at the behest of corporations , the sssca bill is currently being moved through ...
all of these erode what should be rights of the average american citizen .
while i 'm in the uk , i have few illusions about what will happen if this kind of behaviour becomes acceptable in the us ; they will get inflicted on other countries using either the stick of trade embargoes or the carrot of better trade deals .
john riddoch , scotland it does not matter how many limits are set on donations to political campaigns .
our higher ' elected ' offices will continue to be ' bought ' by the candidates with the most money , excluding the common man .
steve , usa do i care ?
no .
perhaps if you were discussing british politics i would comment .
does this really effect / concern the bbc 's target readership -lrb- uk residents -rrb- ?
nick brown , uk it 's a good idea , but any form of economic contribution to politics is de-facto corruption and should be explicitly forbidden .
instead , government should give grants tied to membership size .
qafir letiand , denmark " that 's a fundamental violation of our sacred first amendment rights " gary , us you people are fools .
all this bill does is prevent ordinary citizens from buying time on tv or placing ads critical of incumbents .
you can not say ' bad ' things about a candidate within 2 months of the election !
that 's a fundamental violation of our sacred first amendment rights .
the only winners are the big national tv networks , political chat show hosts , and newspaper editors .
who do you think is going to raise all the $ 2000 per head of hard money ?
the challengers or the incumbents ?
this is a cynical deal made by politicians to muzzle the people and stay in office .
oh , by the way , mccain inserted a little extra provision to allow candidates to take unlimited soft money from indian tribes ... like the ones in arizona with the casinos .
boy , what principle !
oh yeah , this little attack on the constitution does n't apply to the next elections so they can all run right out and call the teachers unions , the teamsters , the movie industry , or whatever special interest group that they can get to fill up that war chest in the near term .
how can people be so deluded about this ?
gary , us president bush signed the bill , though he stated that many parts were " flawed " .
most americans favour some form of campaign reform .
this bill , however , is more about the right to communicate -lrb- free speech -rrb- and the abrogation of one of the rights granted to americans by the bill of rights .
the only winners in this bill , which will be struck down as unconstitutional by the united states supreme court on several points , are incumbent politicians who want to hold onto their power and the liberal press , which may say anything - lie , exaggerate , profile , etc.-to curry favour with the democratic political machines in power in the large cities of our country .

thomas , chicago , usa i 'm relatively pleased that there is an effort being made to combat the corruption in campaign financing .
however , i 'm sure there are big corporations out there forming special committees at this moment , trying to work out all the little loopholes before the next election .
i have n't heard anything about controlling the " hard " money .
so i 'm guessing that 's where the loopholes will be .
welcome to the united corporations of america .
where big conglomerates rip off the citizens , strip them of their rights , gobble up their resources , pollute their land , and then use taxpayers ' money to repair the damages .
i guess i 'm too cynical to get overly excited over this reform bill .
but i suppose it 's a start .
aa , us " money does n't get you elected - votes get you elected , money is just a way to influence voters " martin , england , uk money does n't get you elected - votes get you elected , money is just a way to influence voters .
so , the core problem is not contributions to political parties per say .
it is the fact that voters are taken in by the glitz .
simply put , if voters paid attention and voted on substance , not style , based their decisions on practicalities , not propaganda , then the contributions would fall off dramatically by themselves .
ask yourself , " is your vote for sale today ? "
martin , england , uk this bill is definitely worth passing .

it 's about time that parties , such as the green party , can have an equal chance .
derek woods , usa i can assure you that any " reform " will guarantee the incumbent a job for life .
colin butts , usa any steps taken to curb corruption are good , certainly , but there is a much more direct solution for the american voter : know the issues , know the candidates , and stop being impressed by clever slogans , pretty pictures and meaningless tv commercials .

c. neron , us " every time campaign finance is " reformed " by incumbents , guess what ? - incumbents solidify their power " erik , usa every time campaign finance is " reformed " by incumbents , guess what ? - incumbents solidify their power .
incumbents already have nearly free press access due to their notoriety -lrb- office -rrb- and taxpayer-funded franking privileges .

with h. clinton in the senate , this ruling class is no longer even tied to its geographic constituency but cantered in the new imperial rome .
it would be nice if joe sixpack were able to break the power of the kennedy 's and political bosses , but if he ca n't , at least let the occasional plutocrat try - he may not be my peer , but at least he 'd be new and perhaps more circumspect in his power .
great evil comes from those who are secure in their power .
i say free the process of contributing to individual candidates -lrb- parties / factions easily fall under " bosses " like we have in chicago and the ones that famously screwed up the election in dade and west palm counties -rrb- .
do n't abolish free speech , return to the american ideal of limited government -lrb- sovereign individuals -rrb- !
then there would be less temptation to ' buy ' elections .
erik , usa the passage of this bill is a step in the right direction , but it will always be a challenge to balance the right to political expression against the need for elected officials who are free from corruption or the mere appearance of corruption .
scott , usa should n't this bill have been incorporated into the american constitution when their " democracy " was first established ?
so , even though citizens get to vote , it ultimately depends on who -lrb- multi-billion dollar corporations -rrb- chips in the most .
i always said democracy was simply a word found in the dictionary , and a clever tactic to quell the masses by making them think that they have a say .
now this is the proof .
at least they 're taking half a step in the right direction .
wisdom , australia everyone talks about curbing corporations but the unions are as bad if not worse .
let 's hope this is just the first step in the right direction .
jim , usa " putting caps on soft money donations restricts free speech " wade , usa putting caps on soft money donations restricts free speech .
in addition to limiting soft money contributions , this campaign finance reform bill does not allow any criticism of incumbents two months before an election .
this will slam the door on most people trying to enter politics by protecting those already in power .
this point will be brought before the supreme court before too long , where the bill may be found unconstitutional .
wade , usa reading this page , it sounds to me that most are cynical of politic 's relationship with capitalism , but many also admit to being powerless to do anything about it .
just think of that next time you proudly exclaim that you live in a democracy !
if the demos , -lrb- people -rrb- , want direct power then all you got to do is take it !
it does after all rightly belong to all of us ?
dave , uk it is about time the elected leaders took this matter seriously .
let 's see how long it will be before another law is needed to stop all the loopholes .
at least an attempt is being made despite its effectiveness .
brian , us much ado about nothing .

if money flows to one candidate rather than another what business is it of the government ?
freedom of speech should mean that political candidates , like everyone else , should be able to get their message to the people any way they can .
what is so wrong with business that it is presumed to be in constant cahoots to turn all legislation in its favour .
if americans had half a wit , which i doubt , they could recognize bad governance and toss the bums where they belong .
they should start with both mccain and feingold .

kevin b. , brit in usa " i have no doubt that , in the course of time , the federal courts will throw this legislation out " ray hanson , usa the first amendment to the constitution of the united states is a fundamental guarantee of freedom of speech in our country .
this law violates , mutilates both the spirit and the letter of this amendment .
i have no doubt that , in the course of time , the federal courts will throw this legislation out and shame the drooling twits who foisted it upon us .
ray hanson , usa this bill allows " hard money " caps to be doubled compared to previous limits , only " soft money " is reduced .
also the part of this bill which blatantly violates our right to free speech virtually assures incumbents to remain in office , for the 30 and 60 day " blackout periods " will stifle the views of challengers far more than the incumbents .
once the special interests adapt to the new law , this bill will indeed increase the influence special interests have , not reduce it and make the system even more corrupt than ever .

in all likelihood , this measure will increase the advantage of incumbency and increase the influence of wealthy individuals .

demand creates supply .
al , usa an excellent plan from a surprising source .
good fallout from enron ?
kate , uk it is definitely a great principle but i doubt that it will prevent cash for favours or any of the corporate corruption present in america 's political system .
the ' democracy ' of the american political system is always paying favour to the friends and relatives of particular corporate conglomerates to the point of oligarchy .
only when the masses are represented by an unbounded president will policy be directed for the good of the people rather than corporate success .

high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- talking point contents : forum -pipe- bbc news online : talking point tuesday , 26 march , 2002 , 08:44 gmt does england need regional assemblies ?
there is big support in the regions of england for devolving power from westminster to elected regional assemblies , according to a new poll commissioned by the bbc .
almost two-thirds of people -lrb- 63 % -rrb- want regional government , according to the survey , with less than a quarter -lrb- 23 % -rrb- opposed to the move .
the poll suggests the most popular reason why people in england would support a regional assembly is to give their area a stronger voice in both westminster and brussels .
the survey also revealed that we classify ourselves more by our local town than by our country - we are more likely to say we are scousers or brummies than say we 're british .
would you like your local area to have more political power ?
do you feel more affinity to your region than england or britain ?
this talking point was suggested by denise , uk : do the english really ' want regional parliaments ' ?
would we end up like the us with its state run schemes ?

your reaction to john of france , yes we do love paying our taxes over here because overall we pay some of the lowest taxes in europe .
another level of bureaucracy sounds like a nightmare but if it means this country becoming less london-centric then i 'm all for it .
tarun patel , england regional assemblies are not enough !
what england needs is independence from its moaning british siblings .
anthony walmsley , uk " regional government ... another level of politicians to drain our taxes ? "
peter , uk regional government ... another level of politicians to drain our taxes ?
or a professional administration to replace the rag-bag chaos of county councils , district councils , parish councils , single administrative authorities , city councils and all the other people playing at running our lives ?
would a regional council allow the delay and confusion currently occurring between bristol and south glosterchire over the rapid transit rail system ?
i think not ...
let 's go for the single authority to replace the chaos and save time and money !
peter , uk absolutely - the sooner the economy of the south east is freed from subsidising the rest of britain , the better !
guy hammond , england if the english had their own parliament , as do the scots , welsh and irish , then regional government would not be an issue .
i have seen numerous english fans out here flying the union flag at the cricket games .
the english do n't know the difference between being english and british .
keith gethen , australia as a merseyside resident i just ca n't wait to have all the political decisions for the region made in manchester ...
not !
andy , uk , liverpool yes , an assembly today and finally a republic of yorkshire .
no more nonsense from these fancy southerners and their lacastrian friends .
i look forward to singing ' ilkley moor ' as the newly formed yorkshire football team win the world cup !
andrew p , yorkshire " scotland and wales are one thing , the balkanising of england 's another " desmond , uk scotland and wales are one thing , the balkanising of england 's another .
what ' regions ' ?
what are these ' regions ' ?
how do residents of these ' regions ' identify themselves ?
are there not enough toothless assemblies in the uk already ?
how about decent county and city authorities who can actually do something that matters to their citizens ' lives without being crippled by central government interference ?
let 's give londoners the right to decide how to run the underground , and the residents of yorkshire and warwickshire the right to decide if they 'll permit fox hunting or not .
the natural internal boundaries of our nation are cultural ones , based upon the differences in attitudes between , for example , rural and urban areas , not the simplistic north , south , east , and west ones .
desmond , uk devolution has been a waste of time and money .
it was done in haste and without thinking through the whole issue of the british constitution .
that is , does the uk need a federal system or not ?
a federal system a 100 years ago may have " solved " the " irish problem " .
this partial devolution is a failure .
some regional autonomy , not " national " is what is needed to develop the economies of those regions .
this is particularly true of the scottish highlands and islands who will continue to suffer under the scottish parliament .
david , canada when wales and scotland gained parliaments , england should have got one by default .
there should be no need for a referendum , but an automatic english parliament .
some years ago blair was asked " is there to be an english parliament ? "
he said , " there has been no call for one " .
well we 're calling for one now !
k young , england " more of the european agenda by the back door " bill bell , uk more of the european agenda by the back door along with a further opportunity to distance itself from any form of responsibility .
go for it - you know it makes sense .
bill bell , uk i see they are at it again !
the government i mean .
prescott has decided all on his own that 1000 year-old counties are to be abolished .
this is the real reason that labour are touting regional assemblies .
more divide and rule .
well , he wo n't get away with it .
england needs a parliament so it can run its own country without subsidising any others .
r. anderson , usa i would most certainly support a national assembly for england .
i 'm not so sure about regional assemblies .
are we not divisive enough already ?
this small island of great britain has more in common with it 's fellow nations than it gives it self credit for .
what happened to " united we stand , divided we fall " ?
would we really be better off as separate nations , or are we just pandering to foolish pride ?
matt jamieson , england " you want yet another level of government for the regions ?
areas of land that are insignificantly small ? "
alex c. , australia you want yet another level of government for the regions ?
areas of land that - not just from an australian perspective - are insignificantly small ?
how tribal !
strange that we are taught to regard europeans as sophisticated .
alex c. , australia what we need is fewer politicians with greater powers .
we also need to give them the ability to actually implement policy decisions more quickly .
if people then saw the effects -lrb- good and bad -rrb- and could associate those responsible we 'd encourage more interest in voting .
neil pearce , london , england why should england be more devolved than scotland , wales or northern ireland ?
more importantly , it is wrong that non-english constituent mp 's at westminster have the ability to vote on issues which are only relevant to english constituencies .
damian johnson , england " i live in harlow and currently have the dubious honour of paying the highest council tax in the country for some of the poorest services " james miller , uk i live in harlow and currently have the dubious honour of paying the highest council tax in the country for some of the poorest services .
do i want to pay even more for another tier of ineffective government run by self-serving hypocrites who would n't recognise a good idea if it hit then in the face ?
i do n't think so !
james miller , uk having english regional assemblies will just provide another layer of bureaucracy and yet more self-serving politicians that we will have to pay for .
paul , england if these costly talking shops are going to be imposed upon us cornwall should get its own assembly rather than being part of a fake euro-region called south west england .
also shetland and orkney should get their own assemblies too rather than being lumped together with scotland .
they once had their own language -lrb- norn -rrb- , have their own flags and feel more scandinavian than scottish .
james wild , uk " county councils should be replaced by larger regional assemblies " michael kilpatrick , cambridge , uk i believe county councils are too small and too unempowered to be of any use , and that the district councils , being about a quarter of the size of the counties , are too similar in size .
it seems obvious to me that county councils should be replaced by larger regional assemblies with more clout thus allowing the smaller district and city councils to be more focused on the detail of local affairs .
michael kilpatrick , cambridge , uk does n't it strike you as slightly odd that this government seems intent on splitting up the uk into large regional assemblies - ones that would easily , say , be amenable to some sort of future control by brussels in a britain fully integrated into an eu superstate ?
tim , glos , uk the short answer is no .
although english , i live and work in wales .
as an ' outsider ' , it seems to me that the welsh assembly has been an unmitigated disaster .
there has been no decrease in political chicanery -lrb- e.g. the chamber orchestra funding scandel -rrb- , no increase in efficiency and the whole thing just costs money -lrb- witness the multi-million pound farce that masquerades as the new assembly building -rrb- .
the recent outcry in north and central wales over the decision to award newport city status , cited as further evidence of a massive south wales bias , suggests that such assemblies merely serve to relocate the big fish of government to a much smaller pond .
in fact , the only solution to the north-south argument in wales is probably regional welsh devolution ! ! !
paul kenton , uk " the scottish parliament has been a complete and utter waste of time and money and i seriously regret ever voting for it " michael , scotland , uk being scottish and having voted yes in our referendum for devolution my advice would be to think long and hard about what your region would be creating .
since it was set up , the scottish parliament has in my opinion been a complete and utter waste of time and money and i seriously regret ever having thought of voting for it .
the cost of the new building is spiralling out of control , msps go against public opinion , they debate nonsense issues and vote to award themselves higher salaries and more holidays , with no second tier house to stop them .
even now they complain about being paid less than westminster mps .
if i could turn back time , i would send them homeward to think again .
i 'm scottish and i 'm proud of that .
but since the creation of the parliament i 've realised that we did n't need any more red tape to affirm our identity .
we also did n't need any more politicians to run local affairs -lrb- the scottish office took care of most of that -rrb- .
nationalists would of course disagree , but i helped create a disaster .
michael , scotland , uk all this would mean is that we would see more politicians , more beauracracy and more money wasted on talking shops .
steve , england " centralised power has proven under labour that it is inefficient and ignorant to the needs of provincial britain " j kerr , england i 'd welcome regional assemblies - centralised power has proven under labour that it is inefficient and ignorant to the needs of provincial britain .
regional assemblies would also appreciate the needs of the local community they are responsible for , and would probably deal with such a situation more effectively then westminster .
the regional power bases of the us have showed that good government can arise from a compromise between state power and federal weight .
i ca n't see why such a balance could not be struck in the uk .
j kerr , england as a yorkshire man , i suppose i should feel as much regional pride as anyone .
however , given the appalling performance of some of our local authorities and councils - many of whose members would doubtless make up such an assembly - i think this would be a recipe for disaster .
also , what exactly would these assemblies do , apart from spend money ?
better the devil you know , if you ask me .
anthony jones , uk " the sooner we get our own assembly in cornwall with real powers , the better for all concerned " phil t , oman being cornish , i would welcome a regional assembly .
for years now we have had successive governments whose main concerns have centred around london and the south east of england .
it has caused a lot of animosity throughout the british isles and giving local regions more say in how their money is spent is a good idea .
cornwall is considered one of the poorest areas in europe and has objective one status , yet we receive back from the british government £ 350 million per year less than what we pay in taxes .
how can this shortfall be justified , especially when successive governments manage to waste over £ 800 million on a dome , which is continuing to cost taxpayers money ?
the objective one status means that there is money available for development from the eu .
however , in order to get that money our government has to equal the amount that the eu is prepared to give .
so far , our government will only match a proportion of what the eu is willing to give .
the sooner we get our own assembly in cornwall with real powers , the better for all concerned .
phil t , oman regional assemblies are fine in principle , but a number of key issues would have to be resolved .
firstly , would the assemblies have revenue raising powers .
if so , would n't this simply increase the burden on local residents ?
remember council tax in london was raised by a significant amount to pay for the gla .
secondly how would the assemblies sit with other regional bodies such as chambers and rdas .
finally , those in the other regions keen on having their own should ask themselves what benefits london has received from having one .
garry waddell , uk you really enjoy paying your taxes over there do n't you .
has anybody given any thought to the cost of setting up a complete tier of administration ?
just think of all those highly paid executives itching to get your tax money , so they can an empire build at your expense .
simple question , has the employing of thousands of administrators , pen pushers all , improved the treatment that your health service now offers ?
john , france ian - you are 100 % correct .
but remember that no system is perfect ; french , british or otherwise .
i am in strong favour of decentralization .
whether britain ends up a federal nation or not has yet to be scripted .
what must be understood is that for decentralization to actually work , power must be handed from the central government in westminster to the regional or country assemblies .
alex , france / usa john , france has had a regional system of government since 1982 .
granted the regions do n't have real power , but i do n't see the french complaining .
they seem to be the most over governed nation from local government upwards .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- does england need regional assemblies ?
categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 26 march , 2002 , 08:44 gmt does england need regional assemblies ?
there is big support in the regions of england for devolving power from westminster to elected regional assemblies , according to a new poll commissioned by the bbc .
almost two-thirds of people -lrb- 63 % -rrb- want regional government , according to the survey , with less than a quarter -lrb- 23 % -rrb- opposed to the move .
the poll suggests the most popular reason why people in england would support a regional assembly is to give their area a stronger voice in both westminster and brussels .
the survey also revealed that we classify ourselves more by our local town than by our country - we are more likely to say we are scousers or brummies than say we 're british .
would you like your local area to have more political power ?
do you feel more affinity to your region than england or britain ?
this talking point was suggested by denise , uk : do the english really ' want regional parliaments ' ?
would we end up like the us with its state run schemes ?

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction to john of france , yes we do love paying our taxes over here because overall we pay some of the lowest taxes in europe .
another level of bureaucracy sounds like a nightmare but if it means this country becoming less london-centric then i 'm all for it .
tarun patel , england regional assemblies are not enough !
what england needs is independence from its moaning british siblings .
anthony walmsley , uk regional government ... another level of politicians to drain our taxes ?
peter , uk regional government ... another level of politicians to drain our taxes ?
or a professional administration to replace the rag-bag chaos of county councils , district councils , parish councils , single administrative authorities , city councils and all the other people playing at running our lives ?
would a regional council allow the delay and confusion currently occurring between bristol and south glosterchire over the rapid transit rail system ?
i think not ...
let 's go for the single authority to replace the chaos and save time and money !
peter , uk absolutely - the sooner the economy of the south east is freed from subsidising the rest of britain , the better !
guy hammond , england if the english had their own parliament , as do the scots , welsh and irish , then regional government would not be an issue .
i have seen numerous english fans out here flying the union flag at the cricket games .
the english do n't know the difference between being english and british .
keith gethen , australia as a merseyside resident i just ca n't wait to have all the political decisions for the region made in manchester ...
not !
andy , uk , liverpool yes , an assembly today and finally a republic of yorkshire .
no more nonsense from these fancy southerners and their lacastrian friends .
i look forward to singing ' ilkley moor ' as the newly formed yorkshire football team win the world cup !
andrew p , yorkshire scotland and wales are one thing , the balkanising of england 's another desmond , uk scotland and wales are one thing , the balkanising of england 's another .
what ' regions ' ?
what are these ' regions ' ?
how do residents of these ' regions ' identify themselves ?
are there not enough toothless assemblies in the uk already ?
how about decent county and city authorities who can actually do something that matters to their citizens ' lives without being crippled by central government interference ?
let 's give londoners the right to decide how to run the underground , and the residents of yorkshire and warwickshire the right to decide if they 'll permit fox hunting or not .
the natural internal boundaries of our nation are cultural ones , based upon the differences in attitudes between , for example , rural and urban areas , not the simplistic north , south , east , and west ones .
desmond , uk devolution has been a waste of time and money .
it was done in haste and without thinking through the whole issue of the british constitution .
that is , does the uk need a federal system or not ?
a federal system a 100 years ago may have " solved " the " irish problem " .
this partial devolution is a failure .
some regional autonomy , not " national " is what is needed to develop the economies of those regions .
this is particularly true of the scottish highlands and islands who will continue to suffer under the scottish parliament .
david , canada when wales and scotland gained parliaments , england should have got one by default .
there should be no need for a referendum , but an automatic english parliament .
some years ago blair was asked " is there to be an english parliament ? "
he said , " there has been no call for one " .
well we 're calling for one now !
k young , england more of the european agenda by the back door bill bell , uk more of the european agenda by the back door along with a further opportunity to distance itself from any form of responsibility .
go for it - you know it makes sense .
bill bell , uk i see they are at it again !
the government i mean .
prescott has decided all on his own that 1000 year-old counties are to be abolished .
this is the real reason that labour are touting regional assemblies .
more divide and rule .
well , he wo n't get away with it .
england needs a parliament so it can run its own country without subsidising any others .
r. anderson , usa i would most certainly support a national assembly for england .
i 'm not so sure about regional assemblies .
are we not divisive enough already ?
this small island of great britain has more in common with it 's fellow nations than it gives it self credit for .
what happened to " united we stand , divided we fall " ?
would we really be better off as separate nations , or are we just pandering to foolish pride ?
matt jamieson , england you want yet another level of government for the regions ?
areas of land that are insignificantly small ?
alex c. , australia you want yet another level of government for the regions ?
areas of land that - not just from an australian perspective - are insignificantly small ?
how tribal !
strange that we are taught to regard europeans as sophisticated .
alex c. , australia what we need is fewer politicians with greater powers .
we also need to give them the ability to actually implement policy decisions more quickly .
if people then saw the effects -lrb- good and bad -rrb- and could associate those responsible we 'd encourage more interest in voting .
neil pearce , london , england why should england be more devolved than scotland , wales or northern ireland ?
more importantly , it is wrong that non-english constituent mp 's at westminster have the ability to vote on issues which are only relevant to english constituencies .
damian johnson , england i live in harlow and currently have the dubious honour of paying the highest council tax in the country for some of the poorest services james miller , uk i live in harlow and currently have the dubious honour of paying the highest council tax in the country for some of the poorest services .
do i want to pay even more for another tier of ineffective government run by self-serving hypocrites who would n't recognise a good idea if it hit then in the face ?
i do n't think so !
james miller , uk having english regional assemblies will just provide another layer of bureaucracy and yet more self-serving politicians that we will have to pay for .
paul , england if these costly talking shops are going to be imposed upon us cornwall should get its own assembly rather than being part of a fake euro-region called south west england .
also shetland and orkney should get their own assemblies too rather than being lumped together with scotland .
they once had their own language -lrb- norn -rrb- , have their own flags and feel more scandinavian than scottish .
james wild , uk county councils should be replaced by larger regional assemblies michael kilpatrick , cambridge , uk i believe county councils are too small and too unempowered to be of any use , and that the district councils , being about a quarter of the size of the counties , are too similar in size .
it seems obvious to me that county councils should be replaced by larger regional assemblies with more clout thus allowing the smaller district and city councils to be more focused on the detail of local affairs .
michael kilpatrick , cambridge , uk does n't it strike you as slightly odd that this government seems intent on splitting up the uk into large regional assemblies - ones that would easily , say , be amenable to some sort of future control by brussels in a britain fully integrated into an eu superstate ?
tim , glos , uk the short answer is no .
although english , i live and work in wales .
as an ' outsider ' , it seems to me that the welsh assembly has been an unmitigated disaster .
there has been no decrease in political chicanery -lrb- e.g. the chamber orchestra funding scandel -rrb- , no increase in efficiency and the whole thing just costs money -lrb- witness the multi-million pound farce that masquerades as the new assembly building -rrb- .
the recent outcry in north and central wales over the decision to award newport city status , cited as further evidence of a massive south wales bias , suggests that such assemblies merely serve to relocate the big fish of government to a much smaller pond .
in fact , the only solution to the north-south argument in wales is probably regional welsh devolution ! ! !
paul kenton , uk the scottish parliament has been a complete and utter waste of time and money and i seriously regret ever voting for it michael , scotland , uk being scottish and having voted yes in our referendum for devolution my advice would be to think long and hard about what your region would be creating .
since it was set up , the scottish parliament has in my opinion been a complete and utter waste of time and money and i seriously regret ever having thought of voting for it .
the cost of the new building is spiralling out of control , msps go against public opinion , they debate nonsense issues and vote to award themselves higher salaries and more holidays , with no second tier house to stop them .
even now they complain about being paid less than westminster mps .
if i could turn back time , i would send them homeward to think again .
i 'm scottish and i 'm proud of that .
but since the creation of the parliament i 've realised that we did n't need any more red tape to affirm our identity .
we also did n't need any more politicians to run local affairs -lrb- the scottish office took care of most of that -rrb- .
nationalists would of course disagree , but i helped create a disaster .
michael , scotland , uk all this would mean is that we would see more politicians , more beauracracy and more money wasted on talking shops .
steve , england centralised power has proven under labour that it is inefficient and ignorant to the needs of provincial britain j kerr , england i 'd welcome regional assemblies - centralised power has proven under labour that it is inefficient and ignorant to the needs of provincial britain .
regional assemblies would also appreciate the needs of the local community they are responsible for , and would probably deal with such a situation more effectively then westminster .
the regional power bases of the us have showed that good government can arise from a compromise between state power and federal weight .
i ca n't see why such a balance could not be struck in the uk .
j kerr , england as a yorkshire man , i suppose i should feel as much regional pride as anyone .
however , given the appalling performance of some of our local authorities and councils - many of whose members would doubtless make up such an assembly - i think this would be a recipe for disaster .
also , what exactly would these assemblies do , apart from spend money ?
better the devil you know , if you ask me .
anthony jones , uk the sooner we get our own assembly in cornwall with real powers , the better for all concerned phil t , oman being cornish , i would welcome a regional assembly .
for years now we have had successive governments whose main concerns have centred around london and the south east of england .
it has caused a lot of animosity throughout the british isles and giving local regions more say in how their money is spent is a good idea .
cornwall is considered one of the poorest areas in europe and has objective one status , yet we receive back from the british government £ 350 million per year less than what we pay in taxes .
how can this shortfall be justified , especially when successive governments manage to waste over £ 800 million on a dome , which is continuing to cost taxpayers money ?
the objective one status means that there is money available for development from the eu .
however , in order to get that money our government has to equal the amount that the eu is prepared to give .
so far , our government will only match a proportion of what the eu is willing to give .
the sooner we get our own assembly in cornwall with real powers , the better for all concerned .
phil t , oman regional assemblies are fine in principle , but a number of key issues would have to be resolved .
firstly , would the assemblies have revenue raising powers .
if so , would n't this simply increase the burden on local residents ?
remember council tax in london was raised by a significant amount to pay for the gla .
secondly how would the assemblies sit with other regional bodies such as chambers and rdas .
finally , those in the other regions keen on having their own should ask themselves what benefits london has received from having one .
garry waddell , uk you really enjoy paying your taxes over there do n't you .
has anybody given any thought to the cost of setting up a complete tier of administration ?
just think of all those highly paid executives itching to get your tax money , so they can an empire build at your expense .
simple question , has the employing of thousands of administrators , pen pushers all , improved the treatment that your health service now offers ?
john , france ian - you are 100 % correct .
but remember that no system is perfect ; french , british or otherwise .
i am in strong favour of decentralization .
whether britain ends up a federal nation or not has yet to be scripted .
what must be understood is that for decentralization to actually work , power must be handed from the central government in westminster to the regional or country assemblies .
alex , france / usa john , france has had a regional system of government since 1982 .
granted the regions do n't have real power , but i do n't see the french complaining .
they seem to be the most over governed nation from local government upwards .
if scotland and wales can have devolution then why ca n't we in the north ?

there was currently no clear indication of who would approve or reject an application to build a school called the osama bin laden academy , warned the general secretary of the association of teachers and lecturers -lrb- atl -rrb- , peter smith .
similarly the church of scientology , the moonies or even supporters of david icke - the former footballer and tv presenter who once claimed he was the messiah - could apply to run a state school , said mr smith .
since the attacks of 11 september , race riots in the north of england last summer and tension surrounding a roman catholic school in belfast , government plans to encourage a wide range of religious groups to run state-funded schools have proved controversial , with critics saying they are divisive .
mixed opinion over faith schools was no less obvious than at the atl 's annual conference in cardiff , where delegates tabled conflicting motions on the matter .
one calls for the government to abandon all plans to increase the number of faith schools , another urges delegates to " recognise the positive contribution these faith schools make to the education of young people " .

faith schools must give pupils a full and equal access to the national curriculum , he said .

the classic greats tend to be more classic and certainly greater .

demis roussos , naturally .
what do you think of the new british bands coming through at the moment ?

do you think your music is as relevant to fans now as it was when you first started out ?

so yes , of course .
do you visit any music websites regularly ?
nope .
i tend to go to the movie quiz sites and pit my nogin against other sad anoraks .

what do you think of the new british bands coming through at the moment ?
like who ?
i thought we 're still coming through .
which current artists do you think are likely to be legends in 20 years time ?
dj otzi is here to stay - he is a god .
who inspires your dress sense ?
all sorts of individuals really , but mainly odd background characters from movies .
john malkovich in rounders , for instance , pulled off a rather fetching tracksuit top and lumberjack look .
what song always makes you cry ?
till i die by the beach boys always makes me glaze over .
do you have trouble in continuing to find the inspiration to make music ?
no .
not yet .
do you think your music is as relevant to fans now as it was when you first started out ?
it seems to still generate positive emotional outbursts from the people who come to the shows .
so yes , of course .
do you visit any music websites regularly ?
nope .
i tend to go to the movie quiz sites and pit my nogin against other sad anoraks .

a comprehensive seven-month audit found that 92 % of the 5,000 wireless networks in the capital had not taken basic steps to protect themselves against casual attacks .
the survey , sponsored by the international chamber of commerce , used some novel software tools that could detect the networks other systems missed .
many of the networks readily handed out internet connections to anyone that connected to them and almost all passed around confidential information in an easy to interpret form .
site seizing the survey shows just how popular wireless networks have become in only a few short years , and the risks companies are taking with sensitive information .
" it 's the old story where you have convenience that has taken over prudence , " said pottengal mukundan , director of the icc 's crime-fighting division .
with a converted can of pringles wireless hacking is easier previous audits of the wireless networks in london have tended to concentrate on one area , such as docklands or the city , and the networks found have numbered in the tens rather than hundreds .
but simon gunning , of technology security firm digilog , has found that the capital is home to more than 5,000 wireless networks that are being used in offices , government buildings , prisons , police stations and even at the palace of westminster .
" i really did n't expect to find so many , " he said .
he found them thanks to a software tool , freely available on the internet , which can spot wireless network access points that try to hide by turning off their ability to broadcast their presence .
mr gunning carried out the survey by driving around london in a car carrying a laptop fitted with the network-spotting software .
networks exposed although wireless networks do have some basic built-in security features , the vast majority of networks found during this latest survey had not turned them on .
even the few that had turned on the basic encryption system were using default settings , making it easy for an attacker to guess the key needed to unscramble data .
as a result , anyone gathering up packets of data from these networks would be able to read the text within them easily , said mr gunning .
those not interested in stealing data could piggyback on the fast net connection linked to the wireless network .
now , " war-driving " , as it has become known , is a popular pastime with many curious computer enthusiasts .
mr gunning said many people were experimenting with long-range antennae that allow them to pick up signals from many kilometres away .
security company i-sec has shown how an antenna made from an old can of pringles crisps can help pinpoint networks .

projects on hold visit of north korean leader to south reunions of divided families reopening of rail and road links closer economic ties south korea is hoping the visit will help to reduce tensions on the divided peninsula after a four-month break in contacts .
lim dong-won , a special advisor on national security to president kim dae-jung , will travel to pyongyang on 3 april .
he will stay for about four days , a senior government official said .
south korea 's president kim has said talks between the two koreas was " essential " , not just for the countries themselves but also for improving us and japanese relations with the communist north .
missive south korean news agency yonhap reported that mr lim will be carrying a letter from president kim dae-jung urging pyongyang to resolve nuclear and missile development issues and resume dialogue with washington .
but the south korean president 's chief spokeswoman , park son-sook , played down hopes of a breakthrough .
" i understand that expectations and interest are huge because of the stalemate in north-south ties and the atmosphere of tension this year , but now is a time to monitor calmly the outcome of the pyongyang mission , " she said .
north korea broke off dialogue with the south last year , in response to what it saw as hostility from the united states towards pyongyang .
us president george w bush has said that north korea is part of an " axis of evil " , accusing it of trying to develop weapons of mass destruction .
in further moves to kick-start inter-korean dialogue , south korean foreign minister choi sung-hong will visit beijing on thursday to discuss the troubled peninsula with his chinese counterpart and ask for beijing 's support in easing tensions , the south korean foreign ministry said .
talks agenda spokeswoman ms park has said the presidential envoy 's visit to the north is at south korea 's request " for an exchange of broad opinions " .
" we expect the talks to lay the groundwork for a resumption of stalled relations between south and north korea , " she said .
it is believed that talks might also cover reunions between members of families divided since the 1950-53 korean war .
but no mention has been made of the recent defection of 25 north koreans to the south through china - and the ensuing crackdown on refugees on the border between china and north korea .
tense relations relations between the two koreas reached a peak in june 2000 with a historic summit between president kim and north korean leader kim jong-il .

relations between the two koreas cooled after us president george w bush took office and expressed scepticism about the north korean leader .
in january , relations worsened again when mr bush said north korea was part of " an axis of evil " along with iran and iraq .

egypt 's al-akhbar sums up the arab public 's expectations of the summit .
" the arab street is expecting the arab leaders to adopt effective stances which rise up to the challenges and impose our rights , " the paper says . "
the summit is capable of confronting israel and forcing it to accept the arab peace initiative , whether it likes or not " uae 's al-khali the independent united arab emirates paper al-khalij makes a similar point .
" the forthcoming arab summit is capable of confronting israel and forcing it to accept the arab peace initiative , whether it likes or not , " it says .
the egyptian pro-government daily al-gomhuria believes the clear message from the summit should be that " just and balanced peace in the middle east is in the interest of all regional and international parties " .
' political card ' the papers dismiss israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's proposal that he attend the beirut arab summit to present israel 's position .
the independent palestinian paper al-quds believes " the issue ... is being used as political card by israel to force the palestinians to make concessions . "
" sharon is doing is nothing more than making a desperate attempt to get out of the dangerous crisis into which the intifada has dragged him , " says the uae 's pro-government al-ittihad .
the palestinian al-hayat al-jadidah charges that mr sharon " wants to take the palestinian seat " in the summit , since israel has not indicated whether it will allow yasser arafat out of his west bank headquarters to attend the summit . "
" beirut has not forgotten ariel sharon 's 1982 visit " al-sharq al-awsat the london-based al-sharq al-awsat alleges that mr sharon wants " to rehabilitate himself politically within and outside israel " as it recalls the crisis of the 1980s .
" beirut has not forgotten his 1982 visit , or the massacres of the palestinians in sabra and shatila " the paper says in reference to israel 's invasion of lebanon under mr sharon 's command .
and saudi arabia 's al-watan asserts : " sharon is not welcome in beirut or in any other arab capital , even if there is peace between the arabs and the zionist state . "
' last defence ' in yemen , the pro-government paper al-thawrah warns arabs against trying to " bring an end to the palestinian intifada " .
" will the arabs realise that the intifada is their last defence against the tyranny of that enemy who is hunting for opportunities to devour them one by one ? " the paper asks .
the london-based pan-arab al-hayat sounds a similar note .
" obviously everyone will attend the beirut summit , except the palestinian intifada .
the summit 's final draft ... does not even refer to it as if it does not exist . "
according to the palestinian al-ayyam , " the only way of solving the current crisis is to reinforce elected president arafat 's credibility . "
syrian newspaper al-ba 'th , charges that " the aims behind most of the recent international moves , particularly the us ones , are not the establishment of peace on the basis of international resolutions but to rescue sharon " .
iraq and there is widespread rejection of attacks on iraq in the us-led anti-terror campaign . "
arab leaders have to say clearly that they are against any strike on iraq " al-dastur babil , owned by saddam hussein 's son , declares that " the iraqis have pledged to fight american aggression and to continue their support for the intifadah . "
libya al-shams writes of " hostile " statements by western governments which " unfortunately shows the falsehood of this west 's claims of civilisation and humanity " .
for jordan 's independent daily al-dustur , the point is quite clear .
" the arab leaders have to say clearly that they are against any strike on iraq , " it says .
but in kuwait , the independent al-qabas holds a different view : " we do not agree ... that dialogue with saddam hussein 's iraq will lead to security and stability , " the paper says .

up to 750 naval support workers across the uk could lose their jobs in the changes which will see a further 3,000 staff transferred to the private sector .
armed forces minister adam ingram said the changes were necessary to modernise the service and would save taxpayers more than £ 300m over the next five years .
the changes will take effect at the scottish bases at coulport and faslane - home of the trident nuclear submarine fleet - and at portsmouth and devonport . "
our members feel utterly betrayed " jack dromey transport and general workers ' union however , the minister said the majority of job losses were likely to occur at the two clyde bases .
he stressed that the figure of 750 job losses was a worst case scenario and it would be up to the naval dockyard companies who have been awarded the " partnering " contracts for the work to decide .
speaking on bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme , mr ingram said : " i think we really have to strip away the rhetoric and look at the reality here that there will be a substantial number of jobs remaining within the public sector .
' maximum efficiency " so we 're not inventing the wheel , this is not a leap in the dark , this is about trying to ensure maximum efficiency .
" around 1,100 will be retained at the clyde in the public sector , so i think there is a bit of serious misinformation going on in all this . "
the efficiency drive would generate significant savings that would be used in the " front line " of defence , the minister said .
mr ingram said the status quo could not prevail as there was too many people employed with a reduced workload .
however , union leaders have accused the government of betrayal .
they are meeting in london on tuesday to consider a co-ordinated response to the proposals but have already indicated that strike action is on the cards .
jack dromey , national organiser at the transport and general workers ' union , said : " our members feel utterly betrayed .
' no guarantees ' " we are not going to accept compulsory redundancies .
" if ministers say to our members ' thanks for your past loyalty , here 's a redundancy notice , here 's privatisation and no guarantees about job cuts , pay cuts , conditions of employment , no guarantees against compulsory redundancies ' , then industrial action is inevitable . "
union spokesman derek torrie , chairman of the trade unions at faslane , said : " we are now on a collision course with the government .
" we will continue to resist these privatisation plans and will fight on . "
mr ingram announced that " partnering " contracts would be put in place with babcock naval services at clyde , fleet support at portsmouth and devonport management .
john howie , babcock naval services managing director , said : " in securing this opportunity we have successfully demonstrated our ability to manage critical services on a nuclear-authorised site while also delivering substantial reductions in the cost of providing these services . "
babcock has been running the rosyth dockyard in fife for nearly 15 years .
mr howie said : " we have plenty of experience in this field .
we have made positive changes for employees at rosyth in terms of pay conditions and empowerment .
" the only way we will succeed is by having a capable and motivated workforce . "
the first sea lord , admiral sir nigel essenhigh , said plans would not compromise security and the royal navy commodores at the three bases would remain in overall control .

it upheld a federal judge 's ruling that ordered the company to keep its free service offline until it can fully comply with an injunction to remove all copyright music .
us district judge marilyn hall patel ordered the shutdown in july after napster argued that it could block more than 99 % of all infringing song files .
but ms patel told napster it needed to block 100 % of unauthorised copyright songs or stay offline indefinitely .
since the ruling napster has been focusing on creating a paid online music service .
since 1999 , recording companies have been seeking damages from napster for allowing copyrighted songs by recording artists to be swapped by users who were able to swap and download recorded material for free .
companies including aol time warner , emi and bertelsmann allege such software was cheating them out of royalties .
last month , ms patel handed napster a small victory , giving the service time to gather evidence over the copyright infringement case .
bertlesmann has since joined forces with napster and hopes to relaunch the site legally later this year .
popular created by then 19-year-old student shawn fanning -lrb- napster was his nickname at university -rrb- , the service at one point swelled to more than 70 million users .
napster counters that music labels deliberately misused their copyrights in order to dominate the relatively unchartered world of online music distribution .
it says they wanted to see napster shut down purely so their own sites would face no other competition .
in an effort to join the mainstream , napster began testing a paid , secure online music service in january .
it has yet to secure any licences from the major labels who sued it for copyright infringement .

it upheld a federal judge 's ruling that ordered the company to keep its free service offline until it can fully comply with an injunction to remove all copyright music .
us district judge marilyn hall patel ordered the shutdown in july after napster argued that it could block more than 99 % of all infringing song files .
shawn fanning started the service as a 19-year-old but ms patel told napster it needed to block 100 % of unauthorised copyright songs or stay offline indefinitely .
since the ruling napster has been focusing on creating a paid online music service .
since 1999 , recording companies have been seeking damages from napster for allowing copyrighted songs by recording artists to be swapped by users who were able to swap and download recorded material for free .
companies including aol time warner , emi and bertelsmann allege such software was cheating them out of royalties .
last month , ms patel handed napster a small victory , giving the service time to gather evidence over the copyright infringement case .
bertlesmann has since joined forces with napster and hopes to relaunch the site legally later this year .
popular created by then 19-year-old student shawn fanning -lrb- napster was his nickname at university -rrb- , the service at one point swelled to more than 70 million users .
napster counters that music labels deliberately misused their copyrights in order to dominate the relatively unchartered world of online music distribution .
it says they wanted to see napster shut down purely so their own sites would face no other competition .
in an effort to join the mainstream , napster began testing a paid , secure online music service in january .
it has yet to secure any licences from the major labels who sued it for copyright infringement .

it 's all thanks to the global popularity of surfing .
fittingly for a nation practised in mixing business with pleasure , surfing is not only the national pastime , it 's also one of the country 's most lucrative exports .
behind the surf , sea and sand - a $ 10bn a year business that 's grown from the love of the great ozzie outdoors , according to billabong chief executive matthew perrin .
dominating the us surf scene " the three major brands - ourselves , quiksilver and rip curl all started in australia .
i think australia in the late 60s , early 70s undoubtably had the strongest surf culture , the best surfers in the world at that time .
" so the brands that started here arguably had the the best image etc and that was easily exportable to overseas markets . "
surfing is a $ 10bn a year business from humble beginnings in some of australia 's best known surfing towns , three brands have risen to global dominance .
quiksilver , the now us-owned sector leader , makes two thirds of its $ 600m a year sales in the united states .
billabong comes second with annual sales of $ 200m .
and rip curl is third , with total sales of about $ 100m a year .
conquering the key north american market is everyone 's strategy .
quiksilver is dominant already .
surfing beyond the seas most analysts agree that billabong and rip curl have several years to go before they reach maturity in the us .
while other retail stocks have been getting hit over the past six months , surf stocks have been surging .
the industry 's still growing at 10-12 % globally phil zammit that 's because the core buyers of surfwear , the 12-24 year olds , have traditionally defied the recession driven slowdown in discretionary spending that affects their parents .
but for all the big firms the pressure to innovate and keep the youth market hooked is unrelenting .
surf brands are having to diversify into ski and skate wear to provide a firm all year round sales base .
alongside the boardshorts and t-shirts .
you 'll now find watches , sunglasses and even skateboards .
in fact , almost anything the core teen market desires .
surfing the big growth wave in a sector defined by youth , retail analysts like macquarie equities ' phil zammit believe maturity is still some way off .
" the industry 's still growing at 10-12 % globally .
we think kids are only just starting to appreciate product ranges coming out of these companies and also start tapping into new areas like back to school and so forth .
surf brands also sell skate boards " the new markets , footwear , sunglasses are all starting to roll out new product lines .
so there is still a lot of growth to come . "
the action sportswear market , of which surfwear is a key part , will grow an estimated 30 % this year - compare that with just 1 % growth for the retail sector as a whole .
making money given those figures , it 's no surprise that the likes of billabong and globe have been stockmarket darlings .
in just 18 months as a public company , billabong 's share price has grown from 2.30 australian dollars to more than au $ 9 .
that performance is pulling some of the other players towards flotations of their own .
rip curl recently appointed former qantas airways chief executive james strong as chairman with a brief to take rip curl to investors .
globally the surfwear business generates margins of about 30 % for the key players .

fiat is hoping to sell 20,000 of the vehicles in china this year , and 50,000 in 2003 .
despite its huge population , china only has five million cars on the road - 750,000 of which were registered last year .
manufacturers are increasingly keen to tap into a potential market of more than 1.3 billion people , many of whom are growing increasingly wealthy .
on-going expansion fiat 's uk chief executive , richard gadeselli , told the bbc 's world business report that the cars would be produced in nanjing in a joint venture with yeujin motor group .
the plant will be located near an iveco truck plant which fiat opened in the mid-80s .
mr gadeselli emphasised that the models produced in china would not be exactly the same as those manufactured in italy .
" the common factor in these developing markets is that the road infrastructure is n't as well produced as it is in a mature market such as north america , japan or europe , " he said .
this means that the suspension systems need to be more rugged .
the palio project is part of a concerted push by fiat to develop increase its sales in emerging markets .
the palio was first launched in 1996 in brazil , followed by argentina .
" we have -lrb- since -rrb- opened production hubs in turkey , poland , egypt , south africa , india , vietnam , china - and the next one will be russia , " said mr gadeselli .

"
it is a serious development and we will have to counter it " omer farooq senior separatist leader police in srinagar , the capital of indian-administered kashmir , used tear gas on tuesday for the second day running to disperse violent protests against his arrest .
mr malik , who heads the separatist jammu kashmir liberation front -lrb- jklf -rrb- , was seized by police on monday while he was addressing a press conference .
the police say he was arrested after a man and a woman allegedly smuggled $ 100,000 into kashmir from pakistan which was intended for him .
the remand order came as india 's parliament convened a rare joint session to debate the new terrorism law , which critics say is draconian and oppressive .
burning barricades the judge who handed down the remand order has also asked medical authorities to form a team of doctors to monitor mr malik , who has a heart condition .
dozens of young activists took the streets near mr malik 's srinagar residence , setting up burning barricades and throwing stones at security forces .
the arrest was condemned by kashmir 's main separatist alliance , the all party hurriyat conference , of which mr malik is also an executive member .
according to the afp news agency , senior hurriyat leader omer farooq described his detention as a " gross misuse of power and politically motivated " .
" it is a serious development and we will have to counter it , " mr farooq was quoted as saying .
mr malik is being held under the prevention of terrorism ordinance -lrb- poto -rrb- bill , which the indian government is trying to pass formally into law .
the joint session in delhi debating the law is only the third of its kind since india gained independence in 1947 .
but opposition parties fear the increased powers will be misused by the security forces , and have described the measures as draconian .
they lay down provisions for curbing funding for suspected terrorists , confiscating their property and allowing for the detention of suspects for up to 90 days without trial .
' smuggled cash ' on sunday , police arrested a kashmiri militant , mushtaq ahmed dar , and a kashmiri girl during a random police check on the main highway leading to srinagar , and found them to be carrying $ 100,000 .
the girl reportedly told police that the money had been handed over to them in the nepalese capital , kathmandu , by a pakistan-based kashmiri separatist , and was to be delivered to mr malik .
police have now charged the two people under a special anti-terrorist law .
but mr malik denied the allegations .
he told journalists before his arrest that he would quit the separatist movement if it was proved that the money was being sent to him from pakistan-administered kashmir .
mr malik 's jklf is one of the oldest separatist organisations and favours the independence of kashmir from both india and pakistan .
the jklf declared a unilateral ceasefire in 1994 and since then has concentrated on pushing their cause politically .

the proposed facility , which will cost up to £ 150m , would be built 10km off the shore of abergele , near colwyn bay .
the plan by celtic offshore wind limited -lrb- cowl -rrb- consists of 30 wind turbines at rhyl flats , seven miles out at sea from abergele .
the wind farm would produce enough power to meet the domestic needs of more than 105,000 households - 75 % of all the domestic needs of conwy , flintshire and denbighshire .
cowl submitted their plans to the uk and welsh assembly governments for approval on tuesday .
if given the go ahead , developers will begin work on the site in april 2004 and should be finished within five months .
another project proposed by national wind power involves 30 turbines at north hoyle , five miles out from prestatyn .
renewable energy and a third separate off-shore windfarm is planned for scarweather sands , off port talbot , south wales .
uk energy minister brian wilson has publicly supported wind power development in wales .
by 2010 the uk government hopes to have at least 10 % of its electricity produced by renewable energy .
national wind power claims 6,000 customers in north wales have signed up to receive their " green " energy from hoyle through its juice scheme .
the firm hopes the hoyle plan could be up and running by the winter of 2003 and eventually supply 50,000 customers .
the rival rhyl flats development would mean a significant investment in north wales for local business consortium cowl .
the group consists of first hydro renewables and the renewable development company .
first hydro director charles williams said the scheme could mean extra employment in the region .
" the cowl consortium has a policy wherever possible to procure the services and skills of local organisations and contractors , " he said .

women who are positive for the sti human papillomavirus -lrb- hpv -rrb- could be at up to three times greater risk of developing cancer if they have used the pill for five years or longer .
a four-fold increased risk was found for hpv-positive women who had taken the pill for more than 10 years .
but there is no evidence that long-term pill use increases the risk of cervical cancer in women who do not have hpv .
the virus is the main cause of cervical cancer , which killed around 1,250 uk women in 2000 .
an international panel of experts has looked at pill use and hpv infection rates .
in a paper published by the lancet , they conclude long-term use of the pill could be a contributory risk factor to developing cervical cancer in women with hpv .
this is certainly a very interesting study , but they have not actually proved that the pill causes cervical cancer dr anne szarewski , cancer research uk but uk experts stressed that women taking the pill should not be overly worried by the research .
they said the researchers had not proved that the pill causes cervical cancer .
and they said regular cervical screening would pick up signs of the disease early .
' step in the process ' data for almost 1,900 women from studies carried out carried out in thailand , the philippines , morocco , brazil , peru , paraguay , columbia and spain was examined by scientists from the international agency for research on cancer .
the risk of cervical cancer ranges from 1 % in developed countries to 5 % in developing countries .
silvia franceschi who led the study : " we think that our results lend support to the existence of an association between oral contraceptives and hpv .
" they could help women who have persistent hpv infection to balance the benefits -lrb- prevention of pregnancy and cancers of the ovary and uterus -rrb- and harms of long-term oral contraceptive use , and suggest that long-term users of oral contraceptives should be included in cervical screening programmes . "
in a separate study , the iarc also found high numbers of pregnancies increases the risk of cervical cancer amongst hpv-positive women .
david skegg from the university of otago , new zealand , writing in a commentary in the lancet , added : " any causal relation between long-term oral contraception and cervical cancer would be most important in the developing world , where cervical cancer is common and few women have access to high-quality cytological screening .
" from a public-health viewpoint , a key question is the extent to which effects persist after women stop taking oral contraceptives .
" for nearly two decades , concerns about oral contraceptives and neoplasia were focused mainly on breast cancer-with the eventual outcome being reassuring .
ironically the relation with cervical cancer may turn out to be more important . "
he backed world health organization commissioned work to evaluate all the relevant data .
' no proof ' commenting on the findings looking at use of the pill , hpv and cervical cancer , a spokeswoman for the family planning association said : " the overall likelihood of getting cervical cancer in the uk is low whether you use the pill for a long time of not . "
dr anne szarewski , clinical consultant for cancer research uk , told bbc news online : " this is certainly a very interesting study , but they have not actually proved that the pill causes cervical cancer .
" they have just shown that if you are hpv positive and take the pill , you are at greater risk . "
dr szarewski said the most important thing for women in the uk to remember was that cervical screening would pick up any problems .
she added that women should not be deterred from taking the pill : " you have to balance this possible risk from the pill against many known benefits , such as protection against ovarian and endometrial cancer . "
women can reduce their risk of contracting hpv and other stis by also using barrier methods of contraception .

david skegg from the university of otago , new zealand , writing in a commentary in the lancet , added : " any causal relation between long-term oral contraception and cervical cancer would be most important in the developing world , where cervical cancer is common and few women have access to high-quality cytological screening .
" from a public-health viewpoint , a key question is the extent to which effects persist after women stop taking oral contraceptives .
" for nearly two decades , concerns about oral contraceptives and neoplasia were focused mainly on breast cancer-with the eventual outcome being reassuring .
ironically the relation with cervical cancer may turn out to be more important . "
he backed world health organization commissioned work to evaluate all the relevant data .
' no proof ' commenting on the findings looking at use of the pill , hpv and cervical cancer , a spokeswoman for the family planning association said : " the overall likelihood of getting cervical cancer in the uk is low whether you use the pill for a long time of not . "
dr anne szarewski , clinical consultant for cancer research uk , told bbc news online : " this is certainly a very interesting study , but they have not actually proved that the pill causes cervical cancer .
" they have just shown that if you are hpv positive and take the pill , you are at greater risk . "
dr szarewski said the most important thing for women in the uk to remember was that cervical screening would pick up any problems .
she added that women should not be deterred from taking the pill : " you have to balance this possible risk from the pill against many known benefits , such as protection against ovarian and endometrial cancer . "
women can reduce their risk of contracting hpv and other stis by also using barrier methods of contraception .

" although it is painful to part with my world cup winner 's medal i believe it is for the best and i hope my medal finds a worthy home .

the controversial filmmaker visited mr arafat 's office in the west bank city of ramallah .
stone said he had already interviewed " a series of israeli leaders " and hinted that prime minister ariel sharon was among them .
i 'm not a newsman , i 'm not investigating , i 'm not looking for scoops that will beat everyone oliver stone the filming follows a documentary he recently made on cuba and its president , fidel castro .
stone said his motivation behind the trip to the middle east was to find what makes a world leader tick .
he said : " there 's always a similarity in world conflicts everywhere you go .
" what is the common denominator ?
maybe pride , maybe human ego , maybe the sense of humiliation , all these factors .
heath ledger is set to star in stone 's new movie " these characters that you meet , mr arafat and mr sharon , whoever it is , they remind you what life is about , what leaders are about , what power is about . "
more than 1,500 people have been killed since the start of the current palestinian uprising , which erupted in september 2000 .

"
-lsb- the launch -rsb- showed the chinese people 's spirit of constantly striving to become stronger " president jiang zemin the shenzhou iii craft , with dummy astronauts on board , was launched atop a long march 2f rocket from the jiuquan space launch centre in gansu province on monday .
reports say the space vehicle entered its pre-set orbit shortly after blast-off at 2215 beijing time -lrb- 1415 gmt -rrb- .
the craft , which is said to consist of an orbital module , re-entry module , propulsion section and access section , will orbit the earth once every 90 minutes and will remain in space for " a couple of days " , china daily said .
animal tests " the successful launches of three shenzhou spaceships take the country to new heights of space science and technology , " chinese president jiang zemin was quoted as saying after witnessing the launch at jiuquan .
the launch " showed the chinese people 's spirit of constantly striving to become stronger , " he said .
china is aiming to become the third nation to put a human in space after the united states and the former soviet union .
the first test flight of the shenzhou -lrb- divine vessel -rrb- programme was in november 1999 , when a capsule orbited the earth 14 times in a 12-hour mission aimed at testing launch and re-entry systems .
shenzhou ii , launched in january 2001 , circled the earth 108 times and tested life support systems - it put a monkey , a dog , a rabbit and snails into orbit .
it returned nearly a week later to a press blackout that left western analysts suspecting a re-entry failure .
the chinese authorities denied this .
future goals the xinhua news agency said chinese scientists had designed life sciences , materials , astronomy and physics experiments to be performed during the latest flight .
shenzhou iii 's simulated astronauts were equipped with a system to test the human body 's responses to conditions in outer space , china daily said .
technicians on the ground could control the dummy to monitor a real astronaut 's would-be heartbeat , pulse , breathing , nutritional needs - and even waste disposal - while in orbit , the paper added .
chen yan , an independent space expert who monitors the chinese space programme on his go taikonauts website , said : " if the shenzhou iii does not encounter any problems , then china could put a man in space as early as next year . "
a corps of astronauts - dubbed taikonauts , from the chinese word for outer space - have been training for some time .
space officials have said that a goal of china 's space programme is to put a chinese astronaut on the moon one day .

kiyomi tsujimoto , a leading member of the tiny opposition social democratic party , was forced to give up her seat in parliament after revelations of financial wrongdoing in her own office .
it is the latest in a series of scandals that have further damaged an increasingly discredited political system and disheartened an already apathetic electorate .
surveys published in local media on tuesday showed falling support for prime minister 's junichiro koizumi 's cabinet and less than half the people asked admitting to support any political party .
a new image the bbc 's correspondent in tokyo , charles scanlon , says that with her raucous osaka accent and blunt accusations , miss tsujimoto , 41 , was fast emerging as a dynamic new force in japanese politics .
recent scandals have affected koizumi 's popularity the social activist-turned-politician stood out among the ranks of ageing men in dark suits .
in recent weeks had been delighting television audiences with fierce attacks on discredited ruling party politicians .
she openly accused one influential power-broker of lying as he was forced out for helping his friends to juicy construction contracts .

money diverted she initially denied the charge but later admitted that she had used most of a 10m yen -lrb- $ 74,990 -rrb- annual salary paid by the government to her policy aide to cover office expenses , including salaries for other staff .
while doing so is not necessarily illegal , mrs tsujimoto could have broken the law by failing to report the move .
our correspondent says there is much speculation that the old guard has struck back at one of its most prominent tormentors , sending a signal that they can not be attacked with impunity .
but he says there is now little sympathy for miss tsujimoto , who traded on her reputation as one of a new breed of politician with an unimpeachable past .
her own interrogations had led to the resignation of two other lawmakers in the last two weeks .
koichi kato and muneo suzuki both left the ruling party on corruption allegations .
public disaffection this has apparently further eroded public backing for japan 's once-revered prime minister , junichiro koizumi .
support for mr koizumi 's cabinet fell 2.4 percentage points from february to 50.6 % , according to a survey by the japanese daily ' yomiuri shimbun . '
but japan 's recent scandals appear to have worsened the public 's mistrust of politics in general .
the number of people who supported no party at all rose two percentage points from february to 50.7 % , the paper said .
" the public is being driven to despair , thinking that politicians are the same whether they belong to the ruling parties or opposition , " said mineaki yamamoto , a political commentator .

father joseph jones told irish radio that senior army officers were to blame .
father declan o 'toole , his driver and another companion were killed last thursday evening .
father jones said his late colleague had been assaulted by officers a fortnight ago after asking the army to be less aggressive in their campaign to disarm local residents .
" if the army was involved , then they are the ones that should be punished and not those poor fellows who were executed yesterday , because if they did fire the shots , they were only acting on orders from senior officers , " said father jones from the st joseph 's society for foreign missions .

" then about 10 updf -lrb- ugandan people 's defence forces -rrb- soldiers putting on masks were brought and ordered to lie down and start firing .
they fired their weapons continuously for about two minutes before a doctor was told to check whether the two were dead , he said .
" the doctor found that one was still breathing , so he was shot at close range by a senior officer in the head using a pistol , " said our correspondent .
the crowd of about 1,000 people who witnessed the execution mostly felt the soldiers deserved the punishment because the priest was a well-respected member of the community .
the army wanted to act quickly following the priest 's murder in case local anger disrupted the government 's policy of disarming people in the volatile karamoja region , said nathan etengu .
president museveni launched the campaign last december to try to persuade karamajong cattle-keepers to hand over 40,000 weapons they are estimated to possess .

while business leaders and leisure bosses in blackpool are eager to embrace plans for casino hotels and £ 1m bandit machine jackpots , religious and anti-gambling organisations are urging caution .
peter moore , chairman of the blackpool regeneration working group and former managing director of leisure group center parcs , says gambling deregulation is great news for the town .

las vegas has hundreds of hotel casinos culture secretary tessa jowell has revealed proposals allowing giant casino complexes and lavish ammusement arcades all over the country .
laws last changed in 1967 during a clampdown on casinos infiltrated by organised crime have been relaxed to allow easier advertising and membership .
lancashire entertainment firm leisure parcs already has plans for its own five-star hotel casinos .
mr moore said : " it is great news for blackpool as part of its aspirations to become the country 's premier destination resort .
" las vegas-style casino hotels are a powerful catalyst for regeneration and bring a number of undoubted benefits .
" this is a significant time for this famous resort and heralds a new era for blackpool .
this quantum leap in gambling opportunity will inevitably bring in people who will become casualties , lose a lot of money and end up on the streets the reverend michael fielding , blackpool coalition against gaming expansion " comfortable , modern , well-equipped accommodation , exciting entertainment , shopping and food experiences , accessed through visually appealing , pleasurable , weather-proofed , street environments with landscaped squares .

" this quantum leap in gambling opportunity will inevitably bring in people who will become casualties , lose a lot of money , and end up on the streets . "
ms jowell has announced the formation of a gambling commission to oversee the revamped gaming industry .
mr fielding said : " the plans will bring people into blackpool to visit casinos , but they will stay there .
the doors will not be locked but there will be every conceivable attraction to keep them in .
more gambling " there will be theatres , creches , restaurants and bars , they will win and lose the money within the walls of the casino .
" the government is determined to implement this .
" big business will reap the benefits , but there are four casinos in blackpool already and no-one has demonstrated there is a demand for more gambling .
" blackpool has to regain the heart it had when it was a true family resort . "
