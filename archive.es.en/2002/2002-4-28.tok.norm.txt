the violence then spread to the regional capital , ambon city , where a bomb went off , and a centre for christian and muslim children and one of the city 's main churches were set on fire .
it is the most serious outbreak of violence in the moluccas since a peace deal was signed by christian and muslim leaders in february 2002 .
the deal was intended to put an end to three years of sectarian violence in which more than 6,000 people have died .
homes set alight the violence began early on sunday in the village of soya .
" they attacked the village by using home-made bombs and set fire to some of the houses , " a local journalist said .
there are reports that some 30 homes and a church were set on fire .
six people are reported to have been stabbed to death , and a further six are said to have died in the fires .
christian sources say the soya attack was carried out by a muslim mob armed with machetes , knives and bombs .
two of the attackers also died in the fighting .
many of the villagers , particularly the women and children , have now fled the area .
ambon police chief brigadier-general sunarko danu artanto confirmed the attack , but gave no further details .
independence the violence comes after the christian separatist south moluccas republic -lrb- rms -rrb- group raised flags in ambon on thursday , the 52nd anniversary of a failed independence bid .
angry muslim crowds took to the streets in response , and the leader of the extremist islamic organisation , laskar jihad , called on all muslims in the moluccan islands to launch a renewed war against the christian community .
the group 's commander , jafar umar thalib , told thousands attending a rally after friday prayers that the peace agreement should be ignored .
bbc jakarta correspondent richard galpin says the critical issue now is whether the authorities can prevent the violence from spreading - which would mean clamping down on the activities of laskar jihad , which so far the government has been afraid to do .
muslims make up 85 % of indonesia 's 210 million people , but in the moluccas half the population is christian .

the israeli government has already delayed the team 's arrival twice with objections about its make-up and mandate .
the un team , due to come to israel on sunday , is waiting in geneva for permission to depart .
israeli foreign minister shimon peres said the main stumbling block delaying the start of the mission was what access the united nations would be given to israeli soldiers who took part in the west bank military offensive .
" israel can not accept the demand by the united nations mission to decide which military people it will question , " he said .
a bbc correspondent says that some hard talking is expected at the meeting , with right-wingers highly suspicious of the united nations .
israeli government spokesman arie mekel on saturday acknowledged that " some progress " had been made in talks in new york over the terms and composition of the team but stopped short of saying israel accepted the mission .
the palestinians claim a massacre of hundreds of people resulted from the 29 march israeli incursion , while israel acknowledges only dozens of casualties .
manhunt a large israeli military operation is under way to try to find the palestinian gunmen who entered a jewish settlement near the west bank town of hebron on saturday , killing four residents , including a five-year-old girl .
israeli officials say three palestinians , disguised as israeli soldiers , cut through the wire fence surrounding the adora settlement and shot anyone they came across , before escaping .
israeli troops say they killed one of the gunmen during a raid on a nearby arab village .
a bbc jerusalem correspondent says the attack on the settlement was the most serious since israel began its recent military offensive in the west bank .
early on sunday , a man opened fire in central jerusalem , wounding two people , before being arrested by police .
but a police spokesman said that the matter was a personal dispute , and " not a terrorist attack " .
bethlehem talks israeli and palestinian officials are also expected to resume talks to try to resolve the stand-off involving palestinians holed-up inside the church of the nativity in bethlehem .
nine youths were released from the church on thursday , along with the bodies of two palestinians killed in fighting with the israelis .
but about 30 men remain inside .
israel has been reported as offering them the option of trial here or exile overseas .
in the most recent development , the islamic militant group hezbollah offered to exchange captured israeli soldiers to secure the release of the palestinians .
in a statement broadcast on a lebanese television station , the hezbollah leader , sheikh hassan nasrallah , said it was willing to negotiate the exchange of four israelis , held since 2000 , through any intermediary .
the statement said hezbollah also wanted released four more who are in palestinian custody in ramallah in connection with last year 's killing of the israeli tourism minister , rehavam zeevi .

the software giant is one of several firms trying to assemble a consortium to take over the wreckage , according to the observer newspaper .
the loss-making network , locked into a cripplingly expensive broadcast deal with the football league , went into administration last month after failing to negotiate lower transmission fees .
a microsoft spokeswoman refused to comment on the speculation .
but it is known that microsoft is eager to enter the interactive television market , having already taken stakes in uk cable firms , ntl and telewest .
speculation about buyers culture secretary tessa jowell hinted on friday that " new players " could save the broadcaster from being liquidated .
deloitte & touche , the administrators for itv digital , have enough money to keep the company going until early next week .
that has ensured that the coverage of the football league play-offs is going ahead as planned over the weekend .
if a buyer for the company does not come forward in the next few days , itv digital is likely to be broken up and its assets sold off piecemeal .
speculation about potential buyers has previously centered on european media giants such as vivendi or bertelesmann or on venture capitalist groups .
deloitte & touche are already offering the company 's assets for sale but say they are still hopeful of finding a buyer for the business as a going concern .
meetings will take place on monday and tuesday with an announcement to come as early as wednesday .
merger talks reopen the situation could spell financial disaster for dozens of uk football clubs in england 's first , second and third divisions , due for a slice of tv rights money .
the football league , which oversees the divisions , is owed £ 178.5m by itv digital in tv rights .
the league has pledged to sue itv digital 's owners , media firms granada and carlton , for the money , but there are fears some clubs could go under before any case was settled .
meanwhile other sunday press reports suggest that granada and carlton will reopen talks for a £ 5bn merger in order to placate shareholders for the money lost on itv digital .

the loss-making network , locked into a cripplingly expensive broadcast deal with the football league , went into administration last month after failing to negotiate lower transmission fees .
a microsoft spokeswoman refused to comment on the speculation .
but it is known that microsoft is eager to enter the interactive television market , having already taken stakes in uk cable firms , ntl and telewest .
speculation about buyers culture secretary tessa jowell hinted on friday that " new players " could save the broadcaster from being liquidated .
deloitte & touche , the administrators for itv digital , have enough money to keep the company going until early next week .
that has ensured that the coverage of the football league play-offs is going ahead as planned over the weekend .
if a buyer for the company does not come forward in the next few days , itv digital is likely to be broken up and its assets sold off piecemeal .
speculation about potential buyers has previously centered on european media giants such as vivendi or bertelesmann or on venture capitalist groups .
deloitte & touche are already offering the company 's assets for sale but say they are still hopeful of finding a buyer for the business as a going concern .
meetings will take place on monday and tuesday with an announcement to come as early as wednesday .
merger talks reopen the situation could spell financial disaster for dozens of uk football clubs in england 's first , second and third divisions , due for a slice of tv rights money .
the football league , which oversees the divisions , is owed £ 178.5m by itv digital in tv rights .
the league has pledged to sue itv digital 's owners , media firms granada and carlton , for the money , but there are fears some clubs could go under before any case was settled .
meanwhile other sunday press reports suggest that granada and carlton will reopen talks for a £ 5bn merger in order to placate shareholders for the money lost on itv digital .
