less than 48 hours after being appointed by the military , business leader pedro carmona stood down in the face of massive street protests in support of mr chavez . "
with full responsibility before the nation and the venezuelan people , i present this resignation " pedro carmona former vice-president diosdado cabello has now been sworn in as president , but says he is simply waiting to return the country to his ally mr chavez as soon as he reappears .
the bbc 's nick miles , in caracas , says that mr chavez could arrive in the capital in a matter of an hour or two .
mr carmona , the 60-year-old leader of the fedecamaras business chamber , had apparently lost the support of the military and the national assembly .
after being sworn into office , he quickly dissolved the national assembly and the courts , while promising elections within a year .
but he was soon forced to reverse his decision on the national assembly after armed forces chief general efrain vasquez said he would only support mr carmona if the congress was restored .
he was then forced to suspend the inauguration of his new cabinet .
while this was happening , police were firing water cannon and tear gas to disperse tens of thousands of chavez supporters who had surrounded the presidential palace which had been taken over by troops loyal to mr chavez . "
i , diosdado cabello , am assuming the presidency until such time as the president of the republic , hugo chavez frias , appears " reports said at least nine people had died in clashes between the police and demonstrators .
it is still not clear whether general efrain vasquez will now back the return of mr chavez .
several television stations in caracas have been taken over by supporters of mr chavez .
he himself has not been seen since friday morning , when the armed forces said he had resigned at their request .
mr chavez was initially held at the fuerte tiuna military base in the capital , but there are reports he was later moved to the turiamo naval base on the coast , about 100km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- away .
pro-chavez crowds which gathered in caracas and other venezuelan cities said they were not convinced the president had stepped down .
protesters said they wanted to see the letter of resignation which the provisional government said it had .
mr chavez 's administration fell on friday after violent street demonstrations triggered by a national strike left 13 people dead and more than 240 wounded .
military leaders blamed mr chavez for the deaths and rebelled against him .
mr chavez won a landslide election victory in 1998 , but has recently been facing serious political problems .
the national strike had been called by business and labour leaders after the president appointed his supporters to head the national oil company .
venezuela is the world 's fourth largest oil exporter .
after leaving office , mr chavez reportedly asked for exile in cuba , where his friend and ally fidel castro is in power .
leaders from latin american countries have called meetings to discuss the situation in venezuela and most have not recognised the change of government , although they were critical of mr chavez .

the bbc 's nick miles , in caracas , says that mr chavez could arrive in the capital in a matter of an hour or two .
mr carmona , the 60-year-old leader of the fedecamaras business chamber , had apparently lost the support of the military and the national assembly .
after being sworn into office , he quickly dissolved the national assembly and the courts , while promising elections within a year .
but he was soon forced to reverse his decision on the national assembly after armed forces chief general efrain vasquez said he would only support mr carmona if the congress was restored .
he was then forced to suspend the inauguration of his new cabinet .

he himself has not been seen since friday morning , when the armed forces said he had resigned at their request .
mr chavez was initially held at the fuerte tiuna military base in the capital , but there are reports he was later moved to the turiamo naval base on the coast , about 100km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- away .
pro-chavez crowds which gathered in caracas and other venezuelan cities said they were not convinced the president had stepped down .
protesters said they wanted to see the letter of resignation which the provisional government said it had .
diosdado cabello says he is waiting for mr chavez to return mr chavez 's administration fell on friday after violent street demonstrations triggered by a national strike left 13 people dead and more than 240 wounded .
military leaders blamed mr chavez for the deaths and rebelled against him .
mr chavez won a landslide election victory in 1998 , but has recently been facing serious political problems .
the national strike had been called by business and labour leaders after the president appointed his supporters to head the national oil company .
venezuela is the world 's fourth largest oil exporter .
after leaving office , mr chavez reportedly asked for exile in cuba , where his friend and ally fidel castro is in power .

world 's most heavily armed border separates the two countries under the agreement , 100 south koreans will visit the north for three days from 28 april , and 100 north koreans will make the opposite journey in the following three days .
the agreement to hold a fourth round of reunions came at the inter-korean red cross contact on saturday , and followed talks earlier this month between north korean leader kim jong-il and south korean presidential envoy lim dong-won .
the planned exchange - initially scheduled for october last year - was called off by north korea amid growing tensions between the two neighbours after the 11 september attacks on the united states .
' technically at war ' north korea agreed to accept the delegation from the south at the kumgang mountain resort , which will be inspected by south korean red cross officials next week .
korean accord resumption of family reunions talks on economic co-operation work on cross-border railway the venue in the south is still undecided , and the two sides will hold further talks to work out details .
the two koreas have staged three family reunions for 300 people from each country since an agreement reached at a historic summit between their leaders in 2000 .
in a separate development , south korea said 24 north koreans had arrived in the south after fleeing their famine-stricken country .
it said the defectors included workers , students and a teacher who had made their way to the south through third countries .
no further information was released .
the latest defections brought the number of north koreans to have reached the south this year to 238 .
last year , a record 583 people defected .
south korea usually refers to north korean escapees as defectors , because the two counties remain technically at war as the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce , not a peace treaty .

the untold story of the extraordinary events in venezuela is the dramatically changing role of the venezuelan military , which played a key part in undermining the very people they had appointed .
it was the generals who removed chavez from the presidential palace in caracas on friday .
and it is the generals who forced the resignation of the man they appointed to replace him .
those who thought they had deposed mr chavez appear to have miscalculated the strength of opposition towards him .
wrong predictions when gunmen supporting mr chavez opened fire on the huge demonstration against him on thursday , leaving at least 13 people dead , mr chavez 's opponents thought the last shreds of his credibility had been compromised .
they probably assumed that the brutality of the response to the demonstrators would even have alienated his core supporters in the poor neighbourhoods of caracas .
but the pro-chavez protests on the streets of the capital suggest otherwise .
thousands of poor venezuelans who put their faith in mr chavez 's populist message are prepared to resist what they see as the restoration to power of the business class he had antagonised relentlessly .
the new administration had also struggled to win acceptance internationally , with its latin american neighbours concerned that mr chavez 's removal looked too much like an old-fashioned coup .
