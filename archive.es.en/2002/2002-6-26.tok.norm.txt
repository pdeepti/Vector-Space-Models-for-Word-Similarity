while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .

will doris schröder-kopf , the more visible of the two , help schröder win ? as voters and analysts appear increasingly bored with similar party manifestos , political figures are playing a greater role in this year ’ s german elections than ever before .
if its contrast they want , the difference between the two main party chancellor candidates , gerhard schröder and edmund stoiber , couldn ’ t be greater .
but not only do the two men differ .
there is a striking rift between their two wives , too .
when it comes to the mrs. stoiber and schröder , the alternatives offer their own lesson in political sociology .
family head vs. single mother enter stage right , karin stoiber , 60 years of age , in dark , well-cut suit or dirndl , the traditional bavarian dress and sensible shoes .
the former primary school teacher is mother of three children , and has two grandchildren .
enter stage left , doris schröder-kopf , 38 , in slinky black number , red lips .
a former journalist and recent book writer , schröder-kopf is the mother of an eleven-year-old daughter , klara .
berlin a " strange place " a buxom figure in coiffed blonde hair , karin stoiber is the bavarian catholic .
with her traditionalist family views she is the incorporation of the saying " behind every successful man is a strong woman " .
and husband edmund simply swears on her pork roast .
the stoibers have been married for 34 years , and live in the small town of wolfenhausen , bavaria .
during their marriage , when husband edmund spent days and evenings in the bavarian state parliament , wife and mother karin stayed at home and cared for house , garden and children .
on berlin , karin stoiber says " i have no ties to the city , it is still a strange place " .
and if stoiber wins the coming elections ?
the would-be first lady still sees her life focus at home , in wolfenshausen .
single mother and schröder ’ s fouth wife if karin stoiber ’ s role as bavaria 's first lady is somewhat subdued , reduced to official appearances , sponsoring charity events and dinners , that of doris schröder-kopf as first lady of the nation is much more active .
kopf , who followed her first husband to new york and was left by him later with a small daughter , is schröder ’ s fourth wife .
the political journalist fell in love with the current chancellor during the last election campaign .
according to jürgen hogrefe , publisher of a biography of schröder , " there has never been a more influential political wife " .
since her role as first lady , kopf , who had to drop her profession as a journalist has published various articles , albeit carefully written , on topics ranging from education to nutrition , following the recent food crisis in germany .
despite obvious restraint in her articles , she has been the cause for controversy , not least due to her stance on adopting british-style schooling , urging parents to take on the responsibility for the upbringing of her children in a country which performed poorly in in the recent pisa international education survey .
after the recent food scandal , kopf wrote the lead story for the german tabloid " bild , " titled " what is safe to eat these days ? "
and on topics such as eu expansion , kopf has called for the early entry of turkey to the european union , much to the suspicion of greece .
apart from writing commentaries , schröder-kopf has also taken on a substantial role in the chancellor ’ s election campaign and in boosting his personal popularity .
" i see myself as part of a team around gerhard schröder , people with whom my husband can speak openly " , she said .
but when it comes to engagement , family life still has first priority .
it is due to daughter klara that kopf has decided to reduce her appearances at election rallies in the run-up to the september elections .
" if you make an issue out of family life , then you should stick to your principles and not neglect that family " she said .
traditionalist vs. modern there is no question that schröder-kopf holds greater appeal to the more modern , younger voter .
the former single mother -lrb- photo -rrb- is extremely popular with young families , especially after she published a book on politics for children several months ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , karin stoibers conservatism may well appear all the more reassuring in times where the divorce rate and number of single mothers has never been so high - especially after september 11 , with family ties and the current constant search for the lasting , the stable and the permanent .
so , as the elections near , the two first ladies may play a more substantial role in the outcome than previously assumed .
will it be bavarian dirndls or the slinky black number ?
restraint or going all out ?
wolfenhausen or hanover ?
karin or doris ? send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

will doris schröder-kopf , the more visible of the two , help schröder win ? as voters and analysts appear increasingly bored with similar party manifestos , political figures are playing a greater role in this year ’ s german elections than ever before .
if its contrast they want , the difference between the two main party chancellor candidates , gerhard schröder and edmund stoiber , couldn ’ t be greater .
but not only do the two men differ .
there is a striking rift between their two wives , too .
when it comes to the mrs. stoiber and schröder , the alternatives offer their own lesson in political sociology .

while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .
according to recent statistics , the numbers of " manga shojos " -lrb- " comic girls " -rrb- are still very much on the rise .

while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .

will doris schröder-kopf , the more visible of the two , help schröder win ? as voters and analysts appear increasingly bored with similar party manifestos , political figures are playing a greater role in this year ’ s german elections than ever before .
if its contrast they want , the difference between the two main party chancellor candidates , gerhard schröder and edmund stoiber , couldn ’ t be greater .
but not only do the two men differ .
there is a striking rift between their two wives , too .
when it comes to the mrs. stoiber and schröder , the alternatives offer their own lesson in political sociology .
family head vs. single mother enter stage right , karin stoiber , 60 years of age , in dark , well-cut suit or dirndl , the traditional bavarian dress and sensible shoes .
the former primary school teacher is mother of three children , and has two grandchildren .

a former journalist and recent book writer , schröder-kopf is the mother of an eleven-year-old daughter , klara .

with her traditionalist family views she is the incorporation of the saying " behind every successful man is a strong woman " .
and husband edmund simply swears on her pork roast .
the stoibers have been married for 34 years , and live in the small town of wolfenhausen , bavaria .
during their marriage , when husband edmund spent days and evenings in the bavarian state parliament , wife and mother karin stayed at home and cared for house , garden and children .
on berlin , karin stoiber says " i have no ties to the city , it is still a strange place " .
and if stoiber wins the coming elections ?
the would-be first lady still sees her life focus at home , in wolfenshausen .
single mother and schröder ’ s fouth wife if karin stoiber ’ s role as bavaria 's first lady is somewhat subdued , reduced to official appearances , sponsoring charity events and dinners , that of doris schröder-kopf as first lady of the nation is much more active .
kopf , who followed her first husband to new york and was left by him later with a small daughter , is schröder ’ s fourth wife .
the political journalist fell in love with the current chancellor during the last election campaign .
according to jürgen hogrefe , publisher of a biography of schröder , " there has never been a more influential political wife " .
since her role as first lady , kopf , who had to drop her profession as a journalist has published various articles , albeit carefully written , on topics ranging from education to nutrition , following the recent food crisis in germany .
despite obvious restraint in her articles , she has been the cause for controversy , not least due to her stance on adopting british-style schooling , urging parents to take on the responsibility for the upbringing of her children in a country which performed poorly in in the recent pisa international education survey .
after the recent food scandal , kopf wrote the lead story for the german tabloid " bild , " titled " what is safe to eat these days ? "
and on topics such as eu expansion , kopf has called for the early entry of turkey to the european union , much to the suspicion of greece .
apart from writing commentaries , schröder-kopf has also taken on a substantial role in the chancellor ’ s election campaign and in boosting his personal popularity .
" i see myself as part of a team around gerhard schröder , people with whom my husband can speak openly " , she said .
but when it comes to engagement , family life still has first priority .
it is due to daughter klara that kopf has decided to reduce her appearances at election rallies in the run-up to the september elections .
" if you make an issue out of family life , then you should stick to your principles and not neglect that family " she said .
traditionalist vs. modern there is no question that schröder-kopf holds greater appeal to the more modern , younger voter .
the former single mother -lrb- photo -rrb- is extremely popular with young families , especially after she published a book on politics for children several months ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , karin stoibers conservatism may well appear all the more reassuring in times where the divorce rate and number of single mothers has never been so high - especially after september 11 , with family ties and the current constant search for the lasting , the stable and the permanent .
so , as the elections near , the two first ladies may play a more substantial role in the outcome than previously assumed .

a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .

will doris schröder-kopf , the more visible of the two , help schröder win ? as voters and analysts appear increasingly bored with similar party manifestos , political figures are playing a greater role in this year ’ s german elections than ever before .
if its contrast they want , the difference between the two main party chancellor candidates , gerhard schröder and edmund stoiber , couldn ’ t be greater .
but not only do the two men differ .
there is a striking rift between their two wives , too .
when it comes to the mrs. stoiber and schröder , the alternatives offer their own lesson in political sociology .
family head vs. single mother enter stage right , karin stoiber , 60 years of age , in dark , well-cut suit or dirndl , the traditional bavarian dress and sensible shoes .
the former primary school teacher is mother of three children , and has two grandchildren .
enter stage left , doris schröder-kopf , 38 , in slinky black number , red lips .
a former journalist and recent book writer , schröder-kopf is the mother of an eleven-year-old daughter , klara .
berlin a " strange place " a buxom figure in coiffed blonde hair , karin stoiber is the bavarian catholic .
with her traditionalist family views she is the incorporation of the saying " behind every successful man is a strong woman " .
and husband edmund simply swears on her pork roast .
the stoibers have been married for 34 years , and live in the small town of wolfenhausen , bavaria .
during their marriage , when husband edmund spent days and evenings in the bavarian state parliament , wife and mother karin stayed at home and cared for house , garden and children .
on berlin , karin stoiber says " i have no ties to the city , it is still a strange place " .
and if stoiber wins the coming elections ?
the would-be first lady still sees her life focus at home , in wolfenshausen .
single mother and schröder ’ s fouth wife if karin stoiber ’ s role as bavaria 's first lady is somewhat subdued , reduced to official appearances , sponsoring charity events and dinners , that of doris schröder-kopf as first lady of the nation is much more active .
kopf , who followed her first husband to new york and was left by him later with a small daughter , is schröder ’ s fourth wife .
the political journalist fell in love with the current chancellor during the last election campaign .
according to jürgen hogrefe , publisher of a biography of schröder , " there has never been a more influential political wife " .
since her role as first lady , kopf , who had to drop her profession as a journalist has published various articles , albeit carefully written , on topics ranging from education to nutrition , following the recent food crisis in germany .
despite obvious restraint in her articles , she has been the cause for controversy , not least due to her stance on adopting british-style schooling , urging parents to take on the responsibility for the upbringing of her children in a country which performed poorly in in the recent pisa international education survey .
after the recent food scandal , kopf wrote the lead story for the german tabloid " bild , " titled " what is safe to eat these days ? "
and on topics such as eu expansion , kopf has called for the early entry of turkey to the european union , much to the suspicion of greece .
apart from writing commentaries , schröder-kopf has also taken on a substantial role in the chancellor ’ s election campaign and in boosting his personal popularity .
" i see myself as part of a team around gerhard schröder , people with whom my husband can speak openly " , she said .
but when it comes to engagement , family life still has first priority .
it is due to daughter klara that kopf has decided to reduce her appearances at election rallies in the run-up to the september elections .
" if you make an issue out of family life , then you should stick to your principles and not neglect that family " she said .
traditionalist vs. modern there is no question that schröder-kopf holds greater appeal to the more modern , younger voter .
the former single mother -lrb- photo -rrb- is extremely popular with young families , especially after she published a book on politics for children several months ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , karin stoibers conservatism may well appear all the more reassuring in times where the divorce rate and number of single mothers has never been so high - especially after september 11 , with family ties and the current constant search for the lasting , the stable and the permanent .
so , as the elections near , the two first ladies may play a more substantial role in the outcome than previously assumed .
will it be bavarian dirndls or the slinky black number ?
restraint or going all out ?
wolfenhausen or hanover ?
karin or doris ? send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .
according to recent statistics , the numbers of " manga shojos " -lrb- " comic girls " -rrb- are still very much on the rise .
and as birthe and her friends come of age , they can look forward to yet another hit from the far east that is becoming increasingly popular in europe : " lady comics " , tacky but nevertheless intriguing stories about young female business executives falling in and out of love with their male colleagues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links manga comic website information on japanese comics , videos , and accessories 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the former primary school teacher is mother of three children , and has two grandchildren .

with her traditionalist family views she is the incorporation of the saying " behind every successful man is a strong woman " .
and husband edmund simply swears on her pork roast .
the stoibers have been married for 34 years , and live in the small town of wolfenhausen , bavaria .
during their marriage , when husband edmund spent days and evenings in the bavarian state parliament , wife and mother karin stayed at home and cared for house , garden and children .

the would-be first lady still sees her life focus at home , in wolfenshausen .

kopf , who followed her first husband to new york and was left by him later with a small daughter , is schröder ’ s fourth wife .
the political journalist fell in love with the current chancellor during the last election campaign .
according to jürgen hogrefe , publisher of a biography of schröder , " there has never been a more influential political wife " .
since her role as first lady , kopf , who had to drop her profession as a journalist has published various articles , albeit carefully written , on topics ranging from education to nutrition , following the recent food crisis in germany .
despite obvious restraint in her articles , she has been the cause for controversy , not least due to her stance on adopting british-style schooling , urging parents to take on the responsibility for the upbringing of her children in a country which performed poorly in in the recent pisa international education survey .
after the recent food scandal , kopf wrote the lead story for the german tabloid " bild , " titled " what is safe to eat these days ? "
and on topics such as eu expansion , kopf has called for the early entry of turkey to the european union , much to the suspicion of greece .
apart from writing commentaries , schröder-kopf has also taken on a substantial role in the chancellor ’ s election campaign and in boosting his personal popularity .
" i see myself as part of a team around gerhard schröder , people with whom my husband can speak openly " , she said .
but when it comes to engagement , family life still has first priority .
it is due to daughter klara that kopf has decided to reduce her appearances at election rallies in the run-up to the september elections .
" if you make an issue out of family life , then you should stick to your principles and not neglect that family " she said .
traditionalist vs. modern there is no question that schröder-kopf holds greater appeal to the more modern , younger voter .
the former single mother -lrb- photo -rrb- is extremely popular with young families , especially after she published a book on politics for children several months ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , karin stoibers conservatism may well appear all the more reassuring in times where the divorce rate and number of single mothers has never been so high - especially after september 11 , with family ties and the current constant search for the lasting , the stable and the permanent .
so , as the elections near , the two first ladies may play a more substantial role in the outcome than previously assumed .

while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .
according to recent statistics , the numbers of " manga shojos " -lrb- " comic girls " -rrb- are still very much on the rise .
and as birthe and her friends come of age , they can look forward to yet another hit from the far east that is becoming increasingly popular in europe : " lady comics " , tacky but nevertheless intriguing stories about young female business executives falling in and out of love with their male colleagues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links manga comic website information on japanese comics , videos , and accessories 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

will doris schröder-kopf , the more visible of the two , help schröder win ? as voters and analysts appear increasingly bored with similar party manifestos , political figures are playing a greater role in this year ’ s german elections than ever before .
if its contrast they want , the difference between the two main party chancellor candidates , gerhard schröder and edmund stoiber , couldn ’ t be greater .
but not only do the two men differ .
there is a striking rift between their two wives , too .
when it comes to the mrs. stoiber and schröder , the alternatives offer their own lesson in political sociology .

single mother and schröder ’ s fouth wife if karin stoiber ’ s role as bavaria 's first lady is somewhat subdued , reduced to official appearances , sponsoring charity events and dinners , that of doris schröder-kopf as first lady of the nation is much more active .
kopf , who followed her first husband to new york and was left by him later with a small daughter , is schröder ’ s fourth wife .
the political journalist fell in love with the current chancellor during the last election campaign .
according to jürgen hogrefe , publisher of a biography of schröder , " there has never been a more influential political wife " .
since her role as first lady , kopf , who had to drop her profession as a journalist has published various articles , albeit carefully written , on topics ranging from education to nutrition , following the recent food crisis in germany .
despite obvious restraint in her articles , she has been the cause for controversy , not least due to her stance on adopting british-style schooling , urging parents to take on the responsibility for the upbringing of her children in a country which performed poorly in in the recent pisa international education survey .
after the recent food scandal , kopf wrote the lead story for the german tabloid " bild , " titled " what is safe to eat these days ? "
and on topics such as eu expansion , kopf has called for the early entry of turkey to the european union , much to the suspicion of greece .
apart from writing commentaries , schröder-kopf has also taken on a substantial role in the chancellor ’ s election campaign and in boosting his personal popularity .
" i see myself as part of a team around gerhard schröder , people with whom my husband can speak openly " , she said .
but when it comes to engagement , family life still has first priority .
it is due to daughter klara that kopf has decided to reduce her appearances at election rallies in the run-up to the september elections .
" if you make an issue out of family life , then you should stick to your principles and not neglect that family " she said .
traditionalist vs. modern there is no question that schröder-kopf holds greater appeal to the more modern , younger voter .
the former single mother -lrb- photo -rrb- is extremely popular with young families , especially after she published a book on politics for children several months ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , karin stoibers conservatism may well appear all the more reassuring in times where the divorce rate and number of single mothers has never been so high - especially after september 11 , with family ties and the current constant search for the lasting , the stable and the permanent .

while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .
according to recent statistics , the numbers of " manga shojos " -lrb- " comic girls " -rrb- are still very much on the rise .

while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .
according to recent statistics , the numbers of " manga shojos " -lrb- " comic girls " -rrb- are still very much on the rise .
and as birthe and her friends come of age , they can look forward to yet another hit from the far east that is becoming increasingly popular in europe : " lady comics " , tacky but nevertheless intriguing stories about young female business executives falling in and out of love with their male colleagues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links manga comic website information on japanese comics , videos , and accessories media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

when it comes to the mrs. stoiber and schröder , the alternatives offer their own lesson in political sociology .

the former primary school teacher is mother of three children , and has two grandchildren .

the stoibers have been married for 34 years , and live in the small town of wolfenhausen , bavaria .
during their marriage , when husband edmund spent days and evenings in the bavarian state parliament , wife and mother karin stayed at home and cared for house , garden and children .
on berlin , karin stoiber says " i have no ties to the city , it is still a strange place " .
and if stoiber wins the coming elections ?
the would-be first lady still sees her life focus at home , in wolfenshausen .
single mother and schröder ’ s fouth wife if karin stoiber ’ s role as bavaria 's first lady is somewhat subdued , reduced to official appearances , sponsoring charity events and dinners , that of doris schröder-kopf as first lady of the nation is much more active .
kopf , who followed her first husband to new york and was left by him later with a small daughter , is schröder ’ s fourth wife .
the political journalist fell in love with the current chancellor during the last election campaign .
according to jürgen hogrefe , publisher of a biography of schröder , " there has never been a more influential political wife " .
since her role as first lady , kopf , who had to drop her profession as a journalist has published various articles , albeit carefully written , on topics ranging from education to nutrition , following the recent food crisis in germany .
despite obvious restraint in her articles , she has been the cause for controversy , not least due to her stance on adopting british-style schooling , urging parents to take on the responsibility for the upbringing of her children in a country which performed poorly in in the recent pisa international education survey .
after the recent food scandal , kopf wrote the lead story for the german tabloid " bild , " titled " what is safe to eat these days ? "
and on topics such as eu expansion , kopf has called for the early entry of turkey to the european union , much to the suspicion of greece .
apart from writing commentaries , schröder-kopf has also taken on a substantial role in the chancellor ’ s election campaign and in boosting his personal popularity .
" i see myself as part of a team around gerhard schröder , people with whom my husband can speak openly " , she said .
but when it comes to engagement , family life still has first priority .
it is due to daughter klara that kopf has decided to reduce her appearances at election rallies in the run-up to the september elections .
" if you make an issue out of family life , then you should stick to your principles and not neglect that family " she said .
traditionalist vs. modern there is no question that schröder-kopf holds greater appeal to the more modern , younger voter .
the former single mother -lrb- photo -rrb- is extremely popular with young families , especially after she published a book on politics for children several months ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.06.2002 manga girls versus spiderman großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful and exotic japanese comics appeal to european girls the newest comic craze from japan conquers europe .
while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .
according to recent statistics , the numbers of " manga shojos " -lrb- " comic girls " -rrb- are still very much on the rise .
and as birthe and her friends come of age , they can look forward to yet another hit from the far east that is becoming increasingly popular in europe : " lady comics " , tacky but nevertheless intriguing stories about young female business executives falling in and out of love with their male colleagues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links manga comic website information on japanese comics , videos , and accessories media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the stoibers have been married for 34 years , and live in the small town of wolfenhausen , bavaria .

since her role as first lady , kopf , who had to drop her profession as a journalist has published various articles , albeit carefully written , on topics ranging from education to nutrition , following the recent food crisis in germany .
despite obvious restraint in her articles , she has been the cause for controversy , not least due to her stance on adopting british-style schooling , urging parents to take on the responsibility for the upbringing of her children in a country which performed poorly in in the recent pisa international education survey .

" i see myself as part of a team around gerhard schröder , people with whom my husband can speak openly " , she said .
but when it comes to engagement , family life still has first priority .
it is due to daughter klara that kopf has decided to reduce her appearances at election rallies in the run-up to the september elections .
" if you make an issue out of family life , then you should stick to your principles and not neglect that family " she said .
traditionalist vs. modern there is no question that schröder-kopf holds greater appeal to the more modern , younger voter .
the former single mother -lrb- photo -rrb- is extremely popular with young families , especially after she published a book on politics for children several months ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , karin stoibers conservatism may well appear all the more reassuring in times where the divorce rate and number of single mothers has never been so high - especially after september 11 , with family ties and the current constant search for the lasting , the stable and the permanent .

while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .
according to recent statistics , the numbers of " manga shojos " -lrb- " comic girls " -rrb- are still very much on the rise .
and as birthe and her friends come of age , they can look forward to yet another hit from the far east that is becoming increasingly popular in europe : " lady comics " , tacky but nevertheless intriguing stories about young female business executives falling in and out of love with their male colleagues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links manga comic website information on japanese comics , videos , and accessories 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .
according to recent statistics , the numbers of " manga shojos " -lrb- " comic girls " -rrb- are still very much on the rise .
and as birthe and her friends come of age , they can look forward to yet another hit from the far east that is becoming increasingly popular in europe : " lady comics " , tacky but nevertheless intriguing stories about young female business executives falling in and out of love with their male colleagues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links manga comic website information on japanese comics , videos , and accessories 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "

monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .

dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .

while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .
according to recent statistics , the numbers of " manga shojos " -lrb- " comic girls " -rrb- are still very much on the rise .
and as birthe and her friends come of age , they can look forward to yet another hit from the far east that is becoming increasingly popular in europe : " lady comics " , tacky but nevertheless intriguing stories about young female business executives falling in and out of love with their male colleagues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links manga comic website information on japanese comics , videos , and accessories 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

if its contrast they want , the difference between the two main party chancellor candidates , gerhard schröder and edmund stoiber , couldn ’ t be greater .
but not only do the two men differ .
there is a striking rift between their two wives , too .
when it comes to the mrs. stoiber and schröder , the alternatives offer their own lesson in political sociology .

the former primary school teacher is mother of three children , and has two grandchildren .

the stoibers have been married for 34 years , and live in the small town of wolfenhausen , bavaria .
during their marriage , when husband edmund spent days and evenings in the bavarian state parliament , wife and mother karin stayed at home and cared for house , garden and children .

the would-be first lady still sees her life focus at home , in wolfenshausen .
single mother and schröder ’ s fouth wife if karin stoiber ’ s role as bavaria 's first lady is somewhat subdued , reduced to official appearances , sponsoring charity events and dinners , that of doris schröder-kopf as first lady of the nation is much more active .
kopf , who followed her first husband to new york and was left by him later with a small daughter , is schröder ’ s fourth wife .
the political journalist fell in love with the current chancellor during the last election campaign .
according to jürgen hogrefe , publisher of a biography of schröder , " there has never been a more influential political wife " .
since her role as first lady , kopf , who had to drop her profession as a journalist has published various articles , albeit carefully written , on topics ranging from education to nutrition , following the recent food crisis in germany .
despite obvious restraint in her articles , she has been the cause for controversy , not least due to her stance on adopting british-style schooling , urging parents to take on the responsibility for the upbringing of her children in a country which performed poorly in in the recent pisa international education survey .
after the recent food scandal , kopf wrote the lead story for the german tabloid " bild , " titled " what is safe to eat these days ? "
and on topics such as eu expansion , kopf has called for the early entry of turkey to the european union , much to the suspicion of greece .
apart from writing commentaries , schröder-kopf has also taken on a substantial role in the chancellor ’ s election campaign and in boosting his personal popularity .
" i see myself as part of a team around gerhard schröder , people with whom my husband can speak openly " , she said .
but when it comes to engagement , family life still has first priority .
it is due to daughter klara that kopf has decided to reduce her appearances at election rallies in the run-up to the september elections .
" if you make an issue out of family life , then you should stick to your principles and not neglect that family " she said .
traditionalist vs. modern there is no question that schröder-kopf holds greater appeal to the more modern , younger voter .
the former single mother -lrb- photo -rrb- is extremely popular with young families , especially after she published a book on politics for children several months ago .

according to jürgen hogrefe , publisher of a biography of schröder , " there has never been a more influential political wife " .
since her role as first lady , kopf , who had to drop her profession as a journalist has published various articles , albeit carefully written , on topics ranging from education to nutrition , following the recent food crisis in germany .
despite obvious restraint in her articles , she has been the cause for controversy , not least due to her stance on adopting british-style schooling , urging parents to take on the responsibility for the upbringing of her children in a country which performed poorly in in the recent pisa international education survey .
after the recent food scandal , kopf wrote the lead story for the german tabloid " bild , " titled " what is safe to eat these days ? "
and on topics such as eu expansion , kopf has called for the early entry of turkey to the european union , much to the suspicion of greece .
apart from writing commentaries , schröder-kopf has also taken on a substantial role in the chancellor ’ s election campaign and in boosting his personal popularity .
" i see myself as part of a team around gerhard schröder , people with whom my husband can speak openly " , she said .
but when it comes to engagement , family life still has first priority .
it is due to daughter klara that kopf has decided to reduce her appearances at election rallies in the run-up to the september elections .
" if you make an issue out of family life , then you should stick to your principles and not neglect that family " she said .
traditionalist vs. modern there is no question that schröder-kopf holds greater appeal to the more modern , younger voter .
the former single mother -lrb- photo -rrb- is extremely popular with young families , especially after she published a book on politics for children several months ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , karin stoibers conservatism may well appear all the more reassuring in times where the divorce rate and number of single mothers has never been so high - especially after september 11 , with family ties and the current constant search for the lasting , the stable and the permanent .

will doris schröder-kopf , the more visible of the two , help schröder win ? as voters and analysts appear increasingly bored with similar party manifestos , political figures are playing a greater role in this year ’ s german elections than ever before .
if its contrast they want , the difference between the two main party chancellor candidates , gerhard schröder and edmund stoiber , couldn ’ t be greater .
but not only do the two men differ .
there is a striking rift between their two wives , too .
when it comes to the mrs. stoiber and schröder , the alternatives offer their own lesson in political sociology .
family head vs. single mother enter stage right , karin stoiber , 60 years of age , in dark , well-cut suit or dirndl , the traditional bavarian dress and sensible shoes .
the former primary school teacher is mother of three children , and has two grandchildren .
enter stage left , doris schröder-kopf , 38 , in slinky black number , red lips .
a former journalist and recent book writer , schröder-kopf is the mother of an eleven-year-old daughter , klara .
berlin a " strange place " a buxom figure in coiffed blonde hair , karin stoiber is the bavarian catholic .
with her traditionalist family views she is the incorporation of the saying " behind every successful man is a strong woman " .
and husband edmund simply swears on her pork roast .
the stoibers have been married for 34 years , and live in the small town of wolfenhausen , bavaria .
during their marriage , when husband edmund spent days and evenings in the bavarian state parliament , wife and mother karin stayed at home and cared for house , garden and children .
on berlin , karin stoiber says " i have no ties to the city , it is still a strange place " .
and if stoiber wins the coming elections ?
the would-be first lady still sees her life focus at home , in wolfenshausen .
single mother and schröder ’ s fouth wife if karin stoiber ’ s role as bavaria 's first lady is somewhat subdued , reduced to official appearances , sponsoring charity events and dinners , that of doris schröder-kopf as first lady of the nation is much more active .
kopf , who followed her first husband to new york and was left by him later with a small daughter , is schröder ’ s fourth wife .
the political journalist fell in love with the current chancellor during the last election campaign .
according to jürgen hogrefe , publisher of a biography of schröder , " there has never been a more influential political wife " .

while teenage girls are fascinated with their exotic new heroes , their parents are concerned about what they consider inappropriate content . to most parents , the idea of children spending all their pocket money on comic books and video games is a very disturbing one , to say the least .
the father of 13-year-old monika from stuttgart is no exception .
monika , who calls herself " moni shojo " -lrb- shojo being japanese for " young girl " -rrb- when chatting with friends in the manga chat room of the german based carlsen comics publishing house , complains about how her dad " just doesn ’ t get it . "
what he doesn ’ t quite understand is monika ’ s hobby : manga comics .
in particular , it ’ s the fact that monika already spent most of her allowance on the " dragon ball " series and just asked for a loan to buy the brand new dragon ball bed sheets that upsets both her parents .
" well , fine , " writes monika on the fan web site , " i guess it ’ s delivering newspapers then for the rest of the summer .
i want those sheets and i ’ ll get them .
dragon ball rules ! "
a female " spiderman " " mangas " -lrb- japanese for " pictures " -rrb- are the newest craze in comics .
ever since " dragon ball " , the most successful of the japanese comics , came out in 1997 , german kids between the ages of three and thirteen have followed japanese teenagers in " manga mania . "
what ’ s most surprising about this new trend is the fact that young girls make up the majority of readers .
this is especially true for the manga fan clubs which have experienced a major boom not only in germany , but in other european countries as well .
while their male classmates or " shonen " -lrb- boys -rrb- dream of becoming the spidermen and batmen of the future , european girls increasingly find their role models in tough , always-on-the-go action heroes like the female main character in " sailor moon " .
this comic strip , mainly targeting teenage girls , has recently been made into a successful tv show and several movies , most of which are shown on german cable channels .
crazed teenagers , concerned parents but while european teenage girls are very much into the manga cult and eager to purchase as many dragon ball and sailor moon comics and accessories as possible , the new trend has started a controversy among parents .
many parents support manga comics because they feel they introduce their youngsters to foreign cultures .
at the same time , they are also concerned about other aspects connected to the manga craze .
european parents find it hard to understand how japanese men can sit with their heads buried in comic books on rush-hour trains without any sense of embarrassment .
while in the west mainstream comics are almost entirely for children , in japan there are many types of manga – and some of them are most definitely not suitable for children .
graphic violence and sex have been commonplace in manga for years .
even a japanese law introduced to curb child pornography excluded manga .
and while japanese parents seem to utter little concern about the alleged pornographic aspect of manga culture , many european and especially german parents feel that something should be done to keep out the inappropriate content .
exotic and ambiguous in germany , the controversy is in full swing .
most recently , " spiegel online " contributed to the ongoing discussion in a feature titled " manga chutney " .
in the article , 13-year-old birthe claußen from hamburg was interviewed about what started her fascination with the japanese girl ’ s comic " sailor moon " .
at first , birthe says , she did not quite comprehend what she saw , but was nevertheless fascinated by the artistic qualities of the strip : " i had never seen drawings like that .
the pictures where mind-blowing , the pace of the stories breathtaking and the characters cute .
the plot seemed to be odd and confusing at first , but after a while their humor really grew on me . "
that was four years ago when birthe was twelve .
now , she owns 42 issues of the series and the walls of her room are plastered with sailor moon and dragon ball posters and pictures of her heroines that she drew herself .
with a total of more than six million copies , her favorite dragon ball is the undisputed bestseller among the manga comics sold in europe , and the film version ranks in second position with german kids .
from insider tip to market leader what started out as a tip among insiders has now become a major market .
more than 50 different series appear every month .
certain issues have sold more than 200,000 copies and outranked even traditional comics like superman and batman .
at the hamburg carlsen comics headquarters , home of french comic classics such as " asterix " and " gaston " , editors say the new comics from the far east constitute more than eighty percent of their profits .
" this is a major revolution within the european comics market , " says joachim kaps , head of marketing at carlsen .
" with manga we finally managed to regain our position as market leader and reach target groups that were out of reach before . "
manga and beyond apart from the exotic drawings , what teenage girls like monika and birthe find particularly intriguing is the ambiguity of the heroes ’ gender and character .
the male hero in " ranma ½ " , for instance , turns into a girl when coming into contact with water , and he / she , as well as the remaining characters in the series , are neither good nor evil .
" manga are just more sophisticated and detailed than traditional comics , " says birthe .
most of her girlfriends agree with her on this point , which seems to be the main reason for the huge success of manga comics in europe .
according to recent statistics , the numbers of " manga shojos " -lrb- " comic girls " -rrb- are still very much on the rise .
and as birthe and her friends come of age , they can look forward to yet another hit from the far east that is becoming increasingly popular in europe : " lady comics " , tacky but nevertheless intriguing stories about young female business executives falling in and out of love with their male colleagues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links manga comic website information on japanese comics , videos , and accessories 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

uk prime minister tony blair and uk foreign secretary jack straw both said it was up to the palestinian people to choose their own leader . "
it is for the palestinian people to choose their own leader " downing street mr bush and mr blair are due to discuss the matter in private talks on wednesday , during the g8 summit in canada .
several uk newspapers say the issue could mark the first serious rift between the two leaders since 11 september .
mr blair tried to play down the policy difference on tuesday evening , telling the bbc on the flight to canada : " i do n't think there is any real difference at all .
we all want someone we can deal with on the palestinian side .
" they 've got to choose their own leaders - but we do need interlocuters with whom we can work seriously , particularly on the security and counter-terrorism aspect . "
he added : " i think there will be a very broad measure of agreement ... whatever people may think of yasser arafat . "
' potentially damaging ' mr blair 's official spokesman said that because the two governments were not using " precisely the same language " , it did not mean that britain did not broadly welcome mr bush 's initiative .
earlier in the commons , mr straw broadly welcomed mr bush 's peace plans , but said that if mr arafat was re-elected in fresh elections , britain would continue to work with him .
mr straw 's aides later pointed to a speech he gave last month in which he acknowledged differences of approach between the eu and us , but said both were " mature enough to cope with dissent and debate " .
donald anderson , chairman of the house of commons foreign affairs select committee , told bbc radio 4 's today programme there was clearly a difference in emphasis between the us and uk .
referring to mr bush 's speech , he said : " it is a dangerous doctrine , indeed impertinent , to tell to one side in the conflict that we insist that you change your leadership . "
the tories warned that any sign of a rift between britain and the us would only serve to undermine hopes of reviving the peace process in the middle-east .
shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said a split was " potentially highly damaging to the peace process in the middle east and to the ability of president bush 's statement to move forward the peace process . "
world unease bbc correspondent mark mardell said that as mr blair has often been portrayed as mr bush 's " poodle " on foreign policy matters , " downing street wo n't mind too much if there 's now seen to be a little light between them " .
mr arafat himself has brushed off the call for the palestinians to find a new leader , saying he was democratically elected and that it is up to the palestinian people alone to choose .
other world leaders have expressed unease at the call for him to go .
" the palestinian people will alone decide who is their legitimate leader , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
un secretary general kofi annan , who will participate in the g8 summit , welcomed the idea of a state of palestine but avoided comment on the call to replace mr arafat .

the package was among a number of measures agreed between france and the uk in an attempt to progress to the eventual closure of the nearby sangatte refugee camp .
but france said it would not set a date for closure of the camp - which has been described as a springboard for illegal immigrants trying to reach the uk - until the uk toughened up its immigration laws .
the measures were agreed at a meeting in london between uk home secretary david blunkett and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy .
agreed measures uk will fund £ 5m security measures at frethun more uk-france joint police operations uk will consider compulsory id cards france may set a date for closing sangatte after uk immigration legislation is changed the £ 5m will fund fencing , alarms and surveillance equipment worth about £ 5m at the frethun rail freight depot near the tunnel entrance .
groups of refugees from sangatte have been trying to break into frethun and board the trains on a nightly basis - which has led to severely disrupted freight services .
there will be more joint operations between uk and french intelligence to crack down on people-traffickers .
mr blunkett also said he would publish a consultation paper on identity cards .
this was welcomed by france , which has called on britain to tackle the so-called " pull factors " attracting people to the uk .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy said the closure of sangatte remained a goal , because the issue had been " poisoning " relations between the two countries .
he said he would set a date for the closure of the camp after the uk 's new asylum and immigration bill - currently working its way through parliament - was in place .
' new legislation ' " for us closing sangatte remains an objective , " he told a news conference .
" and as soon as new legislation is in force we will be ready to commit to a timetable . "
mr blunkett said afterwards he hoped the measures would " actually get this matter resolved once and for all . "
the red cross-run camp houses about 1,500 refugees and has been a bone of contention between the two countries for some months .
the home office estimates that 1,000 illegal immigrants try to access the uk through the tunnel each week .
further negotiations between the two ministers will be held in paris on 12 july .

abu sabaya , one of the leaders of the abu sayyaf group notorious for kidnappings , is believed to have been shot in the back in a shoot-out with troops last friday .
abu sabaya led the kidnap of us hostages the military has been hunting for his body in an 800 square-kilometre -lrb- 307 square-mile -rrb- section of the sulu sea , off southern zamboanga del norte province .

speaking at a breakfast meeting on wednesday , the president said a $ 1,000- -lrb- 50,000 peso- -rrb- reward for the discovery of mr sabaya 's body would motivate local fishermen to continue the search .
but there has been some speculation in the local media that mr sabaya might not be dead .

mr sabaya and a handful of followers had fled following a shoot-out with the military earlier this month which resulted in the deaths of us hostage martin burnham and a filipina nurse , ediborah yap .
the group had been holding the hostages in dense jungles for more than a year .
mr burnham 's wife gracia survived the gun battle and has returned to the us .

bbc news online spoke to the man behind it all .
michael eavis , the dairy farmer who throws the biggest party of the uk 's festival season , could not be more removed from the glamour and arrogance of the music industry if he tried . "
it 's very satisfying for me to know that we can make a difference " michael eavis just one day before the gates opened to welcome 100,000 fans into glastonbury 2002 , eavis was out on the streets of pilton , the nearby village , making sure a schoolbus got through a tight security cordon that had been thrown around the site .
" the bus did n't get the right passes in its windscreen or something , " eavis says .
" so i had to go down there , move all the blockades , get the bus into the village , load it up with kids and then get it out again .
" it 's quite a major event , moving all the barriers and all the vans and everything , and all these security people are all standing in the way .
personal touch " i was out there directing traffic for about 45 minutes to get the kids to the village school .
that was n't my job , but it was this morning . "
that is the story of eavis 's attitude - he is not in it for the ego or the money , and wants to do the right thing as well as give everything a personal touch .
after ushering the schoolbus through the village , he was on the phone to the supplier of eggs for the site canteen , complaining that they had got battery instead of free range .
part of the reason he has time to do these things is his new partnership with live music giant mean fiddler , who are in charge of the " nuts and bolts " of the festival - traffic , security , health and safety .
apprenticeship " all the stuff i did n't enjoy anyway , " eavis says .
he and mean fiddler managing director melvin benn have rekindled a working relationship that once saw benn serve his apprenticeship at glastonbury . "
as long as the festival lives and breathes like it does at the moment , it will certainly continue " michael eavis the pair are now " working quite well together " , eavis says .
" melvin 's in charge of the operational stuff , which frees me up to do all sorts of things that i enjoy doing .
melvin 's there with his shorts on now , wandering about everywhere with a radio in his hand . "
that has pleased the police , eavis says , who used to get frustrated that eavis rode around the site on his bicycle without so much as a mobile phone .
fans had been concerned that the mean fiddler involvement would destroy the festival 's fabled " hippy " spirit , and would mark the beginning of the end for the special atmosphere that other festivals seem unable to match .
safety fears but eavis is adamant that he is still in full control of the " artistic and emotive stuff " , whereas mean fiddler just " keep the wheels turning " .
safety fears pose the biggest threat to the festival 's future , prompting eavis to erect a £ 1m " super-fence " to keep thousands of gatecrashers out .
eavis is convinced that it will do its job , and that the festival will go on .
he certainly shows little desire to retire .
" as long as the festival lives and breathes like it does at the moment , it will certainly continue , " he says .
more exciting " it 's got so much energy to it , so much positive feeling about it , and everyone on board is throwing everything at it .
it 's so good . "
he says it is now more exciting than when he started in 1970 , because he can raise more money for charities like greenpeace , oxfam and water aid .
" there are reasons to keep me motivated and happy and excited about it - and the reasons are that we can put so much back into our society , and even into countries around the world as well , " he says .

bbc news online spoke to the man behind it all .
michael eavis , the dairy farmer who throws the biggest party of the uk 's festival season , could not be more removed from the glamour and arrogance of the music industry if he tried .
it 's very satisfying for me to know that we can make a difference michael eavis just one day before the gates opened to welcome 100,000 fans into glastonbury 2002 , eavis was out on the streets of pilton , the nearby village , making sure a schoolbus got through a tight security cordon that had been thrown around the site .
" the bus did n't get the right passes in its windscreen or something , " eavis says .
" so i had to go down there , move all the blockades , get the bus into the village , load it up with kids and then get it out again .
" it 's quite a major event , moving all the barriers and all the vans and everything , and all these security people are all standing in the way .
personal touch " i was out there directing traffic for about 45 minutes to get the kids to the village school .
that was n't my job , but it was this morning . "
that is the story of eavis 's attitude - he is not in it for the ego or the money , and wants to do the right thing as well as give everything a personal touch .
glastonbury becomes a home away from home after ushering the schoolbus through the village , he was on the phone to the supplier of eggs for the site canteen , complaining that they had got battery instead of free range .
part of the reason he has time to do these things is his new partnership with live music giant mean fiddler , who are in charge of the " nuts and bolts " of the festival - traffic , security , health and safety .
apprenticeship " all the stuff i did n't enjoy anyway , " eavis says .
he and mean fiddler managing director melvin benn have rekindled a working relationship that once saw benn serve his apprenticeship at glastonbury .
as long as the festival lives and breathes like it does at the moment , it will certainly continue michael eavis the pair are now " working quite well together " , eavis says .
" melvin 's in charge of the operational stuff , which frees me up to do all sorts of things that i enjoy doing .
melvin 's there with his shorts on now , wandering about everywhere with a radio in his hand . "
that has pleased the police , eavis says , who used to get frustrated that eavis rode around the site on his bicycle without so much as a mobile phone .
glastonbury continues to attract big names fans had been concerned that the mean fiddler involvement would destroy the festival 's fabled " hippy " spirit , and would mark the beginning of the end for the special atmosphere that other festivals seem unable to match .
safety fears but eavis is adamant that he is still in full control of the " artistic and emotive stuff " , whereas mean fiddler just " keep the wheels turning " .
safety fears pose the biggest threat to the festival 's future , prompting eavis to erect a £ 1m " super-fence " to keep thousands of gatecrashers out .
eavis is convinced that it will do its job , and that the festival will go on .
he certainly shows little desire to retire .
about 100,000 people are expected " as long as the festival lives and breathes like it does at the moment , it will certainly continue , " he says .
more exciting " it 's got so much energy to it , so much positive feeling about it , and everyone on board is throwing everything at it .
it 's so good . "
he says it is now more exciting than when he started in 1970 , because he can raise more money for charities like greenpeace , oxfam and water aid .
organisers have erected a new super fence to deter gate crashers " there are reasons to keep me motivated and happy and excited about it - and the reasons are that we can put so much back into our society , and even into countries around the world as well , " he says .
" that 's what makes it all worth doing .
it 's very satisfying for me to know that we can make a difference .
" not only for all the charitable stuff , but people that actually come here also feel like it 's been a really valuable experience for them .
that 's very , very gratifying for me to know that they enjoy it so much . "
' really magic ' he is still enthusiastic about the music , too , and the passion in his voice when he talks about radiohead 's 1997 headlining slot makes it clear that there is still fire in his belly .
" god , that was really magic , i 'll tell you , " he says in a hushed tone .
the festival has kept its unique spirit but there is one thing that would make him give up .
" it 's a balancing act between earning enough to make it work and keeping out the huge sponsorship deals that the other people seem to work with , " he says .
" it 's extraordinary when you get things like the vodafone derby - it 's absolutely extraordinary really , is n't it ?

the movie has already topped us box office charts and has its uk première in london on wednesday evening .
morton said the wealth of the production made working with a powerful director such as spielberg comparatively relaxed .
morton was nominated for an oscar for sweet and lowdown " on one level a film set is a film set but beyond that there is another magic that i had never experienced before , " said morton on tuesday in london .
" that magic is when people have the money to be free with what they want to do .

" steven is like an ' ambassador of emotion ' , " morton said .
" some people feel violated by that - i have friends who find it too much to watch a steven spielberg film .
