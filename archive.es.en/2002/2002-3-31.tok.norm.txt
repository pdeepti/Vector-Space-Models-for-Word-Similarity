she was so determined and so well loved . "
one tribute written on a card left on the green near the palace said : " i really do n't know what to say , our nation lost its grandmother today .
" through the blitz and bombing when things went wrong , you were the woman that made us strong .
rest peacefully , you deserve it . "
sombre mood john squire , 21 , and rachel ramshaw , 17 , on holiday from yorkshire , pause outside the palace gate .
" we did n't want to leave flowers but came to pay our respects , " rachel says .
" because we are young we did n't really know her , but like diana she seemed like a nice lady . "
londoners beverley bailey and tina zandona are among the first to lay flowers outside clarence house , where the queen mother lived nearby .
" we bought some flowers because they are bright and full of life - we thought that would be a nice way to remember her , " says ms zandona through tears .
touching her friend 's arm for support , ms bailey says that despite the queen mother 's recent illness , she was still surprised at the news .
" she was the pillar of the royal family - i thought she would go on forever . "
outside clarence house , workmen hastily erect barricades and a marquee in anticipation of the crowds to come over the following days .
the main entrance to the house itself is cordoned off , a move unpopular with mourner john lumsden , on holiday in london from the north of england .
tight security he says : " the metropolitan police did n't allow me to lay flowers at her front door , they would n't let me through .
" i had bought 12 beautiful red roses for a beautiful lady - a very special lady in many people 's hearts - and i am extremely upset about it .
" they told me i could n't come through because i could be a terrorist . "
instead , he lays his bouquet alongside about 30 others on a grass verge outside the walled grounds of the house .
most of the bouquets left in tribute are brightly-coloured carnations and chrysanthemums .
among the blooms in two of the bunches lie teddy bears in regimental uniforms .
one small bunch of carnations are tied to the lamp post outside the house , with a photo of a smiling queen mother stapled to the side .
another woman who comes to say goodbye lays a modest bunch of miniature roses .
" these were all i could get this late at night but it is the thought that counts .
bless her , " she says , crossing herself .
residents of windsor gathered outside the castle within minutes of learning of her death , laying bouquets at two separate entrances to the castle .
royalist terry hutt arrived at windsor castle less than an hour after the death was announced .
the 66-year-old slept on a bench beneath the castle 's ramparts on saturday night so he " could feel close " to the queen mother .
he first met her when he was just four years old , in london during the blitz , and travelled all over britain to see her whenever she made a public appearance .
" i feel so empty , i just do n't know what to say .
it 's like a friend has died , " he said .
" it is such a sad occasion .
she was a special , special lady . "
the atmosphere was sombre as people of all ages paid quiet tribute .
at the queen 's estate in sandringham , norfolk , several mourners visited to lay floral tributes outside the main gates .

activists of the bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- that leads india 's coalition government , joined supporters of other hardline hindu groups on the streets of jammu to enforce the strike .
groups like the vishwa hindu parishad -lrb- vhp -rrb- , bajraing dal and shiv sena have patrols out on city streets ensuring shops and other business establishments remain shut .
security forces are patrolling jammu 's muslim- majority districts to protect their residents from possible hindu backlash to saturday 's attack on the 150-year old raghunath temple .
two suspected militants and four temple guards died in the attack , as well as four civilians who were caught in the crossfire .
twenty others were wounded .
reports say five are in a critical condition .
no group has yet admitted responsibility for the apparent attempt to seize the temple , but police are blaming muslim militants .
the three attackers drove up to the site of the temple , in the residency road area , at 1030 local time -lrb- 0500gmt -rrb- when the area was crowded with people .
they threw grenades and opened fire with automatic weapons . "
we are keeping a special vigil in muslim areas because of the general strike called by these organisations " indian police spokesman one ran inside the temple , while another continued to fire from outside .
four armed guards returned fire and , in the one-hour gun battle which ensued , shot dead two of the attackers .
the third escaped in a jeep .
the bbc 's satish jacob says this is the first major incident to have occurred in the mainly hindu city of jammu .
hindu fears " we were on patrol duty when a militant fired on us as we alighted from our vehicle , " police officer nirmal prakash singh told reuters news agency .
" then he threw two grenades at us .
one of the grenades did not explode .
after this , we started firing back , " he said .
the attack is said to have sparked panic in the city and the atmosphere is reported to be tense .
hindus are reported to be fleeing jammu amid fears that the attack could provoke sectarian violence .
" we are not taking any chances .
we are setting up special checkpoints and we are bringing in police reinforcements to face any eventuality , " one official told the afp news agency .
rise in violence a local journalist has told the bbc that the pakistan-based group , lashkar e tayyaba , is suspected of being behind the attack .
police sources say there has been a sharp rise in the number of separatist attacks recently .
it is believed that , with a recent improvement in the weather , the separatists may have started crossing from pakistan into indian-controlled kashmir in large numbers .
at least 20 people , including five security personnel and nine militants , have been killed since thursday .
in one incident on friday , militants attacked a lorry carrying a group of paramilitary border security force , killing five people .
and at least two soldiers were killed in an early morning attack at a security force camp .
a number of islamic militant groups have been fighting for kashmir 's independence from india since 1989 .

the decision ends weeks of speculation about the future of the montagnard people , who fled vietnam 's central highlands a year ago following protests over land and religious rights .
the camps are run by cambodia with assistance from the united nations refugee agency , the unhcr , which will be involved in the resettlement programme .
cambodia wants refugee camps closed and warns that future illegal migrants will be arrested and deported .
history of emigration its government had been caught between its obligations under the convention on refugees and vietnam 's insistence on the return of people it calls illegal border crossers .
now , prime minister hun sen says cambodia wants to end the suffering of the montagnards in the camps by allowing them to be moved to a third country .
it is not the first time that montagnards have turned to america for shelter .
hanoi says the tribes people are hostile forces the fall of the central highlands was a turning point in the vietnam war .
thousands who had sided with the us fled the provincial capital of buon ma thuot and surrounding areas as communist forces bore down on saigon .
in the late 1980s , others migrated to the us under the orderly departure programme .
today , america has a large population of montagnards , particularly in the state of north carolina .
families may follow hanoi labels many of them hostile forces and says us-based separatists are trying to destabilise the highlands .
most of the people still in cambodia 's camps are men who have left families in vietnam .
some may yet choose to return home .
for those who do not , the us ambassador to cambodia , kent wiedeman , says america could consider applications for their families to join them .
if hanoi lets them go , that could swell the number of montagnards going to america to several thousand .
hanoi denies that vietnam discriminates against its ethnic minorities .
the communist authorities say observers are ignoring their efforts to reduce poverty and improve social conditions in the highlands .
but the un , diplomats and other independent observers have been prevented from verifying hanoi 's statements about its good intentions .

defence minister binyamin ben eliezer said the guerrillas could not have launched recent attacks on israel without the knowledge and approval of syria , which has a large military contingent in the country .
hezbollah fighters are reported to have fired mortars and rockets on at least three israeli positions in the disputed shebaa farms border area on saturday .
" we do not want to open a new front , we do not want an escalation but this operation could not have taken place without the knowledge and authorisation of syria , " mr ben eliezer said .
witnesses described heavy smoke rising from one israeli military post after the hezbollah attacks .
israeli jets responded by firing several air-to-surface missiles and israeli artillery reportedly shelled the outskirts of hasbaya , a town on the lebanese side of the border .
there were no reports of casualties .
flashpoint it was the first israeli raid on southern lebanon since late january .
a hezbollah statement said the guerrilla attacks were part of the organisation 's campaign to " liberate " the area from israeli control .
an israeli army spokesman said it was a deliberate attempt to escalate the conflict .
" hezbollah wishes in a crude and violent fashion to heat up the area and provoke israel , " said lieutenant colonel olivier rafowicz .
the shebaa farms have been a flashpoint since israel pulled out of lebanon in may 2000 .
israel seized the farms in 1967 from syria , but lebanon claims the area as its territory .
