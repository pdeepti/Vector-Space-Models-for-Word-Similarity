in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.12.2002 giving till it hurts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans hate taxes , but they love the " tax song " germany 's complex tax system has long been a bone of contention for individuals and businesses alike .
the latest proposal to reintroduce the wealth tax has ignited a storm of protest . if it were n't for the " tax song , " germans would have nothing to smile about at all in these days of economic doom and gloom .
the brilliant parody of the " ketchup song " which targets chancellor gerhard schröder 's tax policies is probably the least of his worries at the moment .
with the country already straining under one of europe 's highest tax burdens - counting all direct and indirect taxes and levies it stands at 56 percent on national income - social democratic-led states are proposing the introduction of yet another tax .
more costs the wealth tax initiative , these states say , would generate around € 20 billion -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
the 1 percent tax would be levied on companies whose assets exceed € 2.5 million and on individuals who own more than € 1 million in property , cash and investments .
however , detractors say the wealth tax will create more problems than it solves .
" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .
for example the relatively high taxation of labor compared with capital income tax is cited as a reason for the lack of job creation in germany .
overhaul with bankruptcies reaching a record high in germany this year , businesses are calling for more flexibility on the labor market and above all no more tax increases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there must be more equality in the tax system , " said herman franzen , the president of the german retailers association . "
" the tax burden must be reduced to below 40 percent and we need a radical overhaul of the whole taxation system , " he added . rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international business community criticizes german tax plan the german government ’ s decision to raise taxes has been sharply criticized by both national and international businesses .

in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .
a government spokesman said it was expected that struck would announce his plans at this week 's cabinet meeting before going public with them on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting germany 's armed forces in private hands faced with sinking funding and increasing demands , germany 's armed forces are turning to the private sector for a bailout .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.12.2002 giving till it hurts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans hate taxes , but they love the " tax song " germany 's complex tax system has long been a bone of contention for individuals and businesses alike .
the latest proposal to reintroduce the wealth tax has ignited a storm of protest . if it were n't for the " tax song , " germans would have nothing to smile about at all in these days of economic doom and gloom .
the brilliant parody of the " ketchup song " which targets chancellor gerhard schröder 's tax policies is probably the least of his worries at the moment .
with the country already straining under one of europe 's highest tax burdens - counting all direct and indirect taxes and levies it stands at 56 percent on national income - social democratic-led states are proposing the introduction of yet another tax .
more costs the wealth tax initiative , these states say , would generate around € 20 billion -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
the 1 percent tax would be levied on companies whose assets exceed € 2.5 million and on individuals who own more than € 1 million in property , cash and investments .
however , detractors say the wealth tax will create more problems than it solves .
" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .
for example the relatively high taxation of labor compared with capital income tax is cited as a reason for the lack of job creation in germany .
overhaul with bankruptcies reaching a record high in germany this year , businesses are calling for more flexibility on the labor market and above all no more tax increases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there must be more equality in the tax system , " said herman franzen , the president of the german retailers association . "
" the tax burden must be reduced to below 40 percent and we need a radical overhaul of the whole taxation system , " he added . rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international business community criticizes german tax plan the german government ’ s decision to raise taxes has been sharply criticized by both national and international businesses .

the latest proposal to reintroduce the wealth tax has ignited a storm of protest . if it were n't for the " tax song , " germans would have nothing to smile about at all in these days of economic doom and gloom .
the brilliant parody of the " ketchup song " which targets chancellor gerhard schröder 's tax policies is probably the least of his worries at the moment .
with the country already straining under one of europe 's highest tax burdens - counting all direct and indirect taxes and levies it stands at 56 percent on national income - social democratic-led states are proposing the introduction of yet another tax .
more costs the wealth tax initiative , these states say , would generate around € 20 billion -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
the 1 percent tax would be levied on companies whose assets exceed € 2.5 million and on individuals who own more than € 1 million in property , cash and investments .
however , detractors say the wealth tax will create more problems than it solves .
" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .
for example the relatively high taxation of labor compared with capital income tax is cited as a reason for the lack of job creation in germany .
overhaul with bankruptcies reaching a record high in germany this year , businesses are calling for more flexibility on the labor market and above all no more tax increases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there must be more equality in the tax system , " said herman franzen , the president of the german retailers association . "
" the tax burden must be reduced to below 40 percent and we need a radical overhaul of the whole taxation system , " he added . rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international business community criticizes german tax plan the german government ’ s decision to raise taxes has been sharply criticized by both national and international businesses .

in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .
a government spokesman said it was expected that struck would announce his plans at this week 's cabinet meeting before going public with them on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting germany 's armed forces in private hands faced with sinking funding and increasing demands , germany 's armed forces are turning to the private sector for a bailout .

the latest proposal to reintroduce the wealth tax has ignited a storm of protest . if it were n't for the " tax song , " germans would have nothing to smile about at all in these days of economic doom and gloom .
the brilliant parody of the " ketchup song " which targets chancellor gerhard schröder 's tax policies is probably the least of his worries at the moment .
with the country already straining under one of europe 's highest tax burdens - counting all direct and indirect taxes and levies it stands at 56 percent on national income - social democratic-led states are proposing the introduction of yet another tax .
more costs the wealth tax initiative , these states say , would generate around € 20 billion -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
the 1 percent tax would be levied on companies whose assets exceed € 2.5 million and on individuals who own more than € 1 million in property , cash and investments .
however , detractors say the wealth tax will create more problems than it solves .
" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .
for example the relatively high taxation of labor compared with capital income tax is cited as a reason for the lack of job creation in germany .
overhaul with bankruptcies reaching a record high in germany this year , businesses are calling for more flexibility on the labor market and above all no more tax increases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there must be more equality in the tax system , " said herman franzen , the president of the german retailers association . "
" the tax burden must be reduced to below 40 percent and we need a radical overhaul of the whole taxation system , " he added . rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international business community criticizes german tax plan the german government ’ s decision to raise taxes has been sharply criticized by both national and international businesses .

the latest proposal to reintroduce the wealth tax has ignited a storm of protest . if it were n't for the " tax song , " germans would have nothing to smile about at all in these days of economic doom and gloom .
the brilliant parody of the " ketchup song " which targets chancellor gerhard schröder 's tax policies is probably the least of his worries at the moment .
with the country already straining under one of europe 's highest tax burdens - counting all direct and indirect taxes and levies it stands at 56 percent on national income - social democratic-led states are proposing the introduction of yet another tax .
more costs the wealth tax initiative , these states say , would generate around € 20 billion -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
the 1 percent tax would be levied on companies whose assets exceed € 2.5 million and on individuals who own more than € 1 million in property , cash and investments .
however , detractors say the wealth tax will create more problems than it solves .
" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .
for example the relatively high taxation of labor compared with capital income tax is cited as a reason for the lack of job creation in germany .

in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .

businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .

in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .

with the country already straining under one of europe 's highest tax burdens - counting all direct and indirect taxes and levies it stands at 56 percent on national income - social democratic-led states are proposing the introduction of yet another tax .
more costs the wealth tax initiative , these states say , would generate around € 20 billion -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
the 1 percent tax would be levied on companies whose assets exceed € 2.5 million and on individuals who own more than € 1 million in property , cash and investments .
however , detractors say the wealth tax will create more problems than it solves .
" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .
for example the relatively high taxation of labor compared with capital income tax is cited as a reason for the lack of job creation in germany .

in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .
a government spokesman said it was expected that struck would announce his plans at this week 's cabinet meeting before going public with them on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting germany 's armed forces in private hands faced with sinking funding and increasing demands , germany 's armed forces are turning to the private sector for a bailout .

in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.12.2002 giving till it hurts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans hate taxes , but they love the " tax song " germany 's complex tax system has long been a bone of contention for individuals and businesses alike .
the latest proposal to reintroduce the wealth tax has ignited a storm of protest . if it were n't for the " tax song , " germans would have nothing to smile about at all in these days of economic doom and gloom .
the brilliant parody of the " ketchup song " which targets chancellor gerhard schröder 's tax policies is probably the least of his worries at the moment .
with the country already straining under one of europe 's highest tax burdens - counting all direct and indirect taxes and levies it stands at 56 percent on national income - social democratic-led states are proposing the introduction of yet another tax .
more costs the wealth tax initiative , these states say , would generate around € 20 billion -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
the 1 percent tax would be levied on companies whose assets exceed € 2.5 million and on individuals who own more than € 1 million in property , cash and investments .
however , detractors say the wealth tax will create more problems than it solves .
" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .
for example the relatively high taxation of labor compared with capital income tax is cited as a reason for the lack of job creation in germany .
overhaul with bankruptcies reaching a record high in germany this year , businesses are calling for more flexibility on the labor market and above all no more tax increases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there must be more equality in the tax system , " said herman franzen , the president of the german retailers association . "
" the tax burden must be reduced to below 40 percent and we need a radical overhaul of the whole taxation system , " he added . rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international business community criticizes german tax plan the german government ’ s decision to raise taxes has been sharply criticized by both national and international businesses .

in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .
a government spokesman said it was expected that struck would announce his plans at this week 's cabinet meeting before going public with them on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting germany 's armed forces in private hands faced with sinking funding and increasing demands , germany 's armed forces are turning to the private sector for a bailout .
but help wo n't arrive that quickly .

the latest proposal to reintroduce the wealth tax has ignited a storm of protest . if it were n't for the " tax song , " germans would have nothing to smile about at all in these days of economic doom and gloom .
the brilliant parody of the " ketchup song " which targets chancellor gerhard schröder 's tax policies is probably the least of his worries at the moment .
with the country already straining under one of europe 's highest tax burdens - counting all direct and indirect taxes and levies it stands at 56 percent on national income - social democratic-led states are proposing the introduction of yet another tax .
more costs the wealth tax initiative , these states say , would generate around € 20 billion -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
the 1 percent tax would be levied on companies whose assets exceed € 2.5 million and on individuals who own more than € 1 million in property , cash and investments .
however , detractors say the wealth tax will create more problems than it solves .
" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .
for example the relatively high taxation of labor compared with capital income tax is cited as a reason for the lack of job creation in germany .
overhaul with bankruptcies reaching a record high in germany this year , businesses are calling for more flexibility on the labor market and above all no more tax increases .

" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .
for example the relatively high taxation of labor compared with capital income tax is cited as a reason for the lack of job creation in germany .

in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .

in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .
a government spokesman said it was expected that struck would announce his plans at this week 's cabinet meeting before going public with them on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting germany 's armed forces in private hands faced with sinking funding and increasing demands , germany 's armed forces are turning to the private sector for a bailout .

the latest proposal to reintroduce the wealth tax has ignited a storm of protest . if it were n't for the " tax song , " germans would have nothing to smile about at all in these days of economic doom and gloom .
the brilliant parody of the " ketchup song " which targets chancellor gerhard schröder 's tax policies is probably the least of his worries at the moment .
with the country already straining under one of europe 's highest tax burdens - counting all direct and indirect taxes and levies it stands at 56 percent on national income - social democratic-led states are proposing the introduction of yet another tax .
more costs the wealth tax initiative , these states say , would generate around € 20 billion -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
the 1 percent tax would be levied on companies whose assets exceed € 2.5 million and on individuals who own more than € 1 million in property , cash and investments .
however , detractors say the wealth tax will create more problems than it solves .
" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .
for example the relatively high taxation of labor compared with capital income tax is cited as a reason for the lack of job creation in germany .
overhaul with bankruptcies reaching a record high in germany this year , businesses are calling for more flexibility on the labor market and above all no more tax increases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there must be more equality in the tax system , " said herman franzen , the president of the german retailers association . "
" the tax burden must be reduced to below 40 percent and we need a radical overhaul of the whole taxation system , " he added . rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international business community criticizes german tax plan the german government ’ s decision to raise taxes has been sharply criticized by both national and international businesses .

the latest proposal to reintroduce the wealth tax has ignited a storm of protest . if it were n't for the " tax song , " germans would have nothing to smile about at all in these days of economic doom and gloom .
the brilliant parody of the " ketchup song " which targets chancellor gerhard schröder 's tax policies is probably the least of his worries at the moment .
with the country already straining under one of europe 's highest tax burdens - counting all direct and indirect taxes and levies it stands at 56 percent on national income - social democratic-led states are proposing the introduction of yet another tax .
more costs the wealth tax initiative , these states say , would generate around € 20 billion -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
the 1 percent tax would be levied on companies whose assets exceed € 2.5 million and on individuals who own more than € 1 million in property , cash and investments .
however , detractors say the wealth tax will create more problems than it solves .
" the costs and bureaucracy involved will far exceed the expected revenue gain , " professor winfried fuest , tax expert with the institute for business research in cologne told dw-world .
" as the tax has n't been in place since 1997 , you would have to reassess at least one million businesses and individuals , " he said .
constitutional problems the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principal that the state must not take more than half of any citizen 's income .
professor fuest says there are other problems , too .
" constitutionally , the tax should only apply to assets that are sold by businesses and not to those they hold . "
for medium-sized businesses - which form the backbone of germany 's economy - who are already suffering from the stifling array of taxes , the wealth tax creates an additional burden .
" the majority of medium-sized businesses in germany has a thin capitalization of around 7 percent on average , so paying a wealth tax on top of their other taxes is going to hurt them even more , " said fuest .
businesses set to leave fuest thinks the threat by many businesses to leave germany in light of the increasing tax burden could become reality sooner rather than later .
" there are many ways for these companies to relocate their capital , be it through offshore organizations or moving their assets to tax-free havens , " fuest said .
while social democratic state premiers like sigmar gabriel of lower saxony argue that the additional revenue would go toward boosting the education budget , critics such as professor fuest say this is nonsense as german tax law does not allow for special provisions on how tax revenues are to be allocated .
instead , the generated income is thrown into one big pot and then apportioned among the federal government , state governments and municipalities .
too many taxes a look at germany 's convoluted revenue-sharing taxation system shows that there are around 30 different types of taxes , the most important of these are federal taxes such as personal income tax laws , corporate income tax laws and value-added tax laws .
many analysts say the laws are misguided and are stifling economic recovery .

in a reform of a reform , defense minister peter struck aims to slash up to € 6 billion in military spending . the german military is chronically underfinanced .
now defense minister peter struck wants to cut € 6 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- by 2006 .
struck is expected to announce the details this week .
meanwhile , the german press has already been reporting on the extent of the reductions . the idea is to cut down on numbers without reducing effectiveness or hindering efforts to modernize the armed forces .
it 's not a new idea .
plans by struck 's predecessor , rudolf scharping , to reform the german military were passed by parliament in 1999 . but now struck has commissioned bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan to re-examine military spending projects .
the armed forces has a budget of € 23.7 billion , plus an additional € 767 million for fighting terrorism .
in coming years the military will have to make do with € 24.4 billion - too little for big new projects .
former defense minister scharping 's plans , however , would require € 10 billion more than the government has allotted the military for the next 10 years . no troop reductions schneiderhan handed in his report to struck on friday .
until a decision is finally made whether to end mandatory conscription troop reductions wo n't be made .
the forces will retain 282,000 soldiers -lrb- currently 300,000 -rrb- and money will be saved mainly on reducing acquisitions . structural changes will focus largely on the army .
there will be fewer armed troops and more emphasis on transport , logistics and leadership to take into account the current tendency towards numerous smaller operations taking place at the same time . in the past , the german armed forces were equipped to deal with two mid-sized operations at once . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus perhaps the most sensitive of the proposals will be sizable reductions in orders for airbus a400m military transport aircraft .
germany had already ordered 73 a400ms , but will likely reduce the number to 60 .
earlier this year , the german parliament approved buying 40 of the airbus planes , a move that upset britain and france .
defense ministers from both countries warned that the reduced acquisition would harm the development of a european military rapid reaction force . further cuts involve acquiring 80 tiger helicopters instead of 212 ; the decommissioning of tornado fighter jets ; meteor and iris-t rockets used to arm eurofighters jets will be reduced ; only half of the 200 tornado fighter planes will be modernized ; the air force will phase out hawk air defense missiles and uh-1d helicopters earlier than planned ; the marines will retire nearly a dozen fast boots and receive fewer frigates , corvettes and submarines than bundeswehr reform originally called for .
a government spokesman said it was expected that struck would announce his plans at this week 's cabinet meeting before going public with them on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting germany 's armed forces in private hands faced with sinking funding and increasing demands , germany 's armed forces are turning to the private sector for a bailout .

bp chief executive lord browne told a parliamentary committee he had ordered directors to bypass middle management , the financial times reported .
instead , he told them to go straight to junior managers at bp 's grass roots to discover the true state of the organisation .
lord browne said the inquiry was held to " make sure information is absolutely pure and not in any way distorted by trying to put things in a favourable light " .
disappointment in city bp 's third adjustment to its full-year 2002 oil and gas output forecast pushed its shares down more than 7 % to close below £ 4 for the first time in four years in when it was released in october .
bp said in october it expected output to grow by 3 % this year , compared to a 5.5 % target in august .
alongside lowered output targets , bp unveiled a 13 % drop in profits for the three months from july to september .
bp , the world 's second biggest energy firm , disappointed the city of london with net profits of about $ 3bn -lrb- £ 2bn -rrb- - well below analysts ' expectations .
' disenfranchised ' lord browne , who was addressing a parliamentary committee investigating the uk government 's use of target-setting , said bp 's unit managers were asked to sign a pledge that information was accurate .
" it is important that they stand there and say , ' this is my opinion and no one else 's ' , " he said .
he said the decision to go " right to the bottom of the organisation " to find out what went wrong had left some managers higher up " feeling very disenfranchised " .
