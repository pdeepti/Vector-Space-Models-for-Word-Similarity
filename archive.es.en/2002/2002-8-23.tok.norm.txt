program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.08.2002 rethinking germany ’ s rivers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working to keep the waters back in the wake of central europe ’ s devastating floods , politicians in germany are reconsidering the country ’ s policies toward its rivers . as german politicians struggle to come up with the billions of euros needed to rebuild after the worst floods of the century , some prominent voices are calling for a new strategy regarding development along the nation ’ s rivers .
current policies of construction along river banks and in flood plains are now being questioned and environmentalists charge such practices are largely responsible for the severity of the recent floods . “ if we don ’ t change the way we deal with our rivers , we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century ’ , ” said steffi lemke , parliamentary leader of the green party . such talk is finding increasing resonance in germany , as people and politicians survey the vast swathes of land that have been laid waste in parts of eastern and northern germany after the elbe and danube rivers , along with their tributaries , jumped their banks in the wake of torrential rains over central europe . the flood surge in the elbe moved down the river from the czech republic with destructive force , inundating germany ’ s eastern jewel , dresden , then drowning town after town on its way downstream .
despite early warnings and massive efforts to erect dykes and other defenses , the raging water could not be contained . now in the flood ’ s aftermath , the question is : how can we prevent this from happening again ? river conference on wednesday , kurt bodewig , federal minister of transport , building and housing , called for a national conference involving the states , muncipalities and various associations to discuss the future of germany ’ s rivers .
the goal , according to a ministry spokesman , is to come up with a master plan for flood protection .
no date has yet been set . environmentalists have been vocal in their criticism of germany 's current river policies , blaming the severity of the floods on what they see as a misguided policy of constricting rivers with levees and locks and turning them into “ superhighways ” for barge transport . they note that the elbe river is 100 kilometers shorter than it was 150 years ago and that it has lost some 85 % of the forests that once lay in its flood plains .
as a result , the speed of the river has quadrupled , according to the german environmental group bund . “ we demand that both chancellor gerhard schröder and candidate edmund stoiber make this a priority and stop further development along the donau and elbe .
that -lrb- development -rrb- is the cause of the catastrophe that we ’ re dealing with today , ” said gerhard timm , an official with bund .
“ preventive flood protection means giving the rivers room to breathe . ” environmentalists want to use one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- planned for river development on moving the levees back and establishing flood plains that could accept overflows from swollen rivers , slowing them down and preventing widespread flooding in built-up areas . the demands are not falling on deaf ears .
in a cabinet meeting this week , chancellor schröder said a reconsideration of development plans for the elbe river was “ sensible and necessary ” even as his social democrats rejected overall criticism of its elbe policy .
a spokesman from the transport ministry said the government has no plans to enlarge development along the river nor introduce more constricting locks . michael müller , parliamentary flood leader for the spd , could have been reading off a page ripped form an environmentalist handbook when he called it dangerous for people “ when the rivers are deepened , built up , and straightened , or when the flood plains disappear . “ looking at holland past attempts to change river policy in germany have mostly met with failure or lack of interest .
after huge floods on the oder river in 1997 , then chancellor helmut kohl appealed for new measures to ease pressure on the waterway .
in the end , nothing came of it . this time however , the sheer level of devastation could move the german government to act .
it has begun looking at its neighbor , the netherlands , which changed its policies on rivers after floods on the rhine river seven years ago .
the dutch government came up with a new concept to return the river to its original bed .
it moved the levees back some 200 meters and specified certains areas that could be flooded if necessary to relieve pressure on the river . german thinking could be moving in that direction . “ we need to build with the river , “ said transportation minister bodewig , “ not against the current . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fleeing an angry river one of thousands of evacuees in dresden last week , frank jesuiter 's concern was especially acute .
the social worker had to make sure the 64 handicapped and elderly residents he cared for were brought out safely .
dresden under water record floods in the east german cultural capital of dresden peaked at dawn on saturday .
the historic inner city is flooded - including architectural landmarks like the zwinger palace and the semper opera .

polls consistently put him ahead of both stoiber and his own spd party comrades . his sharp suits , charm and ability to enjoy a good beer and mix it up with his citizens have earned him the nickname , the “ media chancellor ” . it is that image stoiber and his advisors have been trying to use against schröder since campaigning began in late winter .
the advertising billboards of the christian democratic union and stoiber ’ s christian social union present a candidate who is “ exact and squared , ” the total opposite of the slick , too-fast image stoiber advisers say schröder exudes . psychologists and media experts say this sunday ’ s appearance will be crucial for both candidates in reaching the roughly 30 percent of the population still undecided on how they will vote on sept .
22 . ” the first impression is decisive , ” said media psychologist siegfried frey in a recent interview with the magazine " psychologie heute " .
“ we immediately have an opinion of a person and evaluate such complex characteristics as competence , underhanded-ness , tolerance and ambition . ” gathering for the candidates ' debates those are crucial factors campaign strategists in the united states have long known about .
the first tv debate took place between incumbent vice president richard nixon and democratic challenger john f. kennedy in 1960 .
kennedy , tanned and confident , shut down the favored , but haggard-looking nixon and went on to win the election . since then , seven pairs of u.s. presidential hopefuls have duelled before massive national television audiences .
the 2000 campaign featured three televised debates , with texas governor george w. bush winning the upper hand in the final two . the format is entirely new to germany .
former chancellor helmut kohl ruled western germany and the reunified germany from 1982 until 1998 and never felt the need to do much campaigning , much less live debating when re-election time came around . but the emergence of the media-savvy schröder , who went on to unseat kohl changed all that . both candidates have outfitted themselves with experienced media advisors who to a large extent have shaped the image the two present to voters . the move has benefited stoiber , who became the butt of many jokes following his stuttering , awkward first appearance on national tv talk show in january .
analysts are n't expecting a repeat performance this sunday .
stoiber has already become smoother in live appearances . but whether he can out-media the media chancellor remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

current policies of construction along river banks and in flood plains are now being questioned and environmentalists charge such practices are largely responsible for the severity of the recent floods . “ if we don ’ t change the way we deal with our rivers , we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century ’ , ” said steffi lemke , parliamentary leader of the green party . such talk is finding increasing resonance in germany , as people and politicians survey the vast swathes of land that have been laid waste in parts of eastern and northern germany after the elbe and danube rivers , along with their tributaries , jumped their banks in the wake of torrential rains over central europe . the flood surge in the elbe moved down the river from the czech republic with destructive force , inundating germany ’ s eastern jewel , dresden , then drowning town after town on its way downstream .

in a cabinet meeting this week , chancellor schröder said a reconsideration of development plans for the elbe river was “ sensible and necessary ” even as his social democrats rejected overall criticism of its elbe policy .
a spokesman from the transport ministry said the government has no plans to enlarge development along the river nor introduce more constricting locks . michael müller , parliamentary flood leader for the spd , could have been reading off a page ripped form an environmentalist handbook when he called it dangerous for people “ when the rivers are deepened , built up , and straightened , or when the flood plains disappear . “ looking at holland past attempts to change river policy in germany have mostly met with failure or lack of interest .

for both candidates there is much to win - and lose . this sunday , millions of germans will gather around their tv sets for the first time for an event that has long become old hat in the united states : the candidates ' debates . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is more popular than his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will go up against his conservative challenger for the chancellor ’ s seat , edmund stoiber , the successful premier of the state of bavaria . for stoiber , the debate offers an opportunity to rebuild the lead he has held in the polls over schröder for the past nine months but lost this week . for schröder , sunday ’ s televised duel , the first of two , will offer the opportunity to display his superior media charm in order to scrap together badly needed votes that will win him a second four-year term in the chancellery . analysts had been predicting that the debate would be the last chance for schröder and his social democrats , who have suffered in polls as a result of a germany ’ s slumping economy and high unemployment rate . but a poll released friday put schröder ’ s spd ahead of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union / christian social union bloc for the first time in months , something analysts attribute to schröder ’ s leadership during the floods that savaged germany last week . now , schröder advisors want the chancellor to have the last say and scrap an agreed-on coin flip before the debate to decide who would answer first and second .
the proposal is opposed by stoiber 's camp and both sides are still working on a solution . a chance for the media chancellor to shine schröder , whose governing style awakens memories of former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair , is widely considered the more popular of the two candidates .
polls consistently put him ahead of both stoiber and his own spd party comrades . his sharp suits , charm and ability to enjoy a good beer and mix it up with his citizens have earned him the nickname , the “ media chancellor ” . it is that image stoiber and his advisors have been trying to use against schröder since campaigning began in late winter .
the advertising billboards of the christian democratic union and stoiber ’ s christian social union present a candidate who is “ exact and squared , ” the total opposite of the slick , too-fast image stoiber advisers say schröder exudes . psychologists and media experts say this sunday ’ s appearance will be crucial for both candidates in reaching the roughly 30 percent of the population still undecided on how they will vote on sept .
22 . ” the first impression is decisive , ” said media psychologist siegfried frey in a recent interview with the magazine " psychologie heute " .
“ we immediately have an opinion of a person and evaluate such complex characteristics as competence , underhanded-ness , tolerance and ambition . ” gathering for the candidates ' debates those are crucial factors campaign strategists in the united states have long known about .
the first tv debate took place between incumbent vice president richard nixon and democratic challenger john f. kennedy in 1960 .
kennedy , tanned and confident , shut down the favored , but haggard-looking nixon and went on to win the election . since then , seven pairs of u.s. presidential hopefuls have duelled before massive national television audiences .
the 2000 campaign featured three televised debates , with texas governor george w. bush winning the upper hand in the final two . the format is entirely new to germany .

for both candidates there is much to win - and lose . this sunday , millions of germans will gather around their tv sets for the first time for an event that has long become old hat in the united states : the candidates ' debates . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is more popular than his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will go up against his conservative challenger for the chancellor ’ s seat , edmund stoiber , the successful premier of the state of bavaria . for stoiber , the debate offers an opportunity to rebuild the lead he has held in the polls over schröder for the past nine months but lost this week . for schröder , sunday ’ s televised duel , the first of two , will offer the opportunity to display his superior media charm in order to scrap together badly needed votes that will win him a second four-year term in the chancellery . analysts had been predicting that the debate would be the last chance for schröder and his social democrats , who have suffered in polls as a result of a germany ’ s slumping economy and high unemployment rate . but a poll released friday put schröder ’ s spd ahead of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union / christian social union bloc for the first time in months , something analysts attribute to schröder ’ s leadership during the floods that savaged germany last week . now , schröder advisors want the chancellor to have the last say and scrap an agreed-on coin flip before the debate to decide who would answer first and second .
the proposal is opposed by stoiber 's camp and both sides are still working on a solution . a chance for the media chancellor to shine schröder , whose governing style awakens memories of former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair , is widely considered the more popular of the two candidates .
polls consistently put him ahead of both stoiber and his own spd party comrades . his sharp suits , charm and ability to enjoy a good beer and mix it up with his citizens have earned him the nickname , the “ media chancellor ” . it is that image stoiber and his advisors have been trying to use against schröder since campaigning began in late winter .

the first tv debate took place between incumbent vice president richard nixon and democratic challenger john f. kennedy in 1960 .
kennedy , tanned and confident , shut down the favored , but haggard-looking nixon and went on to win the election . since then , seven pairs of u.s. presidential hopefuls have duelled before massive national television audiences .

former chancellor helmut kohl ruled western germany and the reunified germany from 1982 until 1998 and never felt the need to do much campaigning , much less live debating when re-election time came around . but the emergence of the media-savvy schröder , who went on to unseat kohl changed all that . both candidates have outfitted themselves with experienced media advisors who to a large extent have shaped the image the two present to voters . the move has benefited stoiber , who became the butt of many jokes following his stuttering , awkward first appearance on national tv talk show in january .

current policies of construction along river banks and in flood plains are now being questioned and environmentalists charge such practices are largely responsible for the severity of the recent floods . “ if we don ’ t change the way we deal with our rivers , we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century ’ , ” said steffi lemke , parliamentary leader of the green party . such talk is finding increasing resonance in germany , as people and politicians survey the vast swathes of land that have been laid waste in parts of eastern and northern germany after the elbe and danube rivers , along with their tributaries , jumped their banks in the wake of torrential rains over central europe . the flood surge in the elbe moved down the river from the czech republic with destructive force , inundating germany ’ s eastern jewel , dresden , then drowning town after town on its way downstream .

“ preventive flood protection means giving the rivers room to breathe . ” environmentalists want to use one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- planned for river development on moving the levees back and establishing flood plains that could accept overflows from swollen rivers , slowing them down and preventing widespread flooding in built-up areas . the demands are not falling on deaf ears .
in a cabinet meeting this week , chancellor schröder said a reconsideration of development plans for the elbe river was “ sensible and necessary ” even as his social democrats rejected overall criticism of its elbe policy .
a spokesman from the transport ministry said the government has no plans to enlarge development along the river nor introduce more constricting locks . michael müller , parliamentary flood leader for the spd , could have been reading off a page ripped form an environmentalist handbook when he called it dangerous for people “ when the rivers are deepened , built up , and straightened , or when the flood plains disappear . “ looking at holland past attempts to change river policy in germany have mostly met with failure or lack of interest .
after huge floods on the oder river in 1997 , then chancellor helmut kohl appealed for new measures to ease pressure on the waterway .
in the end , nothing came of it . this time however , the sheer level of devastation could move the german government to act .
it has begun looking at its neighbor , the netherlands , which changed its policies on rivers after floods on the rhine river seven years ago .
the dutch government came up with a new concept to return the river to its original bed .
it moved the levees back some 200 meters and specified certains areas that could be flooded if necessary to relieve pressure on the river . german thinking could be moving in that direction . “ we need to build with the river , “ said transportation minister bodewig , “ not against the current . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fleeing an angry river one of thousands of evacuees in dresden last week , frank jesuiter 's concern was especially acute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.08.2002 germans to tune in for first candidate debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kickoff millions of germans will tune into the country 's first-ever televised debate between chancellor candidates this sunday .
for both candidates there is much to win - and lose . this sunday , millions of germans will gather around their tv sets for the first time for an event that has long become old hat in the united states : the candidates ' debates . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is more popular than his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will go up against his conservative challenger for the chancellor ’ s seat , edmund stoiber , the successful premier of the state of bavaria . for stoiber , the debate offers an opportunity to rebuild the lead he has held in the polls over schröder for the past nine months but lost this week . for schröder , sunday ’ s televised duel , the first of two , will offer the opportunity to display his superior media charm in order to scrap together badly needed votes that will win him a second four-year term in the chancellery . analysts had been predicting that the debate would be the last chance for schröder and his social democrats , who have suffered in polls as a result of a germany ’ s slumping economy and high unemployment rate . but a poll released friday put schröder ’ s spd ahead of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union / christian social union bloc for the first time in months , something analysts attribute to schröder ’ s leadership during the floods that savaged germany last week . now , schröder advisors want the chancellor to have the last say and scrap an agreed-on coin flip before the debate to decide who would answer first and second .
the proposal is opposed by stoiber 's camp and both sides are still working on a solution . a chance for the media chancellor to shine schröder , whose governing style awakens memories of former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair , is widely considered the more popular of the two candidates .
polls consistently put him ahead of both stoiber and his own spd party comrades . his sharp suits , charm and ability to enjoy a good beer and mix it up with his citizens have earned him the nickname , the “ media chancellor ” . it is that image stoiber and his advisors have been trying to use against schröder since campaigning began in late winter .
the advertising billboards of the christian democratic union and stoiber ’ s christian social union present a candidate who is “ exact and squared , ” the total opposite of the slick , too-fast image stoiber advisers say schröder exudes . psychologists and media experts say this sunday ’ s appearance will be crucial for both candidates in reaching the roughly 30 percent of the population still undecided on how they will vote on sept .
22 . ” the first impression is decisive , ” said media psychologist siegfried frey in a recent interview with the magazine " psychologie heute " .
“ we immediately have an opinion of a person and evaluate such complex characteristics as competence , underhanded-ness , tolerance and ambition . ” gathering for the candidates ' debates those are crucial factors campaign strategists in the united states have long known about .
the first tv debate took place between incumbent vice president richard nixon and democratic challenger john f. kennedy in 1960 .
kennedy , tanned and confident , shut down the favored , but haggard-looking nixon and went on to win the election . since then , seven pairs of u.s. presidential hopefuls have duelled before massive national television audiences .
the 2000 campaign featured three televised debates , with texas governor george w. bush winning the upper hand in the final two . the format is entirely new to germany .
former chancellor helmut kohl ruled western germany and the reunified germany from 1982 until 1998 and never felt the need to do much campaigning , much less live debating when re-election time came around . but the emergence of the media-savvy schröder , who went on to unseat kohl changed all that . both candidates have outfitted themselves with experienced media advisors who to a large extent have shaped the image the two present to voters . the move has benefited stoiber , who became the butt of many jokes following his stuttering , awkward first appearance on national tv talk show in january .
analysts are n't expecting a repeat performance this sunday .
stoiber has already become smoother in live appearances . but whether he can out-media the media chancellor remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

and with water levels rising farther north , there may be more damage to come . north of the city of dresden , one of the regions hardest hit by last week ’ s devastating flood waters , people are bracing themselves for the surging waters of the river elbe , which are slowly moving upstream . further south , in saxony , saxony-anhalt and brandenburg , repair work has begun .
in berlin , the german government has put the cost of repair damage at some 15 billion euro .
but in wide areas of german infrastructure the exact costs are still largely unknown . according to deutsche bahn spokesman achim stauss , “ it will take weeks before the exact dimension of the damage done is known ” .
but what is clear is that repairs will cost billions - with the only question being whether they will be in the single or double digits . germany ’ s rail network has been particularly hard hit by the recent floods , which destroyed the livelihoods of millions of central europeans last week .
rail lines , roads and bridges were simply washed away in the surging torrents .
and as the swollen waters of the river elbe continue to rise farther up north , so too could the costs of damage to germany ’ s national rail network , according to another deutsche bahn spokesman , hans-georg kusznir . deutsche bahn has now organised a crisis centre in dresden to estimate the precise scope of the damage . according to stauss , “ the worst damage has been done in saxony . ”
dresden , at the heart of saxony , is a crucial link in the central german railway network .
“ our main aim is to repair the main rail lines , in order to get the central german region back on track ” , the company said in a statement . the company 's highest priority is to repair the dresden-leipzig-chemnitz connection , a heavily frequented line in a highly industrial region in germany ’ s east . financing still unclear “ details on the financing of this work will have to be solved later ” , kusznir said .
however , funds for immediate repair have already been made available .
“ for the year 2002 the bahn has around 2.5 billion euro for investments in the current network , ” he said . deutsche bahn will make the flooded regions a priority in the distribution of these funds , he said . fears that planned projects , such as the modernisation of dresden ’ s 100-year-old station , will be neglected due to flood repairs , have been denied by deutsche bahn .
but some projects will inevitably have to be postponed . additionally , the german government has promised to help deutsche bahn where it can .
“ we will help the company ” , transport minister kurt bodewig , a social democrat , pledged on tuesday .
the government has already planned a record sum for the rail company in this year ’ s budget .
bodewig said one billion euro had been designated for the bahn both this and next year . years to repair total repair is expected to take at least until 2003 .
and deutsche bahn expects there will be additional damage to further regions , as the river elbe makes its way up north .
in addition , in areas where the water is already retreating , “ numerous railways and stations are still overflooded ” , according to achim stauss . in dresden , some of the first regional trains have started arriving and departing from the city ’ s main station , which had been cut off from service for days . for those tracks cut off by flood waters , deutsche bahn has set up a network of replacement buses .

current policies of construction along river banks and in flood plains are now being questioned and environmentalists charge such practices are largely responsible for the severity of the recent floods . “ if we don ’ t change the way we deal with our rivers , we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century ’ , ” said steffi lemke , parliamentary leader of the green party . such talk is finding increasing resonance in germany , as people and politicians survey the vast swathes of land that have been laid waste in parts of eastern and northern germany after the elbe and danube rivers , along with their tributaries , jumped their banks in the wake of torrential rains over central europe . the flood surge in the elbe moved down the river from the czech republic with destructive force , inundating germany ’ s eastern jewel , dresden , then drowning town after town on its way downstream .
despite early warnings and massive efforts to erect dykes and other defenses , the raging water could not be contained . now in the flood ’ s aftermath , the question is : how can we prevent this from happening again ? river conference on wednesday , kurt bodewig , federal minister of transport , building and housing , called for a national conference involving the states , muncipalities and various associations to discuss the future of germany ’ s rivers .
the goal , according to a ministry spokesman , is to come up with a master plan for flood protection .
no date has yet been set . environmentalists have been vocal in their criticism of germany 's current river policies , blaming the severity of the floods on what they see as a misguided policy of constricting rivers with levees and locks and turning them into “ superhighways ” for barge transport . they note that the elbe river is 100 kilometers shorter than it was 150 years ago and that it has lost some 85 % of the forests that once lay in its flood plains .
as a result , the speed of the river has quadrupled , according to the german environmental group bund . “ we demand that both chancellor gerhard schröder and candidate edmund stoiber make this a priority and stop further development along the donau and elbe .
that -lrb- development -rrb- is the cause of the catastrophe that we ’ re dealing with today , ” said gerhard timm , an official with bund .
“ preventive flood protection means giving the rivers room to breathe . ” environmentalists want to use one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- planned for river development on moving the levees back and establishing flood plains that could accept overflows from swollen rivers , slowing them down and preventing widespread flooding in built-up areas . the demands are not falling on deaf ears .
in a cabinet meeting this week , chancellor schröder said a reconsideration of development plans for the elbe river was “ sensible and necessary ” even as his social democrats rejected overall criticism of its elbe policy .
a spokesman from the transport ministry said the government has no plans to enlarge development along the river nor introduce more constricting locks . michael müller , parliamentary flood leader for the spd , could have been reading off a page ripped form an environmentalist handbook when he called it dangerous for people “ when the rivers are deepened , built up , and straightened , or when the flood plains disappear . “ looking at holland past attempts to change river policy in germany have mostly met with failure or lack of interest .
after huge floods on the oder river in 1997 , then chancellor helmut kohl appealed for new measures to ease pressure on the waterway .
in the end , nothing came of it . this time however , the sheer level of devastation could move the german government to act .
it has begun looking at its neighbor , the netherlands , which changed its policies on rivers after floods on the rhine river seven years ago .
the dutch government came up with a new concept to return the river to its original bed .

for both candidates there is much to win - and lose . this sunday , millions of germans will gather around their tv sets for the first time for an event that has long become old hat in the united states : the candidates ' debates . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is more popular than his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will go up against his conservative challenger for the chancellor ’ s seat , edmund stoiber , the successful premier of the state of bavaria . for stoiber , the debate offers an opportunity to rebuild the lead he has held in the polls over schröder for the past nine months but lost this week . for schröder , sunday ’ s televised duel , the first of two , will offer the opportunity to display his superior media charm in order to scrap together badly needed votes that will win him a second four-year term in the chancellery . analysts had been predicting that the debate would be the last chance for schröder and his social democrats , who have suffered in polls as a result of a germany ’ s slumping economy and high unemployment rate . but a poll released friday put schröder ’ s spd ahead of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union / christian social union bloc for the first time in months , something analysts attribute to schröder ’ s leadership during the floods that savaged germany last week . now , schröder advisors want the chancellor to have the last say and scrap an agreed-on coin flip before the debate to decide who would answer first and second .
the proposal is opposed by stoiber 's camp and both sides are still working on a solution . a chance for the media chancellor to shine schröder , whose governing style awakens memories of former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair , is widely considered the more popular of the two candidates .
polls consistently put him ahead of both stoiber and his own spd party comrades . his sharp suits , charm and ability to enjoy a good beer and mix it up with his citizens have earned him the nickname , the “ media chancellor ” . it is that image stoiber and his advisors have been trying to use against schröder since campaigning began in late winter .
the advertising billboards of the christian democratic union and stoiber ’ s christian social union present a candidate who is “ exact and squared , ” the total opposite of the slick , too-fast image stoiber advisers say schröder exudes . psychologists and media experts say this sunday ’ s appearance will be crucial for both candidates in reaching the roughly 30 percent of the population still undecided on how they will vote on sept .
22 . ” the first impression is decisive , ” said media psychologist siegfried frey in a recent interview with the magazine " psychologie heute " .
“ we immediately have an opinion of a person and evaluate such complex characteristics as competence , underhanded-ness , tolerance and ambition . ” gathering for the candidates ' debates those are crucial factors campaign strategists in the united states have long known about .
the first tv debate took place between incumbent vice president richard nixon and democratic challenger john f. kennedy in 1960 .
kennedy , tanned and confident , shut down the favored , but haggard-looking nixon and went on to win the election . since then , seven pairs of u.s. presidential hopefuls have duelled before massive national television audiences .
the 2000 campaign featured three televised debates , with texas governor george w. bush winning the upper hand in the final two . the format is entirely new to germany .
former chancellor helmut kohl ruled western germany and the reunified germany from 1982 until 1998 and never felt the need to do much campaigning , much less live debating when re-election time came around . but the emergence of the media-savvy schröder , who went on to unseat kohl changed all that . both candidates have outfitted themselves with experienced media advisors who to a large extent have shaped the image the two present to voters . the move has benefited stoiber , who became the butt of many jokes following his stuttering , awkward first appearance on national tv talk show in january .
analysts are n't expecting a repeat performance this sunday .
stoiber has already become smoother in live appearances . but whether he can out-media the media chancellor remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

current policies of construction along river banks and in flood plains are now being questioned and environmentalists charge such practices are largely responsible for the severity of the recent floods . “ if we don ’ t change the way we deal with our rivers , we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century ’ , ” said steffi lemke , parliamentary leader of the green party . such talk is finding increasing resonance in germany , as people and politicians survey the vast swathes of land that have been laid waste in parts of eastern and northern germany after the elbe and danube rivers , along with their tributaries , jumped their banks in the wake of torrential rains over central europe . the flood surge in the elbe moved down the river from the czech republic with destructive force , inundating germany ’ s eastern jewel , dresden , then drowning town after town on its way downstream .

in a cabinet meeting this week , chancellor schröder said a reconsideration of development plans for the elbe river was “ sensible and necessary ” even as his social democrats rejected overall criticism of its elbe policy .
a spokesman from the transport ministry said the government has no plans to enlarge development along the river nor introduce more constricting locks . michael müller , parliamentary flood leader for the spd , could have been reading off a page ripped form an environmentalist handbook when he called it dangerous for people “ when the rivers are deepened , built up , and straightened , or when the flood plains disappear . “ looking at holland past attempts to change river policy in germany have mostly met with failure or lack of interest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.08.2002 germans to tune in for first candidate debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kickoff millions of germans will tune into the country 's first-ever televised debate between chancellor candidates this sunday .
for both candidates there is much to win - and lose . this sunday , millions of germans will gather around their tv sets for the first time for an event that has long become old hat in the united states : the candidates ' debates . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is more popular than his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will go up against his conservative challenger for the chancellor ’ s seat , edmund stoiber , the successful premier of the state of bavaria . for stoiber , the debate offers an opportunity to rebuild the lead he has held in the polls over schröder for the past nine months but lost this week . for schröder , sunday ’ s televised duel , the first of two , will offer the opportunity to display his superior media charm in order to scrap together badly needed votes that will win him a second four-year term in the chancellery . analysts had been predicting that the debate would be the last chance for schröder and his social democrats , who have suffered in polls as a result of a germany ’ s slumping economy and high unemployment rate . but a poll released friday put schröder ’ s spd ahead of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union / christian social union bloc for the first time in months , something analysts attribute to schröder ’ s leadership during the floods that savaged germany last week . now , schröder advisors want the chancellor to have the last say and scrap an agreed-on coin flip before the debate to decide who would answer first and second .
the proposal is opposed by stoiber 's camp and both sides are still working on a solution . a chance for the media chancellor to shine schröder , whose governing style awakens memories of former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair , is widely considered the more popular of the two candidates .
polls consistently put him ahead of both stoiber and his own spd party comrades . his sharp suits , charm and ability to enjoy a good beer and mix it up with his citizens have earned him the nickname , the “ media chancellor ” . it is that image stoiber and his advisors have been trying to use against schröder since campaigning began in late winter .
the advertising billboards of the christian democratic union and stoiber ’ s christian social union present a candidate who is “ exact and squared , ” the total opposite of the slick , too-fast image stoiber advisers say schröder exudes . psychologists and media experts say this sunday ’ s appearance will be crucial for both candidates in reaching the roughly 30 percent of the population still undecided on how they will vote on sept .
22 . ” the first impression is decisive , ” said media psychologist siegfried frey in a recent interview with the magazine " psychologie heute " .
“ we immediately have an opinion of a person and evaluate such complex characteristics as competence , underhanded-ness , tolerance and ambition . ” gathering for the candidates ' debates those are crucial factors campaign strategists in the united states have long known about .
the first tv debate took place between incumbent vice president richard nixon and democratic challenger john f. kennedy in 1960 .
kennedy , tanned and confident , shut down the favored , but haggard-looking nixon and went on to win the election . since then , seven pairs of u.s. presidential hopefuls have duelled before massive national television audiences .
the 2000 campaign featured three televised debates , with texas governor george w. bush winning the upper hand in the final two . the format is entirely new to germany .
former chancellor helmut kohl ruled western germany and the reunified germany from 1982 until 1998 and never felt the need to do much campaigning , much less live debating when re-election time came around . but the emergence of the media-savvy schröder , who went on to unseat kohl changed all that . both candidates have outfitted themselves with experienced media advisors who to a large extent have shaped the image the two present to voters . the move has benefited stoiber , who became the butt of many jokes following his stuttering , awkward first appearance on national tv talk show in january .
analysts are n't expecting a repeat performance this sunday .
stoiber has already become smoother in live appearances . but whether he can out-media the media chancellor remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

and with water levels rising farther north , there may be more damage to come . north of the city of dresden , one of the regions hardest hit by last week ’ s devastating flood waters , people are bracing themselves for the surging waters of the river elbe , which are slowly moving upstream . further south , in saxony , saxony-anhalt and brandenburg , repair work has begun .
in berlin , the german government has put the cost of repair damage at some 15 billion euro .
but in wide areas of german infrastructure the exact costs are still largely unknown . according to deutsche bahn spokesman achim stauss , “ it will take weeks before the exact dimension of the damage done is known ” .
but what is clear is that repairs will cost billions - with the only question being whether they will be in the single or double digits . germany ’ s rail network has been particularly hard hit by the recent floods , which destroyed the livelihoods of millions of central europeans last week .
rail lines , roads and bridges were simply washed away in the surging torrents .
and as the swollen waters of the river elbe continue to rise farther up north , so too could the costs of damage to germany ’ s national rail network , according to another deutsche bahn spokesman , hans-georg kusznir . deutsche bahn has now organised a crisis centre in dresden to estimate the precise scope of the damage . according to stauss , “ the worst damage has been done in saxony . ”
dresden , at the heart of saxony , is a crucial link in the central german railway network .
“ our main aim is to repair the main rail lines , in order to get the central german region back on track ” , the company said in a statement . the company 's highest priority is to repair the dresden-leipzig-chemnitz connection , a heavily frequented line in a highly industrial region in germany ’ s east . financing still unclear “ details on the financing of this work will have to be solved later ” , kusznir said .
however , funds for immediate repair have already been made available .
“ for the year 2002 the bahn has around 2.5 billion euro for investments in the current network , ” he said . deutsche bahn will make the flooded regions a priority in the distribution of these funds , he said . fears that planned projects , such as the modernisation of dresden ’ s 100-year-old station , will be neglected due to flood repairs , have been denied by deutsche bahn .
but some projects will inevitably have to be postponed . additionally , the german government has promised to help deutsche bahn where it can .
“ we will help the company ” , transport minister kurt bodewig , a social democrat , pledged on tuesday .
the government has already planned a record sum for the rail company in this year ’ s budget .
bodewig said one billion euro had been designated for the bahn both this and next year . years to repair total repair is expected to take at least until 2003 .
and deutsche bahn expects there will be additional damage to further regions , as the river elbe makes its way up north .
in addition , in areas where the water is already retreating , “ numerous railways and stations are still overflooded ” , according to achim stauss . in dresden , some of the first regional trains have started arriving and departing from the city ’ s main station , which had been cut off from service for days . for those tracks cut off by flood waters , deutsche bahn has set up a network of replacement buses .
but even here , there are daily difficulties .
“ many of the roads are still overflooded too ” , stauss says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , hundreds of deutsche bahn employees are helping out at the hot spots and working extra hours .
according to stauss , numerous trainees have taken on voluntary work , helping to clear up damaged rail tracks , in call centres or supervising stations . but stauss say the rail company ’ s employees face the same difficulties as other workers in the affected areas .

but in wide areas of german infrastructure the exact costs are still largely unknown . according to deutsche bahn spokesman achim stauss , “ it will take weeks before the exact dimension of the damage done is known ” .
but what is clear is that repairs will cost billions - with the only question being whether they will be in the single or double digits . germany ’ s rail network has been particularly hard hit by the recent floods , which destroyed the livelihoods of millions of central europeans last week .
rail lines , roads and bridges were simply washed away in the surging torrents .
and as the swollen waters of the river elbe continue to rise farther up north , so too could the costs of damage to germany ’ s national rail network , according to another deutsche bahn spokesman , hans-georg kusznir . deutsche bahn has now organised a crisis centre in dresden to estimate the precise scope of the damage . according to stauss , “ the worst damage has been done in saxony . ”
dresden , at the heart of saxony , is a crucial link in the central german railway network .
“ our main aim is to repair the main rail lines , in order to get the central german region back on track ” , the company said in a statement . the company 's highest priority is to repair the dresden-leipzig-chemnitz connection , a heavily frequented line in a highly industrial region in germany ’ s east . financing still unclear “ details on the financing of this work will have to be solved later ” , kusznir said .
however , funds for immediate repair have already been made available .
“ for the year 2002 the bahn has around 2.5 billion euro for investments in the current network , ” he said . deutsche bahn will make the flooded regions a priority in the distribution of these funds , he said . fears that planned projects , such as the modernisation of dresden ’ s 100-year-old station , will be neglected due to flood repairs , have been denied by deutsche bahn .
but some projects will inevitably have to be postponed . additionally , the german government has promised to help deutsche bahn where it can .
“ we will help the company ” , transport minister kurt bodewig , a social democrat , pledged on tuesday .
the government has already planned a record sum for the rail company in this year ’ s budget .
bodewig said one billion euro had been designated for the bahn both this and next year . years to repair total repair is expected to take at least until 2003 .
and deutsche bahn expects there will be additional damage to further regions , as the river elbe makes its way up north .
in addition , in areas where the water is already retreating , “ numerous railways and stations are still overflooded ” , according to achim stauss . in dresden , some of the first regional trains have started arriving and departing from the city ’ s main station , which had been cut off from service for days . for those tracks cut off by flood waters , deutsche bahn has set up a network of replacement buses .

and with water levels rising farther north , there may be more damage to come . north of the city of dresden , one of the regions hardest hit by last week ’ s devastating flood waters , people are bracing themselves for the surging waters of the river elbe , which are slowly moving upstream . further south , in saxony , saxony-anhalt and brandenburg , repair work has begun .
in berlin , the german government has put the cost of repair damage at some 15 billion euro .
but in wide areas of german infrastructure the exact costs are still largely unknown . according to deutsche bahn spokesman achim stauss , “ it will take weeks before the exact dimension of the damage done is known ” .
but what is clear is that repairs will cost billions - with the only question being whether they will be in the single or double digits . germany ’ s rail network has been particularly hard hit by the recent floods , which destroyed the livelihoods of millions of central europeans last week .
rail lines , roads and bridges were simply washed away in the surging torrents .
and as the swollen waters of the river elbe continue to rise farther up north , so too could the costs of damage to germany ’ s national rail network , according to another deutsche bahn spokesman , hans-georg kusznir . deutsche bahn has now organised a crisis centre in dresden to estimate the precise scope of the damage . according to stauss , “ the worst damage has been done in saxony . ”
dresden , at the heart of saxony , is a crucial link in the central german railway network .
“ our main aim is to repair the main rail lines , in order to get the central german region back on track ” , the company said in a statement . the company 's highest priority is to repair the dresden-leipzig-chemnitz connection , a heavily frequented line in a highly industrial region in germany ’ s east . financing still unclear “ details on the financing of this work will have to be solved later ” , kusznir said .
however , funds for immediate repair have already been made available .
“ for the year 2002 the bahn has around 2.5 billion euro for investments in the current network , ” he said . deutsche bahn will make the flooded regions a priority in the distribution of these funds , he said . fears that planned projects , such as the modernisation of dresden ’ s 100-year-old station , will be neglected due to flood repairs , have been denied by deutsche bahn .
but some projects will inevitably have to be postponed . additionally , the german government has promised to help deutsche bahn where it can .
“ we will help the company ” , transport minister kurt bodewig , a social democrat , pledged on tuesday .
the government has already planned a record sum for the rail company in this year ’ s budget .
bodewig said one billion euro had been designated for the bahn both this and next year . years to repair total repair is expected to take at least until 2003 .
and deutsche bahn expects there will be additional damage to further regions , as the river elbe makes its way up north .
in addition , in areas where the water is already retreating , “ numerous railways and stations are still overflooded ” , according to achim stauss . in dresden , some of the first regional trains have started arriving and departing from the city ’ s main station , which had been cut off from service for days . for those tracks cut off by flood waters , deutsche bahn has set up a network of replacement buses .
but even here , there are daily difficulties .
“ many of the roads are still overflooded too ” , stauss says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , hundreds of deutsche bahn employees are helping out at the hot spots and working extra hours .
according to stauss , numerous trainees have taken on voluntary work , helping to clear up damaged rail tracks , in call centres or supervising stations . but stauss say the rail company ’ s employees face the same difficulties as other workers in the affected areas .

current policies of construction along river banks and in flood plains are now being questioned and environmentalists charge such practices are largely responsible for the severity of the recent floods . “ if we don ’ t change the way we deal with our rivers , we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century ’ , ” said steffi lemke , parliamentary leader of the green party . such talk is finding increasing resonance in germany , as people and politicians survey the vast swathes of land that have been laid waste in parts of eastern and northern germany after the elbe and danube rivers , along with their tributaries , jumped their banks in the wake of torrential rains over central europe . the flood surge in the elbe moved down the river from the czech republic with destructive force , inundating germany ’ s eastern jewel , dresden , then drowning town after town on its way downstream .
despite early warnings and massive efforts to erect dykes and other defenses , the raging water could not be contained . now in the flood ’ s aftermath , the question is : how can we prevent this from happening again ? river conference on wednesday , kurt bodewig , federal minister of transport , building and housing , called for a national conference involving the states , muncipalities and various associations to discuss the future of germany ’ s rivers .
the goal , according to a ministry spokesman , is to come up with a master plan for flood protection .
no date has yet been set . environmentalists have been vocal in their criticism of germany 's current river policies , blaming the severity of the floods on what they see as a misguided policy of constricting rivers with levees and locks and turning them into “ superhighways ” for barge transport . they note that the elbe river is 100 kilometers shorter than it was 150 years ago and that it has lost some 85 % of the forests that once lay in its flood plains .
as a result , the speed of the river has quadrupled , according to the german environmental group bund . “ we demand that both chancellor gerhard schröder and candidate edmund stoiber make this a priority and stop further development along the donau and elbe .
that -lrb- development -rrb- is the cause of the catastrophe that we ’ re dealing with today , ” said gerhard timm , an official with bund .
“ preventive flood protection means giving the rivers room to breathe . ” environmentalists want to use one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- planned for river development on moving the levees back and establishing flood plains that could accept overflows from swollen rivers , slowing them down and preventing widespread flooding in built-up areas . the demands are not falling on deaf ears .
in a cabinet meeting this week , chancellor schröder said a reconsideration of development plans for the elbe river was “ sensible and necessary ” even as his social democrats rejected overall criticism of its elbe policy .
a spokesman from the transport ministry said the government has no plans to enlarge development along the river nor introduce more constricting locks . michael müller , parliamentary flood leader for the spd , could have been reading off a page ripped form an environmentalist handbook when he called it dangerous for people “ when the rivers are deepened , built up , and straightened , or when the flood plains disappear . “ looking at holland past attempts to change river policy in germany have mostly met with failure or lack of interest .

in the end , nothing came of it . this time however , the sheer level of devastation could move the german government to act .
it has begun looking at its neighbor , the netherlands , which changed its policies on rivers after floods on the rhine river seven years ago .
the dutch government came up with a new concept to return the river to its original bed .

and with water levels rising farther north , there may be more damage to come . north of the city of dresden , one of the regions hardest hit by last week ’ s devastating flood waters , people are bracing themselves for the surging waters of the river elbe , which are slowly moving upstream . further south , in saxony , saxony-anhalt and brandenburg , repair work has begun .
in berlin , the german government has put the cost of repair damage at some 15 billion euro .
but in wide areas of german infrastructure the exact costs are still largely unknown . according to deutsche bahn spokesman achim stauss , “ it will take weeks before the exact dimension of the damage done is known ” .
but what is clear is that repairs will cost billions - with the only question being whether they will be in the single or double digits . germany ’ s rail network has been particularly hard hit by the recent floods , which destroyed the livelihoods of millions of central europeans last week .
rail lines , roads and bridges were simply washed away in the surging torrents .
and as the swollen waters of the river elbe continue to rise farther up north , so too could the costs of damage to germany ’ s national rail network , according to another deutsche bahn spokesman , hans-georg kusznir . deutsche bahn has now organised a crisis centre in dresden to estimate the precise scope of the damage . according to stauss , “ the worst damage has been done in saxony . ”
dresden , at the heart of saxony , is a crucial link in the central german railway network .
“ our main aim is to repair the main rail lines , in order to get the central german region back on track ” , the company said in a statement . the company 's highest priority is to repair the dresden-leipzig-chemnitz connection , a heavily frequented line in a highly industrial region in germany ’ s east . financing still unclear “ details on the financing of this work will have to be solved later ” , kusznir said .
however , funds for immediate repair have already been made available .
“ for the year 2002 the bahn has around 2.5 billion euro for investments in the current network , ” he said . deutsche bahn will make the flooded regions a priority in the distribution of these funds , he said . fears that planned projects , such as the modernisation of dresden ’ s 100-year-old station , will be neglected due to flood repairs , have been denied by deutsche bahn .
but some projects will inevitably have to be postponed . additionally , the german government has promised to help deutsche bahn where it can .
“ we will help the company ” , transport minister kurt bodewig , a social democrat , pledged on tuesday .
the government has already planned a record sum for the rail company in this year ’ s budget .
bodewig said one billion euro had been designated for the bahn both this and next year . years to repair total repair is expected to take at least until 2003 .
and deutsche bahn expects there will be additional damage to further regions , as the river elbe makes its way up north .
in addition , in areas where the water is already retreating , “ numerous railways and stations are still overflooded ” , according to achim stauss . in dresden , some of the first regional trains have started arriving and departing from the city ’ s main station , which had been cut off from service for days . for those tracks cut off by flood waters , deutsche bahn has set up a network of replacement buses .
but even here , there are daily difficulties .
“ many of the roads are still overflooded too ” , stauss says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , hundreds of deutsche bahn employees are helping out at the hot spots and working extra hours .
according to stauss , numerous trainees have taken on voluntary work , helping to clear up damaged rail tracks , in call centres or supervising stations . but stauss say the rail company ’ s employees face the same difficulties as other workers in the affected areas .

for both candidates there is much to win - and lose . this sunday , millions of germans will gather around their tv sets for the first time for an event that has long become old hat in the united states : the candidates ' debates . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is more popular than his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will go up against his conservative challenger for the chancellor ’ s seat , edmund stoiber , the successful premier of the state of bavaria . for stoiber , the debate offers an opportunity to rebuild the lead he has held in the polls over schröder for the past nine months but lost this week . for schröder , sunday ’ s televised duel , the first of two , will offer the opportunity to display his superior media charm in order to scrap together badly needed votes that will win him a second four-year term in the chancellery . analysts had been predicting that the debate would be the last chance for schröder and his social democrats , who have suffered in polls as a result of a germany ’ s slumping economy and high unemployment rate . but a poll released friday put schröder ’ s spd ahead of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union / christian social union bloc for the first time in months , something analysts attribute to schröder ’ s leadership during the floods that savaged germany last week . now , schröder advisors want the chancellor to have the last say and scrap an agreed-on coin flip before the debate to decide who would answer first and second .
the proposal is opposed by stoiber 's camp and both sides are still working on a solution . a chance for the media chancellor to shine schröder , whose governing style awakens memories of former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair , is widely considered the more popular of the two candidates .
polls consistently put him ahead of both stoiber and his own spd party comrades . his sharp suits , charm and ability to enjoy a good beer and mix it up with his citizens have earned him the nickname , the “ media chancellor ” . it is that image stoiber and his advisors have been trying to use against schröder since campaigning began in late winter .
the advertising billboards of the christian democratic union and stoiber ’ s christian social union present a candidate who is “ exact and squared , ” the total opposite of the slick , too-fast image stoiber advisers say schröder exudes . psychologists and media experts say this sunday ’ s appearance will be crucial for both candidates in reaching the roughly 30 percent of the population still undecided on how they will vote on sept .
22 . ” the first impression is decisive , ” said media psychologist siegfried frey in a recent interview with the magazine " psychologie heute " .
“ we immediately have an opinion of a person and evaluate such complex characteristics as competence , underhanded-ness , tolerance and ambition . ” gathering for the candidates ' debates those are crucial factors campaign strategists in the united states have long known about .
the first tv debate took place between incumbent vice president richard nixon and democratic challenger john f. kennedy in 1960 .
kennedy , tanned and confident , shut down the favored , but haggard-looking nixon and went on to win the election . since then , seven pairs of u.s. presidential hopefuls have duelled before massive national television audiences .
the 2000 campaign featured three televised debates , with texas governor george w. bush winning the upper hand in the final two . the format is entirely new to germany .

current policies of construction along river banks and in flood plains are now being questioned and environmentalists charge such practices are largely responsible for the severity of the recent floods . “ if we don ’ t change the way we deal with our rivers , we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century ’ , ” said steffi lemke , parliamentary leader of the green party . such talk is finding increasing resonance in germany , as people and politicians survey the vast swathes of land that have been laid waste in parts of eastern and northern germany after the elbe and danube rivers , along with their tributaries , jumped their banks in the wake of torrential rains over central europe . the flood surge in the elbe moved down the river from the czech republic with destructive force , inundating germany ’ s eastern jewel , dresden , then drowning town after town on its way downstream .
despite early warnings and massive efforts to erect dykes and other defenses , the raging water could not be contained . now in the flood ’ s aftermath , the question is : how can we prevent this from happening again ? river conference on wednesday , kurt bodewig , federal minister of transport , building and housing , called for a national conference involving the states , muncipalities and various associations to discuss the future of germany ’ s rivers .
the goal , according to a ministry spokesman , is to come up with a master plan for flood protection .
no date has yet been set . environmentalists have been vocal in their criticism of germany 's current river policies , blaming the severity of the floods on what they see as a misguided policy of constricting rivers with levees and locks and turning them into “ superhighways ” for barge transport . they note that the elbe river is 100 kilometers shorter than it was 150 years ago and that it has lost some 85 % of the forests that once lay in its flood plains .
as a result , the speed of the river has quadrupled , according to the german environmental group bund . “ we demand that both chancellor gerhard schröder and candidate edmund stoiber make this a priority and stop further development along the donau and elbe .
that -lrb- development -rrb- is the cause of the catastrophe that we ’ re dealing with today , ” said gerhard timm , an official with bund .
“ preventive flood protection means giving the rivers room to breathe . ” environmentalists want to use one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- planned for river development on moving the levees back and establishing flood plains that could accept overflows from swollen rivers , slowing them down and preventing widespread flooding in built-up areas . the demands are not falling on deaf ears .
in a cabinet meeting this week , chancellor schröder said a reconsideration of development plans for the elbe river was “ sensible and necessary ” even as his social democrats rejected overall criticism of its elbe policy .
a spokesman from the transport ministry said the government has no plans to enlarge development along the river nor introduce more constricting locks . michael müller , parliamentary flood leader for the spd , could have been reading off a page ripped form an environmentalist handbook when he called it dangerous for people “ when the rivers are deepened , built up , and straightened , or when the flood plains disappear . “ looking at holland past attempts to change river policy in germany have mostly met with failure or lack of interest .
after huge floods on the oder river in 1997 , then chancellor helmut kohl appealed for new measures to ease pressure on the waterway .
in the end , nothing came of it . this time however , the sheer level of devastation could move the german government to act .
it has begun looking at its neighbor , the netherlands , which changed its policies on rivers after floods on the rhine river seven years ago .
the dutch government came up with a new concept to return the river to its original bed .
it moved the levees back some 200 meters and specified certains areas that could be flooded if necessary to relieve pressure on the river . german thinking could be moving in that direction . “ we need to build with the river , “ said transportation minister bodewig , “ not against the current . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fleeing an angry river one of thousands of evacuees in dresden last week , frank jesuiter 's concern was especially acute .

for both candidates there is much to win - and lose . this sunday , millions of germans will gather around their tv sets for the first time for an event that has long become old hat in the united states : the candidates ' debates . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is more popular than his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will go up against his conservative challenger for the chancellor ’ s seat , edmund stoiber , the successful premier of the state of bavaria . for stoiber , the debate offers an opportunity to rebuild the lead he has held in the polls over schröder for the past nine months but lost this week . for schröder , sunday ’ s televised duel , the first of two , will offer the opportunity to display his superior media charm in order to scrap together badly needed votes that will win him a second four-year term in the chancellery . analysts had been predicting that the debate would be the last chance for schröder and his social democrats , who have suffered in polls as a result of a germany ’ s slumping economy and high unemployment rate . but a poll released friday put schröder ’ s spd ahead of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union / christian social union bloc for the first time in months , something analysts attribute to schröder ’ s leadership during the floods that savaged germany last week . now , schröder advisors want the chancellor to have the last say and scrap an agreed-on coin flip before the debate to decide who would answer first and second .

for both candidates there is much to win - and lose . this sunday , millions of germans will gather around their tv sets for the first time for an event that has long become old hat in the united states : the candidates ' debates . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is more popular than his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will go up against his conservative challenger for the chancellor ’ s seat , edmund stoiber , the successful premier of the state of bavaria . for stoiber , the debate offers an opportunity to rebuild the lead he has held in the polls over schröder for the past nine months but lost this week . for schröder , sunday ’ s televised duel , the first of two , will offer the opportunity to display his superior media charm in order to scrap together badly needed votes that will win him a second four-year term in the chancellery . analysts had been predicting that the debate would be the last chance for schröder and his social democrats , who have suffered in polls as a result of a germany ’ s slumping economy and high unemployment rate . but a poll released friday put schröder ’ s spd ahead of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union / christian social union bloc for the first time in months , something analysts attribute to schröder ’ s leadership during the floods that savaged germany last week . now , schröder advisors want the chancellor to have the last say and scrap an agreed-on coin flip before the debate to decide who would answer first and second .
the proposal is opposed by stoiber 's camp and both sides are still working on a solution . a chance for the media chancellor to shine schröder , whose governing style awakens memories of former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair , is widely considered the more popular of the two candidates .
polls consistently put him ahead of both stoiber and his own spd party comrades . his sharp suits , charm and ability to enjoy a good beer and mix it up with his citizens have earned him the nickname , the “ media chancellor ” . it is that image stoiber and his advisors have been trying to use against schröder since campaigning began in late winter .
the advertising billboards of the christian democratic union and stoiber ’ s christian social union present a candidate who is “ exact and squared , ” the total opposite of the slick , too-fast image stoiber advisers say schröder exudes . psychologists and media experts say this sunday ’ s appearance will be crucial for both candidates in reaching the roughly 30 percent of the population still undecided on how they will vote on sept .
22 . ” the first impression is decisive , ” said media psychologist siegfried frey in a recent interview with the magazine " psychologie heute " .
“ we immediately have an opinion of a person and evaluate such complex characteristics as competence , underhanded-ness , tolerance and ambition . ” gathering for the candidates ' debates those are crucial factors campaign strategists in the united states have long known about .
the first tv debate took place between incumbent vice president richard nixon and democratic challenger john f. kennedy in 1960 .
kennedy , tanned and confident , shut down the favored , but haggard-looking nixon and went on to win the election . since then , seven pairs of u.s. presidential hopefuls have duelled before massive national television audiences .
the 2000 campaign featured three televised debates , with texas governor george w. bush winning the upper hand in the final two . the format is entirely new to germany .
former chancellor helmut kohl ruled western germany and the reunified germany from 1982 until 1998 and never felt the need to do much campaigning , much less live debating when re-election time came around . but the emergence of the media-savvy schröder , who went on to unseat kohl changed all that . both candidates have outfitted themselves with experienced media advisors who to a large extent have shaped the image the two present to voters . the move has benefited stoiber , who became the butt of many jokes following his stuttering , awkward first appearance on national tv talk show in january .
analysts are n't expecting a repeat performance this sunday .
stoiber has already become smoother in live appearances . but whether he can out-media the media chancellor remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

and with water levels rising farther north , there may be more damage to come . north of the city of dresden , one of the regions hardest hit by last week ’ s devastating flood waters , people are bracing themselves for the surging waters of the river elbe , which are slowly moving upstream . further south , in saxony , saxony-anhalt and brandenburg , repair work has begun .
in berlin , the german government has put the cost of repair damage at some 15 billion euro .
but in wide areas of german infrastructure the exact costs are still largely unknown . according to deutsche bahn spokesman achim stauss , “ it will take weeks before the exact dimension of the damage done is known ” .
but what is clear is that repairs will cost billions - with the only question being whether they will be in the single or double digits . germany ’ s rail network has been particularly hard hit by the recent floods , which destroyed the livelihoods of millions of central europeans last week .
rail lines , roads and bridges were simply washed away in the surging torrents .
and as the swollen waters of the river elbe continue to rise farther up north , so too could the costs of damage to germany ’ s national rail network , according to another deutsche bahn spokesman , hans-georg kusznir . deutsche bahn has now organised a crisis centre in dresden to estimate the precise scope of the damage . according to stauss , “ the worst damage has been done in saxony . ”
dresden , at the heart of saxony , is a crucial link in the central german railway network .
“ our main aim is to repair the main rail lines , in order to get the central german region back on track ” , the company said in a statement . the company 's highest priority is to repair the dresden-leipzig-chemnitz connection , a heavily frequented line in a highly industrial region in germany ’ s east . financing still unclear “ details on the financing of this work will have to be solved later ” , kusznir said .
however , funds for immediate repair have already been made available .
“ for the year 2002 the bahn has around 2.5 billion euro for investments in the current network , ” he said . deutsche bahn will make the flooded regions a priority in the distribution of these funds , he said . fears that planned projects , such as the modernisation of dresden ’ s 100-year-old station , will be neglected due to flood repairs , have been denied by deutsche bahn .
but some projects will inevitably have to be postponed . additionally , the german government has promised to help deutsche bahn where it can .
“ we will help the company ” , transport minister kurt bodewig , a social democrat , pledged on tuesday .
the government has already planned a record sum for the rail company in this year ’ s budget .
bodewig said one billion euro had been designated for the bahn both this and next year . years to repair total repair is expected to take at least until 2003 .
and deutsche bahn expects there will be additional damage to further regions , as the river elbe makes its way up north .
in addition , in areas where the water is already retreating , “ numerous railways and stations are still overflooded ” , according to achim stauss . in dresden , some of the first regional trains have started arriving and departing from the city ’ s main station , which had been cut off from service for days . for those tracks cut off by flood waters , deutsche bahn has set up a network of replacement buses .
but even here , there are daily difficulties .
“ many of the roads are still overflooded too ” , stauss says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , hundreds of deutsche bahn employees are helping out at the hot spots and working extra hours .
according to stauss , numerous trainees have taken on voluntary work , helping to clear up damaged rail tracks , in call centres or supervising stations . but stauss say the rail company ’ s employees face the same difficulties as other workers in the affected areas .

current policies of construction along river banks and in flood plains are now being questioned and environmentalists charge such practices are largely responsible for the severity of the recent floods . “ if we don ’ t change the way we deal with our rivers , we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century ’ , ” said steffi lemke , parliamentary leader of the green party . such talk is finding increasing resonance in germany , as people and politicians survey the vast swathes of land that have been laid waste in parts of eastern and northern germany after the elbe and danube rivers , along with their tributaries , jumped their banks in the wake of torrential rains over central europe . the flood surge in the elbe moved down the river from the czech republic with destructive force , inundating germany ’ s eastern jewel , dresden , then drowning town after town on its way downstream .

the goal , according to a ministry spokesman , is to come up with a master plan for flood protection .
no date has yet been set . environmentalists have been vocal in their criticism of germany 's current river policies , blaming the severity of the floods on what they see as a misguided policy of constricting rivers with levees and locks and turning them into “ superhighways ” for barge transport . they note that the elbe river is 100 kilometers shorter than it was 150 years ago and that it has lost some 85 % of the forests that once lay in its flood plains .
as a result , the speed of the river has quadrupled , according to the german environmental group bund . “ we demand that both chancellor gerhard schröder and candidate edmund stoiber make this a priority and stop further development along the donau and elbe .

in a cabinet meeting this week , chancellor schröder said a reconsideration of development plans for the elbe river was “ sensible and necessary ” even as his social democrats rejected overall criticism of its elbe policy .
a spokesman from the transport ministry said the government has no plans to enlarge development along the river nor introduce more constricting locks . michael müller , parliamentary flood leader for the spd , could have been reading off a page ripped form an environmentalist handbook when he called it dangerous for people “ when the rivers are deepened , built up , and straightened , or when the flood plains disappear . “ looking at holland past attempts to change river policy in germany have mostly met with failure or lack of interest .
after huge floods on the oder river in 1997 , then chancellor helmut kohl appealed for new measures to ease pressure on the waterway .
in the end , nothing came of it . this time however , the sheer level of devastation could move the german government to act .

in berlin , the german government has put the cost of repair damage at some 15 billion euro .
but in wide areas of german infrastructure the exact costs are still largely unknown . according to deutsche bahn spokesman achim stauss , “ it will take weeks before the exact dimension of the damage done is known ” .
but what is clear is that repairs will cost billions - with the only question being whether they will be in the single or double digits . germany ’ s rail network has been particularly hard hit by the recent floods , which destroyed the livelihoods of millions of central europeans last week .

however , funds for immediate repair have already been made available .
“ for the year 2002 the bahn has around 2.5 billion euro for investments in the current network , ” he said . deutsche bahn will make the flooded regions a priority in the distribution of these funds , he said . fears that planned projects , such as the modernisation of dresden ’ s 100-year-old station , will be neglected due to flood repairs , have been denied by deutsche bahn .
but some projects will inevitably have to be postponed . additionally , the german government has promised to help deutsche bahn where it can .

for both candidates there is much to win - and lose . this sunday , millions of germans will gather around their tv sets for the first time for an event that has long become old hat in the united states : the candidates ' debates . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is more popular than his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will go up against his conservative challenger for the chancellor ’ s seat , edmund stoiber , the successful premier of the state of bavaria . for stoiber , the debate offers an opportunity to rebuild the lead he has held in the polls over schröder for the past nine months but lost this week . for schröder , sunday ’ s televised duel , the first of two , will offer the opportunity to display his superior media charm in order to scrap together badly needed votes that will win him a second four-year term in the chancellery . analysts had been predicting that the debate would be the last chance for schröder and his social democrats , who have suffered in polls as a result of a germany ’ s slumping economy and high unemployment rate . but a poll released friday put schröder ’ s spd ahead of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union / christian social union bloc for the first time in months , something analysts attribute to schröder ’ s leadership during the floods that savaged germany last week . now , schröder advisors want the chancellor to have the last say and scrap an agreed-on coin flip before the debate to decide who would answer first and second .
the proposal is opposed by stoiber 's camp and both sides are still working on a solution . a chance for the media chancellor to shine schröder , whose governing style awakens memories of former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair , is widely considered the more popular of the two candidates .

the advertising billboards of the christian democratic union and stoiber ’ s christian social union present a candidate who is “ exact and squared , ” the total opposite of the slick , too-fast image stoiber advisers say schröder exudes . psychologists and media experts say this sunday ’ s appearance will be crucial for both candidates in reaching the roughly 30 percent of the population still undecided on how they will vote on sept .

the first tv debate took place between incumbent vice president richard nixon and democratic challenger john f. kennedy in 1960 .
kennedy , tanned and confident , shut down the favored , but haggard-looking nixon and went on to win the election . since then , seven pairs of u.s. presidential hopefuls have duelled before massive national television audiences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.08.2002 rethinking germany ’ s rivers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working to keep the waters back in the wake of central europe ’ s devastating floods , politicians in germany are reconsidering the country ’ s policies toward its rivers . as german politicians struggle to come up with the billions of euros needed to rebuild after the worst floods of the century , some prominent voices are calling for a new strategy regarding development along the nation ’ s rivers .
current policies of construction along river banks and in flood plains are now being questioned and environmentalists charge such practices are largely responsible for the severity of the recent floods . “ if we don ’ t change the way we deal with our rivers , we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century ’ , ” said steffi lemke , parliamentary leader of the green party . such talk is finding increasing resonance in germany , as people and politicians survey the vast swathes of land that have been laid waste in parts of eastern and northern germany after the elbe and danube rivers , along with their tributaries , jumped their banks in the wake of torrential rains over central europe . the flood surge in the elbe moved down the river from the czech republic with destructive force , inundating germany ’ s eastern jewel , dresden , then drowning town after town on its way downstream .
despite early warnings and massive efforts to erect dykes and other defenses , the raging water could not be contained . now in the flood ’ s aftermath , the question is : how can we prevent this from happening again ? river conference on wednesday , kurt bodewig , federal minister of transport , building and housing , called for a national conference involving the states , muncipalities and various associations to discuss the future of germany ’ s rivers .
the goal , according to a ministry spokesman , is to come up with a master plan for flood protection .
no date has yet been set . environmentalists have been vocal in their criticism of germany 's current river policies , blaming the severity of the floods on what they see as a misguided policy of constricting rivers with levees and locks and turning them into “ superhighways ” for barge transport . they note that the elbe river is 100 kilometers shorter than it was 150 years ago and that it has lost some 85 % of the forests that once lay in its flood plains .
as a result , the speed of the river has quadrupled , according to the german environmental group bund . “ we demand that both chancellor gerhard schröder and candidate edmund stoiber make this a priority and stop further development along the donau and elbe .
that -lrb- development -rrb- is the cause of the catastrophe that we ’ re dealing with today , ” said gerhard timm , an official with bund .
“ preventive flood protection means giving the rivers room to breathe . ” environmentalists want to use one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- planned for river development on moving the levees back and establishing flood plains that could accept overflows from swollen rivers , slowing them down and preventing widespread flooding in built-up areas . the demands are not falling on deaf ears .
in a cabinet meeting this week , chancellor schröder said a reconsideration of development plans for the elbe river was “ sensible and necessary ” even as his social democrats rejected overall criticism of its elbe policy .
a spokesman from the transport ministry said the government has no plans to enlarge development along the river nor introduce more constricting locks . michael müller , parliamentary flood leader for the spd , could have been reading off a page ripped form an environmentalist handbook when he called it dangerous for people “ when the rivers are deepened , built up , and straightened , or when the flood plains disappear . “ looking at holland past attempts to change river policy in germany have mostly met with failure or lack of interest .
after huge floods on the oder river in 1997 , then chancellor helmut kohl appealed for new measures to ease pressure on the waterway .
in the end , nothing came of it . this time however , the sheer level of devastation could move the german government to act .
it has begun looking at its neighbor , the netherlands , which changed its policies on rivers after floods on the rhine river seven years ago .
the dutch government came up with a new concept to return the river to its original bed .
it moved the levees back some 200 meters and specified certains areas that could be flooded if necessary to relieve pressure on the river . german thinking could be moving in that direction . “ we need to build with the river , “ said transportation minister bodewig , “ not against the current . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fleeing an angry river one of thousands of evacuees in dresden last week , frank jesuiter 's concern was especially acute .

the historic inner city is flooded - including architectural landmarks like the zwinger palace and the semper opera .

current policies of construction along river banks and in flood plains are now being questioned and environmentalists charge such practices are largely responsible for the severity of the recent floods . “ if we don ’ t change the way we deal with our rivers , we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century ’ , ” said steffi lemke , parliamentary leader of the green party . such talk is finding increasing resonance in germany , as people and politicians survey the vast swathes of land that have been laid waste in parts of eastern and northern germany after the elbe and danube rivers , along with their tributaries , jumped their banks in the wake of torrential rains over central europe . the flood surge in the elbe moved down the river from the czech republic with destructive force , inundating germany ’ s eastern jewel , dresden , then drowning town after town on its way downstream .
despite early warnings and massive efforts to erect dykes and other defenses , the raging water could not be contained . now in the flood ’ s aftermath , the question is : how can we prevent this from happening again ? river conference on wednesday , kurt bodewig , federal minister of transport , building and housing , called for a national conference involving the states , muncipalities and various associations to discuss the future of germany ’ s rivers .
the goal , according to a ministry spokesman , is to come up with a master plan for flood protection .
no date has yet been set . environmentalists have been vocal in their criticism of germany 's current river policies , blaming the severity of the floods on what they see as a misguided policy of constricting rivers with levees and locks and turning them into “ superhighways ” for barge transport . they note that the elbe river is 100 kilometers shorter than it was 150 years ago and that it has lost some 85 % of the forests that once lay in its flood plains .
as a result , the speed of the river has quadrupled , according to the german environmental group bund . “ we demand that both chancellor gerhard schröder and candidate edmund stoiber make this a priority and stop further development along the donau and elbe .
that -lrb- development -rrb- is the cause of the catastrophe that we ’ re dealing with today , ” said gerhard timm , an official with bund .
“ preventive flood protection means giving the rivers room to breathe . ” environmentalists want to use one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- planned for river development on moving the levees back and establishing flood plains that could accept overflows from swollen rivers , slowing them down and preventing widespread flooding in built-up areas . the demands are not falling on deaf ears .
in a cabinet meeting this week , chancellor schröder said a reconsideration of development plans for the elbe river was “ sensible and necessary ” even as his social democrats rejected overall criticism of its elbe policy .
a spokesman from the transport ministry said the government has no plans to enlarge development along the river nor introduce more constricting locks . michael müller , parliamentary flood leader for the spd , could have been reading off a page ripped form an environmentalist handbook when he called it dangerous for people “ when the rivers are deepened , built up , and straightened , or when the flood plains disappear . “ looking at holland past attempts to change river policy in germany have mostly met with failure or lack of interest .
after huge floods on the oder river in 1997 , then chancellor helmut kohl appealed for new measures to ease pressure on the waterway .
in the end , nothing came of it . this time however , the sheer level of devastation could move the german government to act .
it has begun looking at its neighbor , the netherlands , which changed its policies on rivers after floods on the rhine river seven years ago .
the dutch government came up with a new concept to return the river to its original bed .
it moved the levees back some 200 meters and specified certains areas that could be flooded if necessary to relieve pressure on the river . german thinking could be moving in that direction . “ we need to build with the river , “ said transportation minister bodewig , “ not against the current . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fleeing an angry river one of thousands of evacuees in dresden last week , frank jesuiter 's concern was especially acute .

and with water levels rising farther north , there may be more damage to come . north of the city of dresden , one of the regions hardest hit by last week ’ s devastating flood waters , people are bracing themselves for the surging waters of the river elbe , which are slowly moving upstream . further south , in saxony , saxony-anhalt and brandenburg , repair work has begun .
in berlin , the german government has put the cost of repair damage at some 15 billion euro .
but in wide areas of german infrastructure the exact costs are still largely unknown . according to deutsche bahn spokesman achim stauss , “ it will take weeks before the exact dimension of the damage done is known ” .
but what is clear is that repairs will cost billions - with the only question being whether they will be in the single or double digits . germany ’ s rail network has been particularly hard hit by the recent floods , which destroyed the livelihoods of millions of central europeans last week .
rail lines , roads and bridges were simply washed away in the surging torrents .
and as the swollen waters of the river elbe continue to rise farther up north , so too could the costs of damage to germany ’ s national rail network , according to another deutsche bahn spokesman , hans-georg kusznir . deutsche bahn has now organised a crisis centre in dresden to estimate the precise scope of the damage . according to stauss , “ the worst damage has been done in saxony . ”
dresden , at the heart of saxony , is a crucial link in the central german railway network .
“ our main aim is to repair the main rail lines , in order to get the central german region back on track ” , the company said in a statement . the company 's highest priority is to repair the dresden-leipzig-chemnitz connection , a heavily frequented line in a highly industrial region in germany ’ s east . financing still unclear “ details on the financing of this work will have to be solved later ” , kusznir said .
however , funds for immediate repair have already been made available .
“ for the year 2002 the bahn has around 2.5 billion euro for investments in the current network , ” he said . deutsche bahn will make the flooded regions a priority in the distribution of these funds , he said . fears that planned projects , such as the modernisation of dresden ’ s 100-year-old station , will be neglected due to flood repairs , have been denied by deutsche bahn .
but some projects will inevitably have to be postponed . additionally , the german government has promised to help deutsche bahn where it can .
“ we will help the company ” , transport minister kurt bodewig , a social democrat , pledged on tuesday .
the government has already planned a record sum for the rail company in this year ’ s budget .
bodewig said one billion euro had been designated for the bahn both this and next year . years to repair total repair is expected to take at least until 2003 .
and deutsche bahn expects there will be additional damage to further regions , as the river elbe makes its way up north .
in addition , in areas where the water is already retreating , “ numerous railways and stations are still overflooded ” , according to achim stauss . in dresden , some of the first regional trains have started arriving and departing from the city ’ s main station , which had been cut off from service for days . for those tracks cut off by flood waters , deutsche bahn has set up a network of replacement buses .
but even here , there are daily difficulties .

and with water levels rising farther north , there may be more damage to come . north of the city of dresden , one of the regions hardest hit by last week ’ s devastating flood waters , people are bracing themselves for the surging waters of the river elbe , which are slowly moving upstream . further south , in saxony , saxony-anhalt and brandenburg , repair work has begun .
in berlin , the german government has put the cost of repair damage at some 15 billion euro .
but in wide areas of german infrastructure the exact costs are still largely unknown . according to deutsche bahn spokesman achim stauss , “ it will take weeks before the exact dimension of the damage done is known ” .
but what is clear is that repairs will cost billions - with the only question being whether they will be in the single or double digits . germany ’ s rail network has been particularly hard hit by the recent floods , which destroyed the livelihoods of millions of central europeans last week .
rail lines , roads and bridges were simply washed away in the surging torrents .
and as the swollen waters of the river elbe continue to rise farther up north , so too could the costs of damage to germany ’ s national rail network , according to another deutsche bahn spokesman , hans-georg kusznir . deutsche bahn has now organised a crisis centre in dresden to estimate the precise scope of the damage . according to stauss , “ the worst damage has been done in saxony . ”
dresden , at the heart of saxony , is a crucial link in the central german railway network .
“ our main aim is to repair the main rail lines , in order to get the central german region back on track ” , the company said in a statement . the company 's highest priority is to repair the dresden-leipzig-chemnitz connection , a heavily frequented line in a highly industrial region in germany ’ s east . financing still unclear “ details on the financing of this work will have to be solved later ” , kusznir said .
however , funds for immediate repair have already been made available .
“ for the year 2002 the bahn has around 2.5 billion euro for investments in the current network , ” he said . deutsche bahn will make the flooded regions a priority in the distribution of these funds , he said . fears that planned projects , such as the modernisation of dresden ’ s 100-year-old station , will be neglected due to flood repairs , have been denied by deutsche bahn .
but some projects will inevitably have to be postponed . additionally , the german government has promised to help deutsche bahn where it can .
“ we will help the company ” , transport minister kurt bodewig , a social democrat , pledged on tuesday .
the government has already planned a record sum for the rail company in this year ’ s budget .
bodewig said one billion euro had been designated for the bahn both this and next year . years to repair total repair is expected to take at least until 2003 .
and deutsche bahn expects there will be additional damage to further regions , as the river elbe makes its way up north .
in addition , in areas where the water is already retreating , “ numerous railways and stations are still overflooded ” , according to achim stauss . in dresden , some of the first regional trains have started arriving and departing from the city ’ s main station , which had been cut off from service for days . for those tracks cut off by flood waters , deutsche bahn has set up a network of replacement buses .

the company announced in may that the fforestfach plant was to close after losing money for the last 18 months switching production of trousers and skirts instead to cheaper workforces in morocco .
as the 435 swansea workers completed their redundancy period , there was a glimmer of hope for them .
a £ 15m shopping complex creating around 500 jobs is opening for the first time to customers just yards away .
a former industrial site has been developed privately by the stadium group , and the existing tesco extra is being joined by other high street retail and restaurant names .
job creation the official opening of parc fforestffach was performed by welsh economic development minister andrew davies , with swansea city football players and club mascot cyril the swan also taking part .
the group says the retail park is creating more than 500 jobs , and some of them have been filled by those made redundant at the dewhirst factory .
however , as many of the positions at the retail park are part-time , workers from dewhirst who need full-time work were left facing a difficult future .
some wept as they left the factory for the last time .
news of the end of dewhirst 's swansea operation was swiftly followed last month by the announcement that its plant at cardigan was to finish production jeans for retail giant marks & spencer .
another 325 jobs in the small west wales town where the company is the main employer are due to go in november .
powerless the clothing manufacturer 's fortunes have been caught up with those of its principal buyer - m & s - which is only now recovering after a turbulent few years .
as well as the hundreds of job losses announced this year dewhirst has been retracting its operations across wales and the rest of the uk over the last four years .
it has meant the loss of well paid skilled jobs with the welsh assembly government saying it was powerless to intervene .
in 1998 , 300 jobs at the ystalyfera factory near swansea went .
a further 165 jobs were lost last year when the lampeter plant shut .
two years ago the company also close two of its factories in stoke-in-trent and on teesside in england .

the footage includes early shots of sellers with first wife and young family , and his parents , on family holidays .
much of it has never before been broadcast , and can be seen on arena the peter sellers story as he filmed it this saturday .
there are shots of spike milligan and the other goons , and an interview with spike ; plus clips of his early film work , on and off set .
breakfast spoke to the producer of arena - the peter sellers story , anthony wall and had a sneak preview at the arena programme " massive treasure trove " sellers obsessively shot the film throughout his career until the late seventies ... we came across fifteen hours of material , it was absolutely pristine clean , he cut it all himself in a post-production facility in a loft on professional editing equipment .
he 'd show it once to friends and family and then it would go back in the can and he 'd do another one .
sellers never felt he was in control of his life. he loved gadgets and was a professional photographer doing assignments for vogue .
he had an obsessive sense of fun , his capacity to inhabit another character was so utterly extraordinary .
this footage is so intimate and so personal it gives you a visual account of how he changes .
producer anthony wall was involved with making a series of three arena documentaries in 1995 .
he was asked to make a 90 minute version , but he decided that rather than just cut them down he would do something different , and use the original interviews , but with only pictures shot by sellers or under his direction .
' arena ' features sellers ' home movies the material was shot between 1948 and 1976 and represents an unbroken record of the private life of sellers .
it 's a unique resource , because it is such a long period and good quality - mostly shot on professional format 16mm , and edited by sellers in a massive loft .
he would have a screening at the time he edited it - but much of it was never looked at again and is in good condition .
sellers also asked anybody else filming him to give him a copy of their footage .
this went way beyond a hobby , and involved a great deal of care in setting up the shots .
the arena programme is told from his own point of view - the only bits he did n't shoot are three film clips and one from a documentary made about him .
sellers interviewed fellow goon spike milligan producer anthony wall is also interested in the spiral sellers ' life went into , the strange things he did , like walking out on the shooting of casino royale .
and there is the weird relationship with his mother , and a remark he made about having lost his relatives when his mother died - even though he had children living .
the documentary includes shots of those ho worked for him - his chauffeur and cook ; later holidays in the us , on yachts , at disneyland .
britt eckland to whom sellers was married for five years also gives a long interview .
wall admits the arena film was something of an experiment and he was trying to do something different .
it 's success lies in the fact that it draws you in and gives a rare insight into what sellers was really like .

the move is being seen as an attempt to head off a damaging trade war .
the concessions have been welcomed by the japanese government , which had set a deadline of the end of august to decide on what counter measures to take .
the european union has said it would appraise the us ' softened stance on friday , though it has until late september to decide whether to slap retaliatory sanctions on us products .
the tariffs were imposed in march in an attempt to protect the us steel industry .
but now nearly one quarter of imports covered by the original order are exempt from the tariffs .
japan 's deadline stands a japanese trade ministry official said about 70 % of japanese steel exports now fell outside the us tariffs net . "
we are crossing the threshold of whether the tariff will do the job that the administration and the industry agreed needed to be done " gary hubbard united steel workers of america union but , he added : " about 650,000 tonnes will still be affected and we are still assessing the matter . "
the trade minister has reportedly said talks with the us are due to continue .
the us has denied that its concessions were influenced by threats of retaliation from the european union and japan .
but us steelmakers already fear that the tariffs will no longer be effective .
no more exemptions ?
the administration of us president george w bush said the latest group of exclusions was the seventh and final group to be granted exemptions from the tariffs this year .
but it said it would in november allow steel customers to lodge requests for further exclusions .
since the beginning of june , the us has exempted a total of 727 products .
the products covered in this latest group covered a broad range of steel products , from plate and hot-rolled to tin mill and stainless .
conflicting concerns us steel producers have been worried that too many exclusions would undermine the effectiveness of the tariffs .
nancy gravatt , a spokeswoman for the american iron and steel institute , said steel producers were " disappointed at the large number of exclusions granted over industry objections " .
" we are crossing the threshold of whether the tariff will do the job that the administration and the industry agreed needed to be done , " gary hubbard , a spokesman for the united steel workers of america union , said .
but the country 's steel-consuming companies have complained that the tariffs have forced us steel prices to rise higher than expected .
balancing act the us trade representative 's office and the commerce department said the latest exclusions followed consultations with us steel consumers and producers , and foreign producers .
" this is part of the administration 's objective of providing relief only where needed in the steel industry , and to avoid burdening us steel consumers , " the statement said .
the full list of exclusions is on the us trade representative 's web site -lrb- see link above -rrb- .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- elvis : who is fit to fill his blue suede shoes ?
news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : talking point news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point forum - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk friday , 23 august , 2002 , 06:29 gmt 07:29 uk elvis : who is fit to fill his blue suede shoes ?
on the 25th anniversary of the death of singing legend elvis presley , millions of his fans across the world meet to celebrate his life and work .
elvis may have left the building but to his fans he is still and always will be the king .
however that position is not necessarily so secure .
young pretenders are waiting in the wings .
jerry lee lewis was famously arrested for waving a gun around outside of elvis ' graceland home shouting " i am the king " and chuck d of public enemy has revealed that he believes eminem is the new elvis .
do you think elvis was and remains the king ?
or has he been usurped ?
who do you think is the new king ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
i ca n't believe you 're even asking the question .
shakin ' stevens is the new elvis !
andy d , england his true value tends to be obscured by people worshipping him as a demi-god jeremy , uk it 's a bit unfair to pick up on elvis ' lack of song writing - should we run down the world 's greatest orchestras , conductors and soloists because they did n't write anything they play ?
interpretation is often as artistically important as creation and many songs were written with him in mind .
he was an important artist but his true value tends to be obscured sometimes by people with a hole to fill worshipping him as a demi-god .
jeremy , uk elvis definitely had something very special because as a result of the latest media coverage my six-year-old daughter has just become his latest fan and wants to buy his music !
dawn , england the record industry will not allow one person to be as popular as elvis andrew , uk the way the record industry works nowadays will not allow for one person to dominate the music era for so long , nor will it allow for one person to be as popular as elvis .
record labels exploit young artists for all they are worth , and drop them when they 've made their profit .
tracks are released to radio stations months before they are released to the public meaning it is only the tracks whose royalties are subsidised that get played .
how often is it that you hear a track from even five years ago on the radio ?
andrew , uk no one else looks good in a rhinestone jumpsuit .
wendy , uk elvis was the king .
then came the biggest ever king , michael jackson with the biggest albums , biggest tours , and greatest videos the world has ever seen .
these days the throne is empty , and i see no potential king .
nigel haig , england an original is truly irreplaceable gc jordahl , us the problem with an original is that it is truly irreplaceable .
elvis was not an incredible person , but an incredible performer .
if he had n't been , we would n't be having this conversation .
gc jordahl , us who else is famous enough to have a no.1 hit 25 years later ?
who else would have 40,000 + people paying tribute at graceland ?
those who want to knock such a marvellous person need to note this .
i doubt if some of these funny little bands these days will be remembered after a year , let alone 25 years .
diana goreham , england what 's all this about him not writing his own songs ?
neither did sinatra , caruso , callas or bing crosby , as far as i know : silly argument .
what people are not mentioning enough is elvis ' extraordinary voice , which was not only expressive but had an exceptional range , from almost a bass to a tenor , and it was equally at home with ballads or rock .
i ca n't think of anyone around today with the same vocal talent .
long live the king !
jane , italy elvis remains popular simply because his voice has a timeless quality about it heather duffield , uk the " old hat " music of elvis so typifies the morose weird and at times dark side of the southern states of america .
elvis was only the king in the minds of people with little understanding of culture .
mark , uk elvis remains popular simply because his voice has a timeless quality about it .
there has never , and will never , be anyone to be so universally enjoyed for their charisma and sheer talent .
tell me who else has such a long and loyal following across all the generations ?
and who will be remembered for so long by so many ?
heather duffield , uk there is nobody to replace elvis .
i did n't appreciate him when i was young , but now with all of the shouting , whining and shrieking we get from pop stars and groups , i realise what a fantastic voice elvis had .
he could sing anything from gospel to rock and roll .
pete compared the beatles with elvis .
they could not hold a candle to the king .
they were popular because they were four young lads .
i was from that era , they were something new .
they could n't sing too well , but some of their songs were quite catchy .
one sees more clearly with hindsight .
patricia , australia he is definitely not king anon , uk i think we need to remember that elvis died 25 years ago .
a lot has changed in that time in music so no he is definitely not king .
a lot of people also remember him from the 50s and 60s , not how he was when he died , ruined due to drugs .
very sad but the all night vigil was over the top , time moves on .
anon , uk elvis : the king of a particular beat generation , the kerouac of rock music .
tommaso debenedetti , italy elvis is more than the music , he inspired radical change in youth culture .
he broke down racial bigotry in america -lrb- indeed the western world -rrb- .
to equal that is difficult today , perhaps the closest anyone could come to this today would be a gay / lesbian artist becoming the highest selling artist in the world due to the new music genre they have created !
elvis was a one off .
shaun lavelle , ireland oh puh-lease .
move on people dan halford , new zealand -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- he was a pretty white boy who could sing black music .
he did n't break down racial barriers .
that was purely an unexpected by-product .
he lived by dint of his hip-wriggling .
the kitsch-obsessed nostalgia-loving people who acclaim him today are just templates for those types who will be acclaiming westlife in 30 years time .
the king ?
oh puh-lease .
move on people .
dan halford , new zealand -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- elvis is still king as his recent chart hit implies .
he was a fabulously one off gifted singer , only the beatles could match him and there were four of them !
pete , uk you 're misinterpreting what chuck d said about eminem tristan o 'dwyer , uk the chances are that you 're misinterpreting what chuck d said about eminem being the new elvis .
he probably meant that a style of music pioneered by black people remains underground and denigrated by white society until a white person comes along and makes out to be the " king " of that style .
all of a sudden white america decides it actually likes that music and treats that person as " the king " .
simply replace rock 'n'roll with hip-hop and elvis with eminem .
the only difference of course is that eminem is actually very talented ; he points out the fact that hip-hop was around much before him .
tristan o 'dwyer , uk the new king has to be robbie williams .
and he should also be the new bond .
annie , austria the guy was unoriginal and stole the work of musical giants without once acknowledging it .
the man quite definitely is n't and never was the king of rock and roll .
vish , uk elvis was the gareth gates of his day dougal mckinnon , uk elvis was the gareth gates of his day - a pretty white face mass marketed as the acceptable face of rock and roll , at a time when a host of other artists were doing the same thing , but better .
a few of his songs -lrb- written by others -rrb- are rightly remembered as classics , but they are more than outweighed by the dozens of awful records , the atrocious films and the cringe-inducing white jumpsuit era .
dougal mckinnon , uk i do a mean suspicious minds at my local karaoke so i 'm guessing ... me ?
barry , uk elvis was in a lot of rubbish movies and made some other dubious decisions , but you can hardly blame him , then since he was the first star of that magnitude and did n't have anyone who looked after him , unlike today 's pop hopefuls .
i doubt whether anyone will still be talking about darius in 25 years .
the louisiana hayride albums and the movie king creole is the kind of stuff that made him the king of rock and roll .
edmor , london , uk edmor , i pledge to you today that i will be talking about darius in 25 years -lrb- and i 'll put a note in my diary to remind myself -rrb- .
andy d , england it 's wrong to make him out as a saint catherine , uk the way some of you talk about elvis you 'd think that he solved world hunger , and stopped all wars .
at the end of the day he was a singer / actor .
he did n't do much for humanity so it 's wrong to make him out as a saint .
other people died in the same year as presley who worked all their lives for freedom .
men like steve biko who was murdered by prison guards in september 1977 and yet we remember a man who in the end was overweight and greedy .
i do not see the point .
catherine , uk i think the new king will be prince william .
chris , england i 've never understood what people like about him .
but then again , i 've never understood what anyone likes about george bush , either .
peter nelson , usa america started producing pop idols because it had no royal family kostia , russia apart from his wiggling sexual appeal , elvis was every bit as manufactured as britney .
he was n't an artist .
he was n't there to sing .
he was there to be adored and wanted .
what else is a king for anyway ?
i have a strong suspicion that america started producing pop idols because it had no royal family to gossip about .
the brits know the secret : why bother with all this singing business when princess diana was worshipped simply because she was on the top ?
kostia , russia if it was up to the critics , elvis would have been history back in the 50s .
the reason there will never be another elvis is because he was a phenomenon made by ordinary people like me who fell in love with the honesty and emotion in his voice .
that 's the real reason why his legacy endures .
gillian , new zealand he is the man , the one and only debbie , usa there never has and never will be but one king of rock and roll and that is elvis presley .
he is the man , the one and only and elvis if you are alive we love you and miss you terribly !
elvis come home !
debbie , usa it 's not even that the king was that great , but all the kitsch , eccentricity and showmanship of his character make him accessible to cynics as well as blind followers .
robbie williams desperately begs us to let him entertain us , elvis did that with a little shake of the hips .
i 'd rather watch an elvis impersonator in a pub in february than pay absurd amounts to watch oasis in finsbury park in the summer .
ed k , uk if elvis is n't the king , name me the entertainer who will still be able to attract 75,000 people to their burial site 25 years after their death !
paul p , usa i always found buddy holly 's music a lot better .
if i had to crown anyone king -lrb- which i would n't , because i 'm not a royalist -rrb- it would be tom waits ...
mark , scotland / holland he was the first manufactured pop idol nb , canada i do n't see much difference between elvis and the pop idol manufactured stuff .
he was the first manufactured pop idol .
he was successful because he made it okay for white america to listen to black people 's music .
nb , canada elvis opened the door to rock 'n'roll .
no one can change that .
he is and always will be the king .
diane hall , usa i always preferred george formby .
morris , england elvis was merely an early part of the continuing trend of manufactured bands and singers .
he could hardly string a sentence together , could n't act and certainly could n't sing .
i do n't understand what all the fuss is about .
who would fill his shoes ?
who would want to , more like ? !
tina , uk he was a young , driven , slightly dangerous and exciting equivalent of frank sinatra andrew , usa i think people are overlooking his cultural significance by saying that he did n't write his own songs , or that it was derivative pop .
when elvis was working with sam philips at sun records , he was involved with one of the most revolutionary musical movements of the 20th century .
after his move to rca , elvis became the world 's first rock star .
elvis was not a writer , he did not strive to make artistic statements .
he was a young , driven , slightly dangerous and exciting equivalent of frank sinatra and other performers that dominated an era immediately before his ascension .
andrew , usa those who categorise elvis as overrated and not up to the standards of today 's pop stars are the same people who would watch the classic film king kong and complain that the monkey is n't very believable .
back in the thirties moviegoers were fainting in the aisles upon seeing kong and back in the fifties young girls had never seen the likes of elvis the pelvis .
long live the king .
bob , usa his comeback on nbc in 1968 remains the template for all other live performances .
his charisma and appeal still remains today .
james , uk that 's a real silly question .
who could possibly fill his shoes ?
elvis the king ?
yes !
forever .
sue , uk nowadays there is nothing new and there is nobody who could inspire a whole generation amy , uk i agree with sue , nobody could replace elvis because he was the start of something new and explosive - a style of music and performing that the world had never seen .
he literally took people 's breath away .
nowadays there is nothing new and there is nobody who could inspire a whole generation .
look at the people that make it to number one - will , gareth and darius and if watching them makes you excited , elated and moved you really need to start worrying !
elvis will always be the king and there could never be another amy , uk he was and always will be the king - at a time when the throne was vacant .
now , as a result of his influence , we have a multitude of princes and pretenders -lrb- no disrespect to those two artists , but they have n't got his wiggle or his grin ! -rrb-
caro , uk good vocal ability , poor enunciation , laughable wardrobe , abysmal actor .
the king ?
get a life !
chris , uk the simple answer is that nobody could fill elvis ' shoes .
he was the greatest singer / entertainer ever .
he broke down so many negative racial and cultural barriers in 1950 's usa and we all owe him a debt for that alone .
when one throws out all the negative jibes it is talent that wins through in the end .
he had it in abundance .
long live the king .
may he rest in peace .
brian quinn , england elvis lives ! !
therefore he must still be the king ! !
alex , uk who is elvis anyway ?
elvis costello ?
anthony , london i play his music , sing his songs , his style of music will never die ; i have done since the 1960s .
keep on rocking .
long live the king .
martyn lewis , england in the 25 years since he died , nobody has come even close to equalling him .
i doubt anyone will .
elvis was unique .
the only way someone could compete is if they cloned him .
jeff smithiee , uk zero song writing ability , could just about strum a few chords on a guitar , and made some of the most hideous films of all-time .
made some decent stuff before he was drafted , but 95 % of his stuff after that is utter bilge .
dominated / ripped off by his manager and died on the toilet .
the king ? nah !
andy shanks , england why should anybody try to fill his shoes ?
any rock or pop star who had enough talent and presence to be able to do that should be strong enough to forge their own identity without having to try to copy anyone else .
pete hazell , uk madonna comes closest ed karten , uk in terms of success , appeal and iconic status and ability to re-invent oneself , i think madonna comes closest to elvis .
eminem looks a bit pudgy already , so i do n't know whether he 'd be a contender for the , erm , throne .
ed karten , uk there is only one , and will only ever be one elvis presley .
nobody will come close .
tim , england what a strange question .
love him or hate him , elvis was unique .
david , england did he not just stand there in silly clothes singing other people 's songs , arranged and possibly even chosen for him by other people ?
ian , uk what crown 's this ?
elvis was a breakthrough artist , but once rock 'n'roll took off there are thousands of people and groups who have made much better music .
good looking and charismatic he may have been , in the early days anyway , but is the music really that good ?
how many of his songs did he and his band -lrb- if he had one -rrb- write ?
did he not just stand there in silly clothes singing other people 's songs , arranged and possibly even chosen for him by other people ?
usually songs for wimps and weenyboppers at that !
a clear case of the herd mentality overriding taste in decent rock music .
ian , uk there will always be new rock legends but there will always be only one elvis presley .

do you think elvis was and remains the king ?
or has he been usurped ?
who do you think is the new king ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
i ca n't believe you 're even asking the question .
shakin ' stevens is the new elvis !
andy d , england his true value tends to be obscured by people worshipping him as a demi-god jeremy , uk it 's a bit unfair to pick up on elvis ' lack of song writing - should we run down the world 's greatest orchestras , conductors and soloists because they did n't write anything they play ?
interpretation is often as artistically important as creation and many songs were written with him in mind .
he was an important artist but his true value tends to be obscured sometimes by people with a hole to fill worshipping him as a demi-god .
jeremy , uk elvis definitely had something very special because as a result of the latest media coverage my six-year-old daughter has just become his latest fan and wants to buy his music !
dawn , england the record industry will not allow one person to be as popular as elvis andrew , uk the way the record industry works nowadays will not allow for one person to dominate the music era for so long , nor will it allow for one person to be as popular as elvis .
record labels exploit young artists for all they are worth , and drop them when they 've made their profit .
tracks are released to radio stations months before they are released to the public meaning it is only the tracks whose royalties are subsidised that get played .
how often is it that you hear a track from even five years ago on the radio ?
andrew , uk no one else looks good in a rhinestone jumpsuit .
wendy , uk elvis was the king .
then came the biggest ever king , michael jackson with the biggest albums , biggest tours , and greatest videos the world has ever seen .
these days the throne is empty , and i see no potential king .
nigel haig , england an original is truly irreplaceable gc jordahl , us the problem with an original is that it is truly irreplaceable .
elvis was not an incredible person , but an incredible performer .
if he had n't been , we would n't be having this conversation .
gc jordahl , us who else is famous enough to have a no.1 hit 25 years later ?
who else would have 40,000 + people paying tribute at graceland ?
those who want to knock such a marvellous person need to note this .
i doubt if some of these funny little bands these days will be remembered after a year , let alone 25 years .
diana goreham , england what 's all this about him not writing his own songs ?
neither did sinatra , caruso , callas or bing crosby , as far as i know : silly argument .
what people are not mentioning enough is elvis ' extraordinary voice , which was not only expressive but had an exceptional range , from almost a bass to a tenor , and it was equally at home with ballads or rock .
i ca n't think of anyone around today with the same vocal talent .
long live the king !
jane , italy elvis remains popular simply because his voice has a timeless quality about it heather duffield , uk the " old hat " music of elvis so typifies the morose weird and at times dark side of the southern states of america .
elvis was only the king in the minds of people with little understanding of culture .
mark , uk elvis remains popular simply because his voice has a timeless quality about it .
there has never , and will never , be anyone to be so universally enjoyed for their charisma and sheer talent .
tell me who else has such a long and loyal following across all the generations ?
and who will be remembered for so long by so many ?
heather duffield , uk there is nobody to replace elvis .
i did n't appreciate him when i was young , but now with all of the shouting , whining and shrieking we get from pop stars and groups , i realise what a fantastic voice elvis had .
he could sing anything from gospel to rock and roll .
pete compared the beatles with elvis .
they could not hold a candle to the king .
they were popular because they were four young lads .
i was from that era , they were something new .
they could n't sing too well , but some of their songs were quite catchy .
one sees more clearly with hindsight .
patricia , australia he is definitely not king anon , uk i think we need to remember that elvis died 25 years ago .
a lot has changed in that time in music so no he is definitely not king .
a lot of people also remember him from the 50s and 60s , not how he was when he died , ruined due to drugs .
very sad but the all night vigil was over the top , time moves on .
anon , uk elvis : the king of a particular beat generation , the kerouac of rock music .
tommaso debenedetti , italy elvis is more than the music , he inspired radical change in youth culture .
he broke down racial bigotry in america -lrb- indeed the western world -rrb- .
to equal that is difficult today , perhaps the closest anyone could come to this today would be a gay / lesbian artist becoming the highest selling artist in the world due to the new music genre they have created !
elvis was a one off .
shaun lavelle , ireland oh puh-lease .
move on people dan halford , new zealand -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- he was a pretty white boy who could sing black music .
he did n't break down racial barriers .
that was purely an unexpected by-product .
he lived by dint of his hip-wriggling .
the kitsch-obsessed nostalgia-loving people who acclaim him today are just templates for those types who will be acclaiming westlife in 30 years time .
the king ?
oh puh-lease .
move on people .
dan halford , new zealand -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- elvis is still king as his recent chart hit implies .
he was a fabulously one off gifted singer , only the beatles could match him and there were four of them !
pete , uk you 're misinterpreting what chuck d said about eminem tristan o 'dwyer , uk the chances are that you 're misinterpreting what chuck d said about eminem being the new elvis .
he probably meant that a style of music pioneered by black people remains underground and denigrated by white society until a white person comes along and makes out to be the " king " of that style .
all of a sudden white america decides it actually likes that music and treats that person as " the king " .
simply replace rock 'n'roll with hip-hop and elvis with eminem .
the only difference of course is that eminem is actually very talented ; he points out the fact that hip-hop was around much before him .
tristan o 'dwyer , uk the new king has to be robbie williams .
and he should also be the new bond .
annie , austria the guy was unoriginal and stole the work of musical giants without once acknowledging it .
the man quite definitely is n't and never was the king of rock and roll .
vish , uk elvis was the gareth gates of his day dougal mckinnon , uk elvis was the gareth gates of his day - a pretty white face mass marketed as the acceptable face of rock and roll , at a time when a host of other artists were doing the same thing , but better .
a few of his songs -lrb- written by others -rrb- are rightly remembered as classics , but they are more than outweighed by the dozens of awful records , the atrocious films and the cringe-inducing white jumpsuit era .
dougal mckinnon , uk i do a mean suspicious minds at my local karaoke so i 'm guessing ... me ?
barry , uk elvis was in a lot of rubbish movies and made some other dubious decisions , but you can hardly blame him , then since he was the first star of that magnitude and did n't have anyone who looked after him , unlike today 's pop hopefuls .
i doubt whether anyone will still be talking about darius in 25 years .
the louisiana hayride albums and the movie king creole is the kind of stuff that made him the king of rock and roll .
edmor , london , uk edmor , i pledge to you today that i will be talking about darius in 25 years -lrb- and i 'll put a note in my diary to remind myself -rrb- .
andy d , england it 's wrong to make him out as a saint catherine , uk the way some of you talk about elvis you 'd think that he solved world hunger , and stopped all wars .
at the end of the day he was a singer / actor .
he did n't do much for humanity so it 's wrong to make him out as a saint .
other people died in the same year as presley who worked all their lives for freedom .
men like steve biko who was murdered by prison guards in september 1977 and yet we remember a man who in the end was overweight and greedy .
i do not see the point .
catherine , uk i think the new king will be prince william .
chris , england i 've never understood what people like about him .
but then again , i 've never understood what anyone likes about george bush , either .
peter nelson , usa america started producing pop idols because it had no royal family kostia , russia apart from his wiggling sexual appeal , elvis was every bit as manufactured as britney .
he was n't an artist .
he was n't there to sing .
he was there to be adored and wanted .
what else is a king for anyway ?
i have a strong suspicion that america started producing pop idols because it had no royal family to gossip about .
the brits know the secret : why bother with all this singing business when princess diana was worshipped simply because she was on the top ?
kostia , russia if it was up to the critics , elvis would have been history back in the 50s .
the reason there will never be another elvis is because he was a phenomenon made by ordinary people like me who fell in love with the honesty and emotion in his voice .
that 's the real reason why his legacy endures .
gillian , new zealand he is the man , the one and only debbie , usa there never has and never will be but one king of rock and roll and that is elvis presley .
he is the man , the one and only and elvis if you are alive we love you and miss you terribly !
elvis come home !
debbie , usa it 's not even that the king was that great , but all the kitsch , eccentricity and showmanship of his character make him accessible to cynics as well as blind followers .
robbie williams desperately begs us to let him entertain us , elvis did that with a little shake of the hips .
i 'd rather watch an elvis impersonator in a pub in february than pay absurd amounts to watch oasis in finsbury park in the summer .
ed k , uk if elvis is n't the king , name me the entertainer who will still be able to attract 75,000 people to their burial site 25 years after their death !
paul p , usa i always found buddy holly 's music a lot better .
if i had to crown anyone king -lrb- which i would n't , because i 'm not a royalist -rrb- it would be tom waits ...
mark , scotland / holland he was the first manufactured pop idol nb , canada i do n't see much difference between elvis and the pop idol manufactured stuff .
he was the first manufactured pop idol .
he was successful because he made it okay for white america to listen to black people 's music .
nb , canada elvis opened the door to rock 'n'roll .
no one can change that .
he is and always will be the king .
diane hall , usa i always preferred george formby .
morris , england elvis was merely an early part of the continuing trend of manufactured bands and singers .
he could hardly string a sentence together , could n't act and certainly could n't sing .
i do n't understand what all the fuss is about .
who would fill his shoes ?
who would want to , more like ? !
tina , uk he was a young , driven , slightly dangerous and exciting equivalent of frank sinatra andrew , usa i think people are overlooking his cultural significance by saying that he did n't write his own songs , or that it was derivative pop .
when elvis was working with sam philips at sun records , he was involved with one of the most revolutionary musical movements of the 20th century .
after his move to rca , elvis became the world 's first rock star .
elvis was not a writer , he did not strive to make artistic statements .
he was a young , driven , slightly dangerous and exciting equivalent of frank sinatra and other performers that dominated an era immediately before his ascension .
andrew , usa those who categorise elvis as overrated and not up to the standards of today 's pop stars are the same people who would watch the classic film king kong and complain that the monkey is n't very believable .
back in the thirties moviegoers were fainting in the aisles upon seeing kong and back in the fifties young girls had never seen the likes of elvis the pelvis .
long live the king .
bob , usa his comeback on nbc in 1968 remains the template for all other live performances .
his charisma and appeal still remains today .
james , uk that 's a real silly question .
who could possibly fill his shoes ?
elvis the king ?
yes !
forever .
sue , uk nowadays there is nothing new and there is nobody who could inspire a whole generation amy , uk i agree with sue , nobody could replace elvis because he was the start of something new and explosive - a style of music and performing that the world had never seen .
he literally took people 's breath away .
nowadays there is nothing new and there is nobody who could inspire a whole generation .
look at the people that make it to number one - will , gareth and darius and if watching them makes you excited , elated and moved you really need to start worrying !
elvis will always be the king and there could never be another amy , uk he was and always will be the king - at a time when the throne was vacant .
now , as a result of his influence , we have a multitude of princes and pretenders -lrb- no disrespect to those two artists , but they have n't got his wiggle or his grin ! -rrb-
caro , uk good vocal ability , poor enunciation , laughable wardrobe , abysmal actor .
the king ?
get a life !
chris , uk the simple answer is that nobody could fill elvis ' shoes .
he was the greatest singer / entertainer ever .
he broke down so many negative racial and cultural barriers in 1950 's usa and we all owe him a debt for that alone .
when one throws out all the negative jibes it is talent that wins through in the end .
he had it in abundance .
long live the king .
may he rest in peace .
brian quinn , england elvis lives ! !
therefore he must still be the king ! !
alex , uk who is elvis anyway ?
elvis costello ?
anthony , london i play his music , sing his songs , his style of music will never die ; i have done since the 1960s .
keep on rocking .
long live the king .
martyn lewis , england in the 25 years since he died , nobody has come even close to equalling him .
i doubt anyone will .
elvis was unique .
the only way someone could compete is if they cloned him .
jeff smithiee , uk zero song writing ability , could just about strum a few chords on a guitar , and made some of the most hideous films of all-time .
made some decent stuff before he was drafted , but 95 % of his stuff after that is utter bilge .
dominated / ripped off by his manager and died on the toilet .
the king ? nah !
andy shanks , england why should anybody try to fill his shoes ?
any rock or pop star who had enough talent and presence to be able to do that should be strong enough to forge their own identity without having to try to copy anyone else .
pete hazell , uk madonna comes closest ed karten , uk in terms of success , appeal and iconic status and ability to re-invent oneself , i think madonna comes closest to elvis .
eminem looks a bit pudgy already , so i do n't know whether he 'd be a contender for the , erm , throne .
ed karten , uk there is only one , and will only ever be one elvis presley .
nobody will come close .
tim , england what a strange question .
love him or hate him , elvis was unique .
david , england did he not just stand there in silly clothes singing other people 's songs , arranged and possibly even chosen for him by other people ?
ian , uk what crown 's this ?
elvis was a breakthrough artist , but once rock 'n'roll took off there are thousands of people and groups who have made much better music .
good looking and charismatic he may have been , in the early days anyway , but is the music really that good ?
how many of his songs did he and his band -lrb- if he had one -rrb- write ?
did he not just stand there in silly clothes singing other people 's songs , arranged and possibly even chosen for him by other people ?
usually songs for wimps and weenyboppers at that !
a clear case of the herd mentality overriding taste in decent rock music .
ian , uk there will always be new rock legends but there will always be only one elvis presley .
t.j. cassidy , u.s.a. at his best and worse , he was never average steve , uk elvis is the original real deal .
he was an imitable one off who shook the world .
you ca n't replace that .
even artists as diverse as eminem -lrb- " though i 'm not the first king of controversy , i am the worst thing since elvis presley . " -rrb- and john lennon -lrb- " before elvis there was nothing " -rrb- acknowledge this ...

vish , uk " elvis was the gareth gates of his day " dougal mckinnon , uk elvis was the gareth gates of his day - a pretty white face mass marketed as the acceptable face of rock and roll , at a time when a host of other artists were doing the same thing , but better .
a few of his songs -lrb- written by others -rrb- are rightly remembered as classics , but they are more than outweighed by the dozens of awful records , the atrocious films and the cringe-inducing white jumpsuit era .
dougal mckinnon , uk i do a mean suspicious minds at my local karaoke so i 'm guessing ... me ?
barry , uk elvis was in a lot of rubbish movies and made some other dubious decisions , but you can hardly blame him , then since he was the first star of that magnitude and did n't have anyone who looked after him , unlike today 's pop hopefuls .
i doubt whether anyone will still be talking about darius in 25 years .
the louisiana hayride albums and the movie king creole is the kind of stuff that made him the king of rock and roll .
edmor , london , uk edmor , i pledge to you today that i will be talking about darius in 25 years -lrb- and i 'll put a note in my diary to remind myself -rrb- .
andy d , england " it 's wrong to make him out as a saint " catherine , uk the way some of you talk about elvis you 'd think that he solved world hunger , and stopped all wars .
at the end of the day he was a singer / actor .
he did n't do much for humanity so it 's wrong to make him out as a saint .
other people died in the same year as presley who worked all their lives for freedom .
men like steve biko who was murdered by prison guards in september 1977 and yet we remember a man who in the end was overweight and greedy .
i do not see the point .
catherine , uk i think the new king will be prince william .
chris , england i 've never understood what people like about him .
but then again , i 've never understood what anyone likes about george bush , either .
peter nelson , usa " america started producing pop idols because it had no royal family " kostia , russia apart from his wiggling sexual appeal , elvis was every bit as manufactured as britney .
he was n't an artist .
he was n't there to sing .
he was there to be adored and wanted .
what else is a king for anyway ?
i have a strong suspicion that america started producing pop idols because it had no royal family to gossip about .
the brits know the secret : why bother with all this singing business when princess diana was worshipped simply because she was on the top ?
kostia , russia if it was up to the critics , elvis would have been history back in the 50s .
the reason there will never be another elvis is because he was a phenomenon made by ordinary people like me who fell in love with the honesty and emotion in his voice .
that 's the real reason why his legacy endures .
gillian , new zealand " he is the man , the one and only " debbie , usa there never has and never will be but one king of rock and roll and that is elvis presley .
he is the man , the one and only and elvis if you are alive we love you and miss you terribly !
elvis come home !
debbie , usa it 's not even that the king was that great , but all the kitsch , eccentricity and showmanship of his character make him accessible to cynics as well as blind followers .
robbie williams desperately begs us to let him entertain us , elvis did that with a little shake of the hips .
i 'd rather watch an elvis impersonator in a pub in february than pay absurd amounts to watch oasis in finsbury park in the summer .
ed k , uk if elvis is n't the king , name me the entertainer who will still be able to attract 75,000 people to their burial site 25 years after their death !
paul p , usa i always found buddy holly 's music a lot better .
if i had to crown anyone king -lrb- which i would n't , because i 'm not a royalist -rrb- it would be tom waits ...
mark , scotland / holland " he was the first manufactured pop idol " nb , canada i do n't see much difference between elvis and the pop idol manufactured stuff .
he was the first manufactured pop idol .
he was successful because he made it okay for white america to listen to black people 's music .
nb , canada elvis opened the door to rock 'n'roll .
no one can change that .
he is and always will be the king .
diane hall , usa i always preferred george formby .
morris , england elvis was merely an early part of the continuing trend of manufactured bands and singers .
he could hardly string a sentence together , could n't act and certainly could n't sing .
i do n't understand what all the fuss is about .
who would fill his shoes ?
who would want to , more like ? !
tina , uk " he was a young , driven , slightly dangerous and exciting equivalent of frank sinatra " andrew , usa i think people are overlooking his cultural significance by saying that he did n't write his own songs , or that it was derivative pop .
when elvis was working with sam philips at sun records , he was involved with one of the most revolutionary musical movements of the 20th century .
after his move to rca , elvis became the world 's first rock star .
elvis was not a writer , he did not strive to make artistic statements .
he was a young , driven , slightly dangerous and exciting equivalent of frank sinatra and other performers that dominated an era immediately before his ascension .
andrew , usa those who categorise elvis as overrated and not up to the standards of today 's pop stars are the same people who would watch the classic film king kong and complain that the monkey is n't very believable .
back in the thirties moviegoers were fainting in the aisles upon seeing kong and back in the fifties young girls had never seen the likes of elvis the pelvis .
long live the king .
bob , usa his comeback on nbc in 1968 remains the template for all other live performances .
his charisma and appeal still remains today .
james , uk that 's a real silly question .
who could possibly fill his shoes ?
elvis the king ?
yes !
forever .
sue , uk " nowadays there is nothing new and there is nobody who could inspire a whole generation " amy , uk i agree with sue , nobody could replace elvis because he was the start of something new and explosive - a style of music and performing that the world had never seen .
he literally took people 's breath away .
nowadays there is nothing new and there is nobody who could inspire a whole generation .
look at the people that make it to number one - will , gareth and darius and if watching them makes you excited , elated and moved you really need to start worrying !
elvis will always be the king and there could never be another amy , uk he was and always will be the king - at a time when the throne was vacant .
now , as a result of his influence , we have a multitude of princes and pretenders -lrb- no disrespect to those two artists , but they have n't got his wiggle or his grin ! -rrb-
caro , uk good vocal ability , poor enunciation , laughable wardrobe , abysmal actor .
the king ?
get a life !
chris , uk the simple answer is that nobody could fill elvis ' shoes .
he was the greatest singer / entertainer ever .
he broke down so many negative racial and cultural barriers in 1950 's usa and we all owe him a debt for that alone .
when one throws out all the negative jibes it is talent that wins through in the end .
he had it in abundance .
long live the king .
may he rest in peace .
brian quinn , england elvis lives ! !
therefore he must still be the king ! !
alex , uk who is elvis anyway ?
elvis costello ?
anthony , london i play his music , sing his songs , his style of music will never die ; i have done since the 1960s .
keep on rocking .
long live the king .
martyn lewis , england in the 25 years since he died , nobody has come even close to equalling him .
i doubt anyone will .
elvis was unique .
the only way someone could compete is if they cloned him .
jeff smithiee , uk zero song writing ability , could just about strum a few chords on a guitar , and made some of the most hideous films of all-time .
made some decent stuff before he was drafted , but 95 % of his stuff after that is utter bilge .
dominated / ripped off by his manager and died on the toilet .
the king ? nah !
andy shanks , england why should anybody try to fill his shoes ?
any rock or pop star who had enough talent and presence to be able to do that should be strong enough to forge their own identity without having to try to copy anyone else .
pete hazell , uk " madonna comes closest " ed karten , uk in terms of success , appeal and iconic status and ability to re-invent oneself , i think madonna comes closest to elvis .
eminem looks a bit pudgy already , so i do n't know whether he 'd be a contender for the , erm , throne .
ed karten , uk there is only one , and will only ever be one elvis presley .
nobody will come close .
tim , england what a strange question .
love him or hate him , elvis was unique .
david , england " did he not just stand there in silly clothes singing other people 's songs , arranged and possibly even chosen for him by other people ? "
ian , uk what crown 's this ?
elvis was a breakthrough artist , but once rock 'n'roll took off there are thousands of people and groups who have made much better music .
good looking and charismatic he may have been , in the early days anyway , but is the music really that good ?
how many of his songs did he and his band -lrb- if he had one -rrb- write ?
did he not just stand there in silly clothes singing other people 's songs , arranged and possibly even chosen for him by other people ?
usually songs for wimps and weenyboppers at that !
a clear case of the herd mentality overriding taste in decent rock music .
ian , uk there will always be new rock legends but there will always be only one elvis presley .
t.j. cassidy , u.s.a. "
at his best and worse , he was never average " steve , uk elvis is the original real deal .
he was an imitable one off who shook the world .
you ca n't replace that .
even artists as diverse as eminem -lrb- " though i 'm not the first king of controversy , i am the worst thing since elvis presley . " -rrb- and john lennon -lrb- " before elvis there was nothing " -rrb- acknowledge this ...
at his best and worse , he was never average .
in this pop idol era it would be great to clone the king so he could karate chop will young and kung-fu kick gareth gates back into much deserved obscurity !
steve , uk , elvis is dead ? ! ? !
but i saw him the other week working in my local chip shop .
martin , england " my friends and i believe elvis will come back and save us from this mass-marketed pop nonsense ! "
max , england elvis will always be the king of rock and roll .
all this manufactured rubbish that 's about these days just does n't compare ...
my friends and i believe elvis will come back and save us from this mass-marketed pop nonsense !
max , england i was n't even born when elvis died but i have become a huge fan .
he bought a certain spark to the world , just walking on stage and the whole place lit up !
his voice and performances have been unsurpassed .
no-one will ever be able to outshine elvis .
he gave of himself every step of the way and it killed him .
to me there 's only one elvis presley !
sarah , harpenden , uk i am too young to remember elvis , but from what i see and hear of him it is my opinion that he was overrated .
nowadays there really has n't been anybody who has dominated the music scene as i imagine he did , but i would nominate madonna for the queen 's position .

bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point talking point contents : forum friday , 23 august , 2002 , 06:31 gmt 07:31 uk is debt discouraging you from studying ?
students who gained record a-level grades this week can expect to face up to £ 15,000 of debt when they finish university .
by 2010 the government wants half of all under-30s to take a degree - seven times the proportion in the 1960s .
not many school leavers have a realistic concept of the expense of going to university : a survey by goldfish says nearly 20 % had no clue how much food costs .
a degree improves career and financial prospects in the long-term and graduates are twice as likely to be promoted at work and go on holiday abroad , says the government .
but some now believe that high levels of debt is making access to higher education " exclusive " - and putting many people off .
is debt discouraging you from studying ?
what can students do to help themselves ?
how should the government help ?
how easy have you found it to pay off your debts after graduating ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below . "
we viewed it as much better to save up for something " john , england when i went to university in 1990 , i came from a family that did not live on debt .
we viewed it as much better to save up for something , and wait until we could afford it .
if it had n't been for the grant available , i simply could n't have afforded university , and would n't have gone .
without the degree , i 'd have been much less useful to our country in my working life .
john , england after the age of 18 , you are supposed to be an adult , free to choose your own path and take full responsibility .
what on earth has it got to do with your parents whether you get support or not with further education ?
grow up , get on with your lives , make hard choices about investing in education or not , learn to cope with financial pressures and get on with it .
welcome to the real world !
stephen , uk i would like to train as a nurse , but the £ 5,000 will not be enough to support my family .
if the government needed nurses that much they would do all they could to help those of us get into the training without worrying about debt .
i am in two minds at the moment .
rachel , uk " if any foreign company offers me money , i 'm off " vish , uk i graduated with £ 30k worth of debt , which will take until i am 35 to clear .
do n't expect me to be grateful to this country / government for my education .
if any foreign company offers me money , i 'm off .
vish , uk i do n't understand the government 's obsession with getting 50 % of people to study for a degree .
the degree is now devalued and commonplace - many graduates will still end up with lowly paid admin jobs that 20 years ago you could 've done with a couple of o-levels .
they will be in debt until middle age .
i would strongly advise young people today to get into a trade or job early .
that way you have 3-5 years more work experience and if you 're careful no crippling debt when you compare yourself to your peers who carried on to university and got worthless degrees in art history or sociology .
carol child , uk i say bring back the grants and give those poor students a chance to enjoy life - i 'd happily pay an extra penny in the pound tax to support them .
better spent on students than on stupid domes or fountains for diana .
anon , uk " remember - it 's not your money " alex banks , uk i graduated with £ 4,220 debt - i was the last of the grant students and had no tuition fees , but i had a part time bar job and did n't go clubbing three times a week nor did i buy m & s instant meals .
i paid my debt in just over 18 months .
a word of warning to any students about to go to university - take out whatever overdraft or loan you want , but remember - it 's not your money .
the bank is throwing that money at you now , but you will have to pay that back .
alex banks , uk " the people most at risk from debt are those whose degrees were undertaken simply for the university experience " chris , uk a university education should place you in a position to effectively deal with the debts which result from it .
like anything else , it is an investment , and if made wisely it will pay off - the people most at risk from debt are those whose degrees were undertaken simply for the university experience or with no real direction .
-lrb- incidentally , my university education was wholly funded by loans ! -rrb- .
chris , uk many people are quite prepared to get tens of thousands in debt to buy a car or even hundreds of thousands in debt to buy a house but not a few thousand to get an education which vastly improves the quality of life !
why is this ?
tom , uk what i object to is having a loan in my name but based on my parent 's income .
nowhere else do such crazy rules apply .
parental income often bears little resemblance to parental contribution .
let students stand on their own two feet , give all students access to bigger loans and finally there will be equality of opportunity .
grants based on parental income are not the answer .
jonathan rose , england in less than a month , i 'll start my uni life in portsmouth .
the first thing that 'll greet me there is a cheque for over £ 1,000 .
i intend to keep hold of that money for as long as i can which is why i have already arranged a job in the local bowling alley .
i will still end up in debt , but hopefully not as much as some as i 've seen many friends fritter away their loans on cds and clothes .
simon grey , southampton , uk i went to university several years ago and within a year was in debt to a level sufficient enough for me to drop out and start work .
i want to go back to university but the financial implications make it nearly impossible .
grants should be returned so that students can go without having to worry about living in debt for 10 years after they graduate .
kobe , wales " i was forced out of university after year two due to imminent financial disaster " john , england i am in a similar situation to kobe from wales .
i was forced out of university after year two due to imminent financial disaster .
i am still paying off the student loans .
i am completing the degree , however , with the open university , which allows me to work full time .
i could have been helped if the employers of this country were to become more flexible about working hours .
if they did , not only would more people be able to go back to studying , buy the rush hour congestion may be relieved as well !
john , england like kobe , i too dropped out of university to get a job .
unfortunately it was in the third year , so i have to work as a temp on abysmal wages , and am still saddled with these debts .
i 'd like to go back and pick up where i left off , but i find that i 'm hampered by the debts accrued from last time , and the extreme reluctance to make an already poor situation much worse .
however , to get on well in life one must ' have a career ' and to get the career , the ' piece of paper ' .
so despite my reluctance , i feel obliged to complete my studies , fear of debt or not !
d jones , uk if students are in such dire financial trouble , why is it that all the bars and clubs are full every night with them drinking themselves into a stupor ?
in the real world cutting back on socialising would be the first thing that would happen if you had no money .
jen olsen , uk " the average student lives on £ 20 per week " jo , uk jen olsen , those students you see in the bar are probably on their monthly night out .
the ones you see out are not the same as all students .
you will probably also not have noticed that the average student lives on £ 20 per week .
those bars and clubs will be at their fullest when we get our student loans which is the only time we usually think we have some extra cash to support ourselves .
i would like to see you try to survive on £ 3,400 for a whole year , to cover your rent , bills , food , books and tuition fees -lrb- at £ 1,200 per year -rrb- .
jo , uk jen , on what planet do you live ?
young people need to have some fun in their lives !
students are going to spend the best days of their life working , so give them time to it now .
students do n't think about the debt they will have in 10 years time ; they spend the money as soon as it arrives on rent , books or food , and whatever is left on luxuries like beer .
they get shafted from every direction until they graduate ; then it hits them they have to pay over £ 100 a month for 10 years , which means at least a basic salary of £ 20,000 just to live and pay back debt !
what a great future to look forward to !
that 's why i spent most of university down the bar !
peter finch , england " i became immune to being way over my head in the red " matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i remember getting my loans at university .
i was nervous at the idea of owing people money .
i soon became completely immune to being way over my head , out of control , in the red .
all students end up doing this and it 's hard to lose that attitude .
you spend the rest of your life able to ignore heavy debts until it all comes crashing down .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- we know from the a-level discussion that young people now work harder than ever before , so presumably they will be able , like i did , to work over 20 hours per week to fund themselves without debt .
there should be no shortage of low paid service sector jobs for them to fill .
stella , uk to say that it is not discouraging people from studying is ridiculous - neither of my younger brothers went to university because they did n't want the kind of debts i accrued .
toby , uk these days it 's not about trying not to get into debt , it 's about trying to cope with debt .
debt is a massive burden on most students trying to keep studying , which will affect university results .
maz , uk " f i knew swedish or dutch i would go there " james o ' hara , wales i just graduated , and managed to get through uni with only 5 grand of debt .
the people i know who are in the worst debt are those who blew all their money going out twice a week , and then not bothering to get summer jobs .
daniel kirwilliam , uk it is a major headache .
i finished university 5 years ago and still have one year to run to pay back the £ 500 loan for 4 years of study .
this is bad enough but now you can expect twice that as a minimum .
i doubt i would go knowing that i would be paying £ 250 a month for 5 years afterwards .
mark , uk i think its disgusting that the uk is the only country in the western world that does nothing to help students .
if i knew swedish or dutch i would go there for definite because academics are awarded for their achievements and persuaded and funded to go to university .
i have worked out that i will get £ 65 a week from my maximum loan .
so if my rent will be 64.50 how am i -lrb- or anyone -rrb- supposed to survive on 50p a week with no debt .
most of these moaning adults who say we shouldn ¿ t get any debt have either never been to university ... or went when it was funded with grants .
james o ' hara , cardiff , wales " stop moaning and get on with it " olivia macauslan , uk i am so bored with moaning students - i have a fulltime job and study at birkbeck coll .
i am financed by my work .
get a job in the area you wish to study in , in a large company or a government department and then apply for funding .
no debts and just as much fun .
for goodness sake stop moaning and get on with it .
olivia macauslan , uk my son is taking a tent to uni .
eileen , uk to all you would be students who are worried about debt , my advice would be learn a trade !
become a plumber or a builder or whatever - presumably you will be fairly smart -lrb- or you would n't be going to uni now would you ... -rrb- so it should be a simple process to become proficient in a useful trade , set up your own business and earn some respectable money whilst adding to your local economy which in turn boosts national gdp .
now that 's got to be better than working in a call centre for £ 4.50 per hr whilst struggling to pay back £ 15,000 surely ?
rob , uk its only worth taking a degree in subjects that lead to a professional career like law , medicine , engineering accountancy , dentistry and scientific research .
if those careers do n't interest you then take a short practical course or learn a trade rather than waste 3 years and vast sums of money on an arts or humanities degree in the attempt to make yourself more employable .
r sobrany , uk how short-sighted to you have to be to avoid university because of the fear of getting into debt ?
i have undergrad and post-grad degrees , and left university in 1994 with a £ 10,000 debt .
however , i got a job that i would never have been offered without my degrees , and paid off my debts in 2 years .
after 8 years of working in the city as a result of going to university , £ 10k no longer seems a lot of money .
it pays off when you take a longer term view .
matt , uk if i had known how much it would cost in advance , i would have put off studying and worked for a few years first .
terry johnson , oxford , uk if giving up luxuries is too difficult then getting a part-time job is the answer , find the balance between extra money and not damaging your potential grades .
students - it 's time to grow up and not expect hand outs , make the best of a given situation .
this is the only way to learn the harsh truth , look at your own lifestyle and make changes to it .
dan chang , uk " i think this is truly cruel " laura , uk tuition fees are partly responsible for the problems : £ 1,075 paid to the government is £ 1,075 less financial support the parents can give their child .
good education will bolster the economy , bringing benefits for all - it is only fair that the government pay for it .
andrew , uk i think it is disgusting that we should suffer so much debt for trying to better yourself .
my sister has recently finished her degree -lrb- 2:1 -rrb- in geography and wanted to be a teacher .
no one will take her on .
she can not get a good job as she is ' over qualified ' .
should being able and intelligent mean you have to go without , be in debt and depressed .
i think this is truly cruel .
i have therefore decided not to go to university as i believe it to be a waste of time and most of all money !
laura , uk i have a summer job and am one of those fortunate to be eligible for a grant under our means tested system here in ireland -lrb- which is bad for low-income self-employed and farmers - they 're expected to sell off their assets ! -rrb-
i pay no course fees , and even my administration fees -lrb- raised 70 % this year -rrb- are paid under the grants scheme .
yet i will only be able to cover half the coming year 's expenses .
the mind boggles as to the debt mounted up by those in britain and the north with no grants and course fees to pay !
conal , ireland there are other ways of earning an education : night school , the ou and technical courses / qualifications .
many employers are eager to pay for their employee 's education .
mathew , uk mp 's who criticise students for being lazy and wasting their money on alcohol should remember they are from a generation of students who received grants from the government .
helen carroll , england the nhs is crying out for doctors and a great majority of the people in my position are being put off by the enormous debts that we will have to accrue to finish the course .
i do n't mind doing it , as its my ambition , but where is the incentive - 28 years old and the equivalent of a mortgage before i have ever started ?
it seems the government wants it both ways , the want doctors and skilled people to graduate from university , but are unwilling to financially help to train them .
kind of unfair do n't you think ?
john-joe , england i knew that debt was inevitable by going to university .
but i 'm there because i know that when i finish i will be able to get a career which will enable me to pay off my debt without too much hassle .
simon , west sussex , uk i graduated a year ago , without debt after working 16 hours a week during term time .
it is possible to graduate without debt , there is more to life than drinking .
and it is n't true that students only went out when they 'd received their loans .
i knew a lot of people who went out all the time spending money , and moaning as their debt increased !
do n't drink too much and learn to cook is my advice !
i had a wonderful time at university , without getting drunk once !
rebecca , uk i think the government should drop the university charges .
if people want to better themselves , they should have that opportunity and not be charged for it .
it seems that , in this country , the only way to get a free education is to serve a prison sentence , which i do n't think is the correct message that we should be sending out .
andy , uk not going to uni did n't do me any harm .
ok , so it took me a while to get where i am now , but i 'm still only 25 have a tiny mortgage , own my own car outright and have no other debt bar my mortgage to worry about .
in my eyes , uni would n't have helped !
sandra , uk i 'm a student going into my third year , and am already over £ 4000 in debt , because of loans , overdrafts and credit cards .
there is very little help for students .
to have a reasonable standard of living you have to work which in turn affects your studies .
we 're not all out drinking and partying all the time - most of us ca n't afford it that often !
sarra lumsden , scotland i was going to study through a correspondence university in the uk .
if i had a uk address as opposed to a belgian one , it would have been a third of the price !
i did not take the course and will not source a course through that university ever again .
for half the price of one subject 's tuition fees , i would get a years full tuition in belgium .
sean hammon , belgium ex south africa when i went in the early eighties the grant system was still intact .
this meant that anybody from any social background could go as far as they were able to .
this is not the case today .
we are faced with a severe shortage of teachers and people like nhs scientific staff ; these are people who wo n't earn the big figures quoted elsewhere on this forum , will be saddled with crippling debt and are without doubt critical to the running of our society .
the return to a free and inclusive education system is imperative if we are to keep our essential services intact .
only problem is , most of us are too greedy to want to pay the tax to finance it .
andy , scotland " the only degrees that will pay off are the unstimulating business-applicable ones " james desborough , uk students are encouraged to believe their degree will be a passport to a fat paycheque , they are bombarded with figures and stats claiming " average graduate earnings " of about £ 18k and the like .
when i graduated last year i honestly believed i would walk into a £ 20k job with my 2.1 from nottingham - and look at me now , doing admin for £ 12k .
the two biggest misconceptions are that " a degree " is the same as a job focussed degree with relevant work experience ; and that a greater number of educated people will bolster our economy .
all it does is devalues the qualification , resulting in a lot of well educated people getting hacked off at having to work for peanuts in menial jobs -lrb- like me -rrb- !
james sykes , england i 'd love to apply again and go through uni as a mature student but it 's simply not worth it .
i 'll get further and faster getting work experience than i will with a degree and many grand worth of debt .
the only degrees that will pay off are the unstimulating business-applicable ones .
we 'll see a death of learning for the sake of learning this way .
that 's a shame .
james desborough , uk i have just completed my undergraduate degree at cambridge , and the university really helped me out .
there are lots of funds available -lrb- book grants , hardship loans , even money for extracurricular activities and travelling -rrb- for poorer students , which is a big advantage of going to a rich place !
lindsay hufton , uk without fees paid and a proper grant i could not have had a third level education .
if i were a school leaver now i would not consider it .
phil , uk personally i think that the people dictating that students should study a trade or a professional degree like medicine have no conception of the individual 's needs of wants .
i am completing a double major in chemistry and anthropology .
though the chemistry degree will probably pay for my endeavours my anthropology degree was not a waste to time or money as it has taught me where i fit into the world and has been kind of a wake-up call .
there are a lot of scientists out there who have no conception of other people and ways of life .
we could have cured diseases like malaria long ago , but because it rarely affects those of us in the west no-one seems to care so we continue to make chemicals that can kill thousands with a few milligrams !
yes i will be in debt for a long time , but i would n't trade that , the knowledge i have gained is priceless !
student , canada i feel that the comment i read on your site , that the high student drop out rate was in relation to a level grades ridiculous .
i achieved aab grades and i did not drop out due to being unacademic it was purely a financial decision .
jessica shackleton , england it seems to me that loans should not be based on parental income .
a friend of mine has parents on a far higher wage than my parents earn , so her loan will be significantly smaller than mine .
why is this , when the loan will have to be fully paid back anyway ?
she is disadvantaged simply because her parents have sought out well paid jobs .
this is just one a number of issues which surely need to be addressed with regard to university funding .
alison jane , uk i have just finished a 3 year law degree , and must admit there is a strong pressure to get involved in the ' drinking culture ' at uni .
the debts i have -lrb- £ 9,500- kept down with jobs every summer -rrb- was expected , and seems menial in comparison to the £ 7300 fees , and £ 4000 maintenance i will have to pay at law school .
i am lucky enough to have savings , but many friends are taking out further bank loans , around £ 12000 ! ! !
this is where i start to panic ! ! !
anna , uk i do n't really have a problem with the student loan - even though i currently owe about £ 12,000 .
i intend to pay it back as slowly as possible , because if i do have any spare money i can put it in a high interest account and make a profit .
many of my friends who do n't need the loan -lrb- rich parents -rrb- are still taking out the money because they can make a profit on it .
jo , uk i am starting university in september and it will be a part time course for three years .
i am a mother and live with my partner in rented accommodation .
we get no help from the government whatsoever and i do not expect it either but i have had to save up to get a qualification so that i do not get a student loan and land myself in loads of debt .
but i just wish the course was free and the government , which is supposed to back young people up , would do so .
today 's youth are tomorrow ¿ s adults : why do n't they invest more in young people then they would n't have to spend millions later ?
jolene beevers , england the sole advantage of paying tuition fees is that you have consumer 's rights .
if , as is the case at my daughter 's university , staff do n't turn up for lectures ; there are not enough technicians ; there are eighty students in your year when you were told at the interview there would be half that amount ; there is insufficient equipment , and some of that is broken ; and the department has run out of essential chemicals and wo n't be replacing them as they 've overspent the budget - then sue them !
the precedent has been set .
my daughter works hard at university and has two jobs , but she is constantly anxious and has no joy in her eyes .
i feel so sorry for her and all students - university should be about hard work , but it should also be a time you look back on with fond memories .
fm , uk means testing parents of young adults is unfair and a dubious practice at best .
we will be legally disowning our children before their 18th birthdays and assigning guardianship to a retired relative .
i believe this is the appropriate response .
andrew , british ex-pat would i have gone to university to study engineering if a full grant had n't been available ?
almost certainly not : engineering is notoriously poorly paid , and my family had old-fashioned values : work hard and do n't live on credit .
the current system encourages a habit of debt which is profitable for the banks , but not necessarily desirable .
perhaps its time for degrees to return to their academic roots , and for courses like media studies to be made level 4 gnvqs or nvqs , which would be far more appropriate .
guy chapman , uk i had no debt and received a sizeable allowance from my parents .
unlike some of my similarly fortunate contemporaries , i did n't spend it on drugs and a third class degree .
i worked hard and got a first .

students who gained record a-level grades this week can expect to face up to £ 15,000 of debt when they finish university .
by 2010 the government wants half of all under-30s to take a degree - seven times the proportion in the 1960s .
not many school leavers have a realistic concept of the expense of going to university : a survey by goldfish says nearly 20 % had no clue how much food costs .
a degree improves career and financial prospects in the long-term and graduates are twice as likely to be promoted at work and go on holiday abroad , says the government .
but some now believe that high levels of debt is making access to higher education " exclusive " - and putting many people off .
is debt discouraging you from studying ?
what can students do to help themselves ?
how should the government help ?
how easy have you found it to pay off your debts after graduating ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
we viewed it as much better to save up for something john , england when i went to university in 1990 , i came from a family that did not live on debt .
we viewed it as much better to save up for something , and wait until we could afford it .
if it had n't been for the grant available , i simply could n't have afforded university , and would n't have gone .
without the degree , i 'd have been much less useful to our country in my working life .
john , england after the age of 18 , you are supposed to be an adult , free to choose your own path and take full responsibility .
what on earth has it got to do with your parents whether you get support or not with further education ?
grow up , get on with your lives , make hard choices about investing in education or not , learn to cope with financial pressures and get on with it .
welcome to the real world !
stephen , uk i would like to train as a nurse , but the £ 5,000 will not be enough to support my family .
if the government needed nurses that much they would do all they could to help those of us get into the training without worrying about debt .
i am in two minds at the moment .
rachel , uk if any foreign company offers me money , i 'm off vish , uk i graduated with £ 30k worth of debt , which will take until i am 35 to clear .
do n't expect me to be grateful to this country / government for my education .
if any foreign company offers me money , i 'm off .
vish , uk i do n't understand the government 's obsession with getting 50 % of people to study for a degree .
the degree is now devalued and commonplace - many graduates will still end up with lowly paid admin jobs that 20 years ago you could 've done with a couple of o-levels .
they will be in debt until middle age .
i would strongly advise young people today to get into a trade or job early .
that way you have 3-5 years more work experience and if you 're careful no crippling debt when you compare yourself to your peers who carried on to university and got worthless degrees in art history or sociology .
carol child , uk i say bring back the grants and give those poor students a chance to enjoy life - i 'd happily pay an extra penny in the pound tax to support them .
better spent on students than on stupid domes or fountains for diana .
anon , uk remember - it 's not your money alex banks , uk i graduated with £ 4,220 debt - i was the last of the grant students and had no tuition fees , but i had a part time bar job and did n't go clubbing three times a week nor did i buy m & s instant meals .
i paid my debt in just over 18 months .
a word of warning to any students about to go to university - take out whatever overdraft or loan you want , but remember - it 's not your money .
the bank is throwing that money at you now , but you will have to pay that back .
alex banks , uk the people most at risk from debt are those whose degrees were undertaken simply for the university experience chris , uk a university education should place you in a position to effectively deal with the debts which result from it .
like anything else , it is an investment , and if made wisely it will pay off - the people most at risk from debt are those whose degrees were undertaken simply for the university experience or with no real direction .
-lrb- incidentally , my university education was wholly funded by loans ! -rrb- .
chris , uk many people are quite prepared to get tens of thousands in debt to buy a car or even hundreds of thousands in debt to buy a house but not a few thousand to get an education which vastly improves the quality of life !
why is this ?
tom , uk what i object to is having a loan in my name but based on my parent 's income .
nowhere else do such crazy rules apply .
parental income often bears little resemblance to parental contribution .
let students stand on their own two feet , give all students access to bigger loans and finally there will be equality of opportunity .
grants based on parental income are not the answer .
jonathan rose , england in less than a month , i 'll start my uni life in portsmouth .
the first thing that 'll greet me there is a cheque for over £ 1,000 .
i intend to keep hold of that money for as long as i can which is why i have already arranged a job in the local bowling alley .
i will still end up in debt , but hopefully not as much as some as i 've seen many friends fritter away their loans on cds and clothes .
simon grey , southampton , uk i went to university several years ago and within a year was in debt to a level sufficient enough for me to drop out and start work .
i want to go back to university but the financial implications make it nearly impossible .
grants should be returned so that students can go without having to worry about living in debt for 10 years after they graduate .
kobe , wales i was forced out of university after year two due to imminent financial disaster john , england i am in a similar situation to kobe from wales .
i was forced out of university after year two due to imminent financial disaster .
i am still paying off the student loans .
i am completing the degree , however , with the open university , which allows me to work full time .
i could have been helped if the employers of this country were to become more flexible about working hours .
if they did , not only would more people be able to go back to studying , buy the rush hour congestion may be relieved as well !
john , england like kobe , i too dropped out of university to get a job .
unfortunately it was in the third year , so i have to work as a temp on abysmal wages , and am still saddled with these debts .
i 'd like to go back and pick up where i left off , but i find that i 'm hampered by the debts accrued from last time , and the extreme reluctance to make an already poor situation much worse .
however , to get on well in life one must ' have a career ' and to get the career , the ' piece of paper ' .
so despite my reluctance , i feel obliged to complete my studies , fear of debt or not !
d jones , uk if students are in such dire financial trouble , why is it that all the bars and clubs are full every night with them drinking themselves into a stupor ?
in the real world cutting back on socialising would be the first thing that would happen if you had no money .
jen olsen , uk the average student lives on £ 20 per week jo , uk jen olsen , those students you see in the bar are probably on their monthly night out .
the ones you see out are not the same as all students .
you will probably also not have noticed that the average student lives on £ 20 per week .
those bars and clubs will be at their fullest when we get our student loans which is the only time we usually think we have some extra cash to support ourselves .
i would like to see you try to survive on £ 3,400 for a whole year , to cover your rent , bills , food , books and tuition fees -lrb- at £ 1,200 per year -rrb- .
jo , uk jen , on what planet do you live ?
young people need to have some fun in their lives !
students are going to spend the best days of their life working , so give them time to it now .
students do n't think about the debt they will have in 10 years time ; they spend the money as soon as it arrives on rent , books or food , and whatever is left on luxuries like beer .
they get shafted from every direction until they graduate ; then it hits them they have to pay over £ 100 a month for 10 years , which means at least a basic salary of £ 20,000 just to live and pay back debt !
what a great future to look forward to !
that 's why i spent most of university down the bar !
peter finch , england i became immune to being way over my head in the red matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i remember getting my loans at university .
i was nervous at the idea of owing people money .
i soon became completely immune to being way over my head , out of control , in the red .
all students end up doing this and it 's hard to lose that attitude .
you spend the rest of your life able to ignore heavy debts until it all comes crashing down .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- we know from the a-level discussion that young people now work harder than ever before , so presumably they will be able , like i did , to work over 20 hours per week to fund themselves without debt .
there should be no shortage of low paid service sector jobs for them to fill .
stella , uk to say that it is not discouraging people from studying is ridiculous - neither of my younger brothers went to university because they did n't want the kind of debts i accrued .
toby , uk these days it 's not about trying not to get into debt , it 's about trying to cope with debt .
debt is a massive burden on most students trying to keep studying , which will affect university results .
maz , uk f i knew swedish or dutch i would go there james o ' hara , wales i just graduated , and managed to get through uni with only 5 grand of debt .
the people i know who are in the worst debt are those who blew all their money going out twice a week , and then not bothering to get summer jobs .
daniel kirwilliam , uk it is a major headache .
i finished university 5 years ago and still have one year to run to pay back the £ 500 loan for 4 years of study .
this is bad enough but now you can expect twice that as a minimum .
i doubt i would go knowing that i would be paying £ 250 a month for 5 years afterwards .
mark , uk i think its disgusting that the uk is the only country in the western world that does nothing to help students .
if i knew swedish or dutch i would go there for definite because academics are awarded for their achievements and persuaded and funded to go to university .
i have worked out that i will get £ 65 a week from my maximum loan .
so if my rent will be 64.50 how am i -lrb- or anyone -rrb- supposed to survive on 50p a week with no debt .
most of these moaning adults who say we shouldn ¿ t get any debt have either never been to university ... or went when it was funded with grants .
james o ' hara , cardiff , wales stop moaning and get on with it olivia macauslan , uk i am so bored with moaning students - i have a fulltime job and study at birkbeck coll .
i am financed by my work .
get a job in the area you wish to study in , in a large company or a government department and then apply for funding .
no debts and just as much fun .
for goodness sake stop moaning and get on with it .
olivia macauslan , uk my son is taking a tent to uni .
eileen , uk to all you would be students who are worried about debt , my advice would be learn a trade !
become a plumber or a builder or whatever - presumably you will be fairly smart -lrb- or you would n't be going to uni now would you ... -rrb- so it should be a simple process to become proficient in a useful trade , set up your own business and earn some respectable money whilst adding to your local economy which in turn boosts national gdp .
now that 's got to be better than working in a call centre for £ 4.50 per hr whilst struggling to pay back £ 15,000 surely ?
rob , uk its only worth taking a degree in subjects that lead to a professional career like law , medicine , engineering accountancy , dentistry and scientific research .
if those careers do n't interest you then take a short practical course or learn a trade rather than waste 3 years and vast sums of money on an arts or humanities degree in the attempt to make yourself more employable .
r sobrany , uk how short-sighted to you have to be to avoid university because of the fear of getting into debt ?
i have undergrad and post-grad degrees , and left university in 1994 with a £ 10,000 debt .
however , i got a job that i would never have been offered without my degrees , and paid off my debts in 2 years .
after 8 years of working in the city as a result of going to university , £ 10k no longer seems a lot of money .
it pays off when you take a longer term view .
matt , uk if i had known how much it would cost in advance , i would have put off studying and worked for a few years first .
terry johnson , oxford , uk if giving up luxuries is too difficult then getting a part-time job is the answer , find the balance between extra money and not damaging your potential grades .
students - it 's time to grow up and not expect hand outs , make the best of a given situation .
this is the only way to learn the harsh truth , look at your own lifestyle and make changes to it .
dan chang , uk i think this is truly cruel laura , uk tuition fees are partly responsible for the problems : £ 1,075 paid to the government is £ 1,075 less financial support the parents can give their child .
good education will bolster the economy , bringing benefits for all - it is only fair that the government pay for it .
andrew , uk i think it is disgusting that we should suffer so much debt for trying to better yourself .
my sister has recently finished her degree -lrb- 2:1 -rrb- in geography and wanted to be a teacher .
no one will take her on .
she can not get a good job as she is ' over qualified ' .
should being able and intelligent mean you have to go without , be in debt and depressed .
i think this is truly cruel .
i have therefore decided not to go to university as i believe it to be a waste of time and most of all money !
laura , uk i have a summer job and am one of those fortunate to be eligible for a grant under our means tested system here in ireland -lrb- which is bad for low-income self-employed and farmers - they 're expected to sell off their assets ! -rrb-
i pay no course fees , and even my administration fees -lrb- raised 70 % this year -rrb- are paid under the grants scheme .
yet i will only be able to cover half the coming year 's expenses .
the mind boggles as to the debt mounted up by those in britain and the north with no grants and course fees to pay !
conal , ireland there are other ways of earning an education : night school , the ou and technical courses / qualifications .
many employers are eager to pay for their employee 's education .
mathew , uk mp 's who criticise students for being lazy and wasting their money on alcohol should remember they are from a generation of students who received grants from the government .
helen carroll , england the nhs is crying out for doctors and a great majority of the people in my position are being put off by the enormous debts that we will have to accrue to finish the course .
i do n't mind doing it , as its my ambition , but where is the incentive - 28 years old and the equivalent of a mortgage before i have ever started ?
it seems the government wants it both ways , the want doctors and skilled people to graduate from university , but are unwilling to financially help to train them .
kind of unfair do n't you think ?
john-joe , england i knew that debt was inevitable by going to university .
but i 'm there because i know that when i finish i will be able to get a career which will enable me to pay off my debt without too much hassle .
simon , west sussex , uk i graduated a year ago , without debt after working 16 hours a week during term time .
it is possible to graduate without debt , there is more to life than drinking .
and it is n't true that students only went out when they 'd received their loans .
i knew a lot of people who went out all the time spending money , and moaning as their debt increased !
do n't drink too much and learn to cook is my advice !
i had a wonderful time at university , without getting drunk once !
rebecca , uk i think the government should drop the university charges .
if people want to better themselves , they should have that opportunity and not be charged for it .
it seems that , in this country , the only way to get a free education is to serve a prison sentence , which i do n't think is the correct message that we should be sending out .
andy , uk not going to uni did n't do me any harm .
ok , so it took me a while to get where i am now , but i 'm still only 25 have a tiny mortgage , own my own car outright and have no other debt bar my mortgage to worry about .
in my eyes , uni would n't have helped !
sandra , uk i 'm a student going into my third year , and am already over £ 4000 in debt , because of loans , overdrafts and credit cards .
there is very little help for students .
to have a reasonable standard of living you have to work which in turn affects your studies .
we 're not all out drinking and partying all the time - most of us ca n't afford it that often !
sarra lumsden , scotland i was going to study through a correspondence university in the uk .
if i had a uk address as opposed to a belgian one , it would have been a third of the price !
i did not take the course and will not source a course through that university ever again .
for half the price of one subject 's tuition fees , i would get a years full tuition in belgium .
sean hammon , belgium ex south africa when i went in the early eighties the grant system was still intact .
this meant that anybody from any social background could go as far as they were able to .
this is not the case today .
we are faced with a severe shortage of teachers and people like nhs scientific staff ; these are people who wo n't earn the big figures quoted elsewhere on this forum , will be saddled with crippling debt and are without doubt critical to the running of our society .
the return to a free and inclusive education system is imperative if we are to keep our essential services intact .
only problem is , most of us are too greedy to want to pay the tax to finance it .
andy , scotland the only degrees that will pay off are the unstimulating business-applicable ones james desborough , uk students are encouraged to believe their degree will be a passport to a fat paycheque , they are bombarded with figures and stats claiming " average graduate earnings " of about £ 18k and the like .
when i graduated last year i honestly believed i would walk into a £ 20k job with my 2.1 from nottingham - and look at me now , doing admin for £ 12k .
the two biggest misconceptions are that " a degree " is the same as a job focussed degree with relevant work experience ; and that a greater number of educated people will bolster our economy .
all it does is devalues the qualification , resulting in a lot of well educated people getting hacked off at having to work for peanuts in menial jobs -lrb- like me -rrb- !
james sykes , england i 'd love to apply again and go through uni as a mature student but it 's simply not worth it .
i 'll get further and faster getting work experience than i will with a degree and many grand worth of debt .
the only degrees that will pay off are the unstimulating business-applicable ones .
we 'll see a death of learning for the sake of learning this way .
that 's a shame .
james desborough , uk i have just completed my undergraduate degree at cambridge , and the university really helped me out .
there are lots of funds available -lrb- book grants , hardship loans , even money for extracurricular activities and travelling -rrb- for poorer students , which is a big advantage of going to a rich place !
lindsay hufton , uk without fees paid and a proper grant i could not have had a third level education .

students who gained record a-level grades this week can expect to face up to £ 15,000 of debt when they finish university .
by 2010 the government wants half of all under-30s to take a degree - seven times the proportion in the 1960s .
not many school leavers have a realistic concept of the expense of going to university : a survey by goldfish says nearly 20 % had no clue how much food costs .
a degree improves career and financial prospects in the long-term and graduates are twice as likely to be promoted at work and go on holiday abroad , says the government .
but some now believe that high levels of debt is making access to higher education " exclusive " - and putting many people off .
is debt discouraging you from studying ?
what can students do to help themselves ?
how should the government help ?
how easy have you found it to pay off your debts after graduating ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
we viewed it as much better to save up for something john , england when i went to university in 1990 , i came from a family that did not live on debt .
we viewed it as much better to save up for something , and wait until we could afford it .
if it had n't been for the grant available , i simply could n't have afforded university , and would n't have gone .
without the degree , i 'd have been much less useful to our country in my working life .
john , england after the age of 18 , you are supposed to be an adult , free to choose your own path and take full responsibility .
what on earth has it got to do with your parents whether you get support or not with further education ?
grow up , get on with your lives , make hard choices about investing in education or not , learn to cope with financial pressures and get on with it .
welcome to the real world !
stephen , uk i would like to train as a nurse , but the £ 5,000 will not be enough to support my family .
if the government needed nurses that much they would do all they could to help those of us get into the training without worrying about debt .
i am in two minds at the moment .
rachel , uk if any foreign company offers me money , i 'm off vish , uk i graduated with £ 30k worth of debt , which will take until i am 35 to clear .
do n't expect me to be grateful to this country / government for my education .
if any foreign company offers me money , i 'm off .
vish , uk i do n't understand the government 's obsession with getting 50 % of people to study for a degree .
the degree is now devalued and commonplace - many graduates will still end up with lowly paid admin jobs that 20 years ago you could 've done with a couple of o-levels .
they will be in debt until middle age .
i would strongly advise young people today to get into a trade or job early .
that way you have 3-5 years more work experience and if you 're careful no crippling debt when you compare yourself to your peers who carried on to university and got worthless degrees in art history or sociology .
carol child , uk i say bring back the grants and give those poor students a chance to enjoy life - i 'd happily pay an extra penny in the pound tax to support them .
better spent on students than on stupid domes or fountains for diana .
anon , uk remember - it 's not your money alex banks , uk i graduated with £ 4,220 debt - i was the last of the grant students and had no tuition fees , but i had a part time bar job and did n't go clubbing three times a week nor did i buy m & s instant meals .
i paid my debt in just over 18 months .
a word of warning to any students about to go to university - take out whatever overdraft or loan you want , but remember - it 's not your money .
the bank is throwing that money at you now , but you will have to pay that back .
alex banks , uk the people most at risk from debt are those whose degrees were undertaken simply for the university experience chris , uk a university education should place you in a position to effectively deal with the debts which result from it .
like anything else , it is an investment , and if made wisely it will pay off - the people most at risk from debt are those whose degrees were undertaken simply for the university experience or with no real direction .
-lrb- incidentally , my university education was wholly funded by loans ! -rrb- .
chris , uk many people are quite prepared to get tens of thousands in debt to buy a car or even hundreds of thousands in debt to buy a house but not a few thousand to get an education which vastly improves the quality of life !
why is this ?
tom , uk what i object to is having a loan in my name but based on my parent 's income .
nowhere else do such crazy rules apply .
parental income often bears little resemblance to parental contribution .
let students stand on their own two feet , give all students access to bigger loans and finally there will be equality of opportunity .
grants based on parental income are not the answer .
jonathan rose , england in less than a month , i 'll start my uni life in portsmouth .
the first thing that 'll greet me there is a cheque for over £ 1,000 .
i intend to keep hold of that money for as long as i can which is why i have already arranged a job in the local bowling alley .
i will still end up in debt , but hopefully not as much as some as i 've seen many friends fritter away their loans on cds and clothes .
simon grey , southampton , uk i went to university several years ago and within a year was in debt to a level sufficient enough for me to drop out and start work .
i want to go back to university but the financial implications make it nearly impossible .
grants should be returned so that students can go without having to worry about living in debt for 10 years after they graduate .
kobe , wales i was forced out of university after year two due to imminent financial disaster john , england i am in a similar situation to kobe from wales .
i was forced out of university after year two due to imminent financial disaster .
i am still paying off the student loans .
i am completing the degree , however , with the open university , which allows me to work full time .
i could have been helped if the employers of this country were to become more flexible about working hours .
if they did , not only would more people be able to go back to studying , buy the rush hour congestion may be relieved as well !
john , england like kobe , i too dropped out of university to get a job .
unfortunately it was in the third year , so i have to work as a temp on abysmal wages , and am still saddled with these debts .
i 'd like to go back and pick up where i left off , but i find that i 'm hampered by the debts accrued from last time , and the extreme reluctance to make an already poor situation much worse .
however , to get on well in life one must ' have a career ' and to get the career , the ' piece of paper ' .
so despite my reluctance , i feel obliged to complete my studies , fear of debt or not !
d jones , uk if students are in such dire financial trouble , why is it that all the bars and clubs are full every night with them drinking themselves into a stupor ?
in the real world cutting back on socialising would be the first thing that would happen if you had no money .
jen olsen , uk the average student lives on £ 20 per week jo , uk jen olsen , those students you see in the bar are probably on their monthly night out .
the ones you see out are not the same as all students .
you will probably also not have noticed that the average student lives on £ 20 per week .
those bars and clubs will be at their fullest when we get our student loans which is the only time we usually think we have some extra cash to support ourselves .
i would like to see you try to survive on £ 3,400 for a whole year , to cover your rent , bills , food , books and tuition fees -lrb- at £ 1,200 per year -rrb- .
jo , uk jen , on what planet do you live ?
young people need to have some fun in their lives !
students are going to spend the best days of their life working , so give them time to it now .
students do n't think about the debt they will have in 10 years time ; they spend the money as soon as it arrives on rent , books or food , and whatever is left on luxuries like beer .
they get shafted from every direction until they graduate ; then it hits them they have to pay over £ 100 a month for 10 years , which means at least a basic salary of £ 20,000 just to live and pay back debt !
what a great future to look forward to !
that 's why i spent most of university down the bar !
peter finch , england i became immune to being way over my head in the red matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i remember getting my loans at university .
i was nervous at the idea of owing people money .
i soon became completely immune to being way over my head , out of control , in the red .
all students end up doing this and it 's hard to lose that attitude .
you spend the rest of your life able to ignore heavy debts until it all comes crashing down .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- we know from the a-level discussion that young people now work harder than ever before , so presumably they will be able , like i did , to work over 20 hours per week to fund themselves without debt .
there should be no shortage of low paid service sector jobs for them to fill .
stella , uk to say that it is not discouraging people from studying is ridiculous - neither of my younger brothers went to university because they did n't want the kind of debts i accrued .
toby , uk these days it 's not about trying not to get into debt , it 's about trying to cope with debt .
debt is a massive burden on most students trying to keep studying , which will affect university results .
maz , uk f i knew swedish or dutch i would go there james o ' hara , wales i just graduated , and managed to get through uni with only 5 grand of debt .
the people i know who are in the worst debt are those who blew all their money going out twice a week , and then not bothering to get summer jobs .
daniel kirwilliam , uk it is a major headache .
i finished university 5 years ago and still have one year to run to pay back the £ 500 loan for 4 years of study .
this is bad enough but now you can expect twice that as a minimum .
i doubt i would go knowing that i would be paying £ 250 a month for 5 years afterwards .
mark , uk i think its disgusting that the uk is the only country in the western world that does nothing to help students .
if i knew swedish or dutch i would go there for definite because academics are awarded for their achievements and persuaded and funded to go to university .
i have worked out that i will get £ 65 a week from my maximum loan .
so if my rent will be 64.50 how am i -lrb- or anyone -rrb- supposed to survive on 50p a week with no debt .
most of these moaning adults who say we shouldn ¿ t get any debt have either never been to university ... or went when it was funded with grants .
james o ' hara , cardiff , wales stop moaning and get on with it olivia macauslan , uk i am so bored with moaning students - i have a fulltime job and study at birkbeck coll .
i am financed by my work .
get a job in the area you wish to study in , in a large company or a government department and then apply for funding .
no debts and just as much fun .
for goodness sake stop moaning and get on with it .
olivia macauslan , uk my son is taking a tent to uni .
eileen , uk to all you would be students who are worried about debt , my advice would be learn a trade !
become a plumber or a builder or whatever - presumably you will be fairly smart -lrb- or you would n't be going to uni now would you ... -rrb- so it should be a simple process to become proficient in a useful trade , set up your own business and earn some respectable money whilst adding to your local economy which in turn boosts national gdp .
now that 's got to be better than working in a call centre for £ 4.50 per hr whilst struggling to pay back £ 15,000 surely ?
rob , uk its only worth taking a degree in subjects that lead to a professional career like law , medicine , engineering accountancy , dentistry and scientific research .
if those careers do n't interest you then take a short practical course or learn a trade rather than waste 3 years and vast sums of money on an arts or humanities degree in the attempt to make yourself more employable .
r sobrany , uk how short-sighted to you have to be to avoid university because of the fear of getting into debt ?
i have undergrad and post-grad degrees , and left university in 1994 with a £ 10,000 debt .
however , i got a job that i would never have been offered without my degrees , and paid off my debts in 2 years .
after 8 years of working in the city as a result of going to university , £ 10k no longer seems a lot of money .
it pays off when you take a longer term view .
matt , uk if i had known how much it would cost in advance , i would have put off studying and worked for a few years first .
terry johnson , oxford , uk if giving up luxuries is too difficult then getting a part-time job is the answer , find the balance between extra money and not damaging your potential grades .
students - it 's time to grow up and not expect hand outs , make the best of a given situation .
this is the only way to learn the harsh truth , look at your own lifestyle and make changes to it .
dan chang , uk i think this is truly cruel laura , uk tuition fees are partly responsible for the problems : £ 1,075 paid to the government is £ 1,075 less financial support the parents can give their child .
good education will bolster the economy , bringing benefits for all - it is only fair that the government pay for it .
andrew , uk i think it is disgusting that we should suffer so much debt for trying to better yourself .
my sister has recently finished her degree -lrb- 2:1 -rrb- in geography and wanted to be a teacher .
no one will take her on .
she can not get a good job as she is ' over qualified ' .
should being able and intelligent mean you have to go without , be in debt and depressed .
i think this is truly cruel .
i have therefore decided not to go to university as i believe it to be a waste of time and most of all money !
laura , uk i have a summer job and am one of those fortunate to be eligible for a grant under our means tested system here in ireland -lrb- which is bad for low-income self-employed and farmers - they 're expected to sell off their assets ! -rrb-
i pay no course fees , and even my administration fees -lrb- raised 70 % this year -rrb- are paid under the grants scheme .
yet i will only be able to cover half the coming year 's expenses .
the mind boggles as to the debt mounted up by those in britain and the north with no grants and course fees to pay !
conal , ireland there are other ways of earning an education : night school , the ou and technical courses / qualifications .
many employers are eager to pay for their employee 's education .
mathew , uk mp 's who criticise students for being lazy and wasting their money on alcohol should remember they are from a generation of students who received grants from the government .
helen carroll , england the nhs is crying out for doctors and a great majority of the people in my position are being put off by the enormous debts that we will have to accrue to finish the course .
i do n't mind doing it , as its my ambition , but where is the incentive - 28 years old and the equivalent of a mortgage before i have ever started ?
it seems the government wants it both ways , the want doctors and skilled people to graduate from university , but are unwilling to financially help to train them .
kind of unfair do n't you think ?
john-joe , england i knew that debt was inevitable by going to university .
but i 'm there because i know that when i finish i will be able to get a career which will enable me to pay off my debt without too much hassle .
simon , west sussex , uk i graduated a year ago , without debt after working 16 hours a week during term time .
it is possible to graduate without debt , there is more to life than drinking .
and it is n't true that students only went out when they 'd received their loans .
i knew a lot of people who went out all the time spending money , and moaning as their debt increased !
do n't drink too much and learn to cook is my advice !
i had a wonderful time at university , without getting drunk once !
rebecca , uk i think the government should drop the university charges .
if people want to better themselves , they should have that opportunity and not be charged for it .
it seems that , in this country , the only way to get a free education is to serve a prison sentence , which i do n't think is the correct message that we should be sending out .
andy , uk not going to uni did n't do me any harm .
ok , so it took me a while to get where i am now , but i 'm still only 25 have a tiny mortgage , own my own car outright and have no other debt bar my mortgage to worry about .
in my eyes , uni would n't have helped !
sandra , uk i 'm a student going into my third year , and am already over £ 4000 in debt , because of loans , overdrafts and credit cards .
there is very little help for students .
to have a reasonable standard of living you have to work which in turn affects your studies .
we 're not all out drinking and partying all the time - most of us ca n't afford it that often !
sarra lumsden , scotland i was going to study through a correspondence university in the uk .
if i had a uk address as opposed to a belgian one , it would have been a third of the price !
i did not take the course and will not source a course through that university ever again .
for half the price of one subject 's tuition fees , i would get a years full tuition in belgium .
sean hammon , belgium ex south africa when i went in the early eighties the grant system was still intact .
this meant that anybody from any social background could go as far as they were able to .
this is not the case today .
we are faced with a severe shortage of teachers and people like nhs scientific staff ; these are people who wo n't earn the big figures quoted elsewhere on this forum , will be saddled with crippling debt and are without doubt critical to the running of our society .
the return to a free and inclusive education system is imperative if we are to keep our essential services intact .
only problem is , most of us are too greedy to want to pay the tax to finance it .
andy , scotland the only degrees that will pay off are the unstimulating business-applicable ones james desborough , uk students are encouraged to believe their degree will be a passport to a fat paycheque , they are bombarded with figures and stats claiming " average graduate earnings " of about £ 18k and the like .
when i graduated last year i honestly believed i would walk into a £ 20k job with my 2.1 from nottingham - and look at me now , doing admin for £ 12k .
the two biggest misconceptions are that " a degree " is the same as a job focussed degree with relevant work experience ; and that a greater number of educated people will bolster our economy .
all it does is devalues the qualification , resulting in a lot of well educated people getting hacked off at having to work for peanuts in menial jobs -lrb- like me -rrb- !
james sykes , england i 'd love to apply again and go through uni as a mature student but it 's simply not worth it .
i 'll get further and faster getting work experience than i will with a degree and many grand worth of debt .
the only degrees that will pay off are the unstimulating business-applicable ones .
we 'll see a death of learning for the sake of learning this way .
that 's a shame .
james desborough , uk i have just completed my undergraduate degree at cambridge , and the university really helped me out .
there are lots of funds available -lrb- book grants , hardship loans , even money for extracurricular activities and travelling -rrb- for poorer students , which is a big advantage of going to a rich place !
lindsay hufton , uk without fees paid and a proper grant i could not have had a third level education .
if i were a school leaver now i would not consider it .
phil , uk personally i think that the people dictating that students should study a trade or a professional degree like medicine have no conception of the individual 's needs of wants .
i am completing a double major in chemistry and anthropology .
though the chemistry degree will probably pay for my endeavours my anthropology degree was not a waste to time or money as it has taught me where i fit into the world and has been kind of a wake-up call .
there are a lot of scientists out there who have no conception of other people and ways of life .
we could have cured diseases like malaria long ago , but because it rarely affects those of us in the west no-one seems to care so we continue to make chemicals that can kill thousands with a few milligrams !
yes i will be in debt for a long time , but i would n't trade that , the knowledge i have gained is priceless !
student , canada i feel that the comment i read on your site , that the high student drop out rate was in relation to a level grades ridiculous .
i achieved aab grades and i did not drop out due to being unacademic it was purely a financial decision .
jessica shackleton , england it seems to me that loans should not be based on parental income .
a friend of mine has parents on a far higher wage than my parents earn , so her loan will be significantly smaller than mine .
why is this , when the loan will have to be fully paid back anyway ?
she is disadvantaged simply because her parents have sought out well paid jobs .
this is just one a number of issues which surely need to be addressed with regard to university funding .
alison jane , uk i have just finished a 3 year law degree , and must admit there is a strong pressure to get involved in the ' drinking culture ' at uni .
the debts i have -lrb- £ 9,500- kept down with jobs every summer -rrb- was expected , and seems menial in comparison to the £ 7300 fees , and £ 4000 maintenance i will have to pay at law school .
i am lucky enough to have savings , but many friends are taking out further bank loans , around £ 12000 ! ! !
this is where i start to panic ! ! !
anna , uk i do n't really have a problem with the student loan - even though i currently owe about £ 12,000 .
i intend to pay it back as slowly as possible , because if i do have any spare money i can put it in a high interest account and make a profit .
many of my friends who do n't need the loan -lrb- rich parents -rrb- are still taking out the money because they can make a profit on it .
jo , uk i am starting university in september and it will be a part time course for three years .
i am a mother and live with my partner in rented accommodation .
we get no help from the government whatsoever and i do not expect it either but i have had to save up to get a qualification so that i do not get a student loan and land myself in loads of debt .
but i just wish the course was free and the government , which is supposed to back young people up , would do so .
today 's youth are tomorrow ¿ s adults : why do n't they invest more in young people then they would n't have to spend millions later ?
jolene beevers , england the sole advantage of paying tuition fees is that you have consumer 's rights .
if , as is the case at my daughter 's university , staff do n't turn up for lectures ; there are not enough technicians ; there are eighty students in your year when you were told at the interview there would be half that amount ; there is insufficient equipment , and some of that is broken ; and the department has run out of essential chemicals and wo n't be replacing them as they 've overspent the budget - then sue them !
the precedent has been set .
my daughter works hard at university and has two jobs , but she is constantly anxious and has no joy in her eyes .
i feel so sorry for her and all students - university should be about hard work , but it should also be a time you look back on with fond memories .
fm , uk means testing parents of young adults is unfair and a dubious practice at best .
we will be legally disowning our children before their 18th birthdays and assigning guardianship to a retired relative .
i believe this is the appropriate response .
andrew , british ex-pat would i have gone to university to study engineering if a full grant had n't been available ?
almost certainly not : engineering is notoriously poorly paid , and my family had old-fashioned values : work hard and do n't live on credit .
the current system encourages a habit of debt which is profitable for the banks , but not necessarily desirable .
perhaps its time for degrees to return to their academic roots , and for courses like media studies to be made level 4 gnvqs or nvqs , which would be far more appropriate .
guy chapman , uk i had no debt and received a sizeable allowance from my parents .
unlike some of my similarly fortunate contemporaries , i did n't spend it on drugs and a third class degree .
i worked hard and got a first .
