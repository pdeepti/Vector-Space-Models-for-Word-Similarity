as oil continued to drift towards the coastline , angry locals braved driving rain to get the message out that the government had done too little , too late , in the wake of the tanker 's messy demise .
the people of the province have spent the past two weeks fighting against an initial 6,000-ton slick that came ashore after the prestige , an aging single-hulled tanker registered in liberia and flagged to the bahamas , was holed in storms .

a majority of the christian democratic union / christian social union parliamentary groups voted in favor of launching official proceedings although a number of parliamentarians voiced concern that the committee could be viewed merely as an electioneering instrument .
the committee 's main job will be to investigate what the conservatives are gleefully calling the government 's " broken promises " on tax and spending .

the european parliament voted to forbid tobacco advertisements in the media on wednesday .
with millions of euros in advertising at stake for an already struggling media , german parliamentarians are fighting back . in an overwhelming 311-202 vote , the european parliament approved draft legislation on wednesday that marks a first step toward a ban on tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines , radio and the internet . " it 's an important day for public health , " the european union 's health and consumer affairs commissioner , david byrne , told reporters .
" this will help reduce tobacco consumption by removing the image that tobacco is ' cool , " ' he said . the legislation , which still faces many hurdles , could hit the german media market particularly hard .
the cigarette industry spends 60 million euros -lrb- $ 60.1 million -rrb- per year on advertising in germany , the country with the eu 's highest concentration of young smokers . " it 's not necessarily about loosing income " , said thorsten münch , a spokesman for the health commissioner .
when the german publishing tycoon herbert burda met with byrne , he was mainly concerned that a ban on tobacco advertising could lead to further advertising bans , münch told dw-world . though billboard and movie theater ads will still be allowed , byrne 's draft will also stop tobacco companies sponsoring international eu events like concerts , soccer games and formula one car racing . german politicians fume over rules the move also marks byrne 's second attempt at anti-tobacco advertising legislation .
following considerable criticism from germany and other eu member states , the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- quashed a similar directive two years ago , ruling that it overstepped the eu 's jurisdiction .
once again , german members of the european parliament voted against the legislation . " europe ca n't declare a ban where there are n't any cross-border conflicts due to competition , " said kurt lechner , a member of the european parliament , explaining the position of many german politicians .
" in the german market , german newspapers compete with each other .
but there is n't any serious competition between italian newspapers and german newspapers .
and that 's why italian lawmakers or german lawmakers should be left to regulate these things and not european lawmakers , " he said . hurdles before it can become binding , the directive must go through another reading and vote in the eu parliament as well as passage by each eu member state in the council of ministers .
however , opponents are expected to take legal action , which would slow down passage . eu commissioner byrne , however , is confident the draft will become law sometime next year . member states would then be required to apply the legislation to their domestic laws by 2005 . the bill does contain one provision that will come as a relief to foreign media companies : publishers and broadcasters outside of the eu will not be required to comply in order to distribute their products within the european union . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking .

the european parliament voted to forbid tobacco advertisements in the media on wednesday .
with millions of euros in advertising at stake for an already struggling media , german parliamentarians are fighting back . in an overwhelming 311-202 vote , the european parliament approved draft legislation on wednesday that marks a first step toward a ban on tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines , radio and the internet . " it 's an important day for public health , " the european union 's health and consumer affairs commissioner , david byrne , told reporters .
" this will help reduce tobacco consumption by removing the image that tobacco is ' cool , " ' he said . the legislation , which still faces many hurdles , could hit the german media market particularly hard .
the cigarette industry spends 60 million euros -lrb- $ 60.1 million -rrb- per year on advertising in germany , the country with the eu 's highest concentration of young smokers . " it 's not necessarily about loosing income " , said thorsten münch , a spokesman for the health commissioner .
when the german publishing tycoon herbert burda met with byrne , he was mainly concerned that a ban on tobacco advertising could lead to further advertising bans , münch told dw-world . though billboard and movie theater ads will still be allowed , byrne 's draft will also stop tobacco companies sponsoring international eu events like concerts , soccer games and formula one car racing . german politicians fume over rules the move also marks byrne 's second attempt at anti-tobacco advertising legislation .

once again , german members of the european parliament voted against the legislation . " europe ca n't declare a ban where there are n't any cross-border conflicts due to competition , " said kurt lechner , a member of the european parliament , explaining the position of many german politicians .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli army on patrol .
the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .
on monday , he declined to comment on the issue , saying that only the federal security council , that met secretly , could decide that .
the security council comprises prominent members of the cabinet , who decide on military exports .
csu confused by deployment of patriot missiles not tanks the conservative opposition in germany offered its opinion in the debate , hinting at hypocrisy in the government 's handling of the ' arms to israel ' affair .
gerd müller , a defense expert with the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , commenting in the berliner morgenpost newspaper , said that it was incomprehensible that the red-green government had agreed to send patriot missile systems to israel but did n't want to send the fuchs .
the messy deal may now have to be rescinded by the german government in yet another damaging admission of incompetence .
according to associated press reports , the israeli defense ministry was said to be very pleased with the german government 's original , although unintentional , offer .
however , an argument is now brewing between the two countries over germany 's commitment to the offer of protection offered to israel .
israel protection deals rumored to placate united states it could backfire further as experts believe that germany 's agreement to aid in the protection of israel is a trade-off with the united states after the chancellor 's continuing refusal to join any military action against iraq .
with warming relations between germany and the u.s. still tepid at best , any obstacle to the bush administration 's plans for the region would be looked on unfavorably .

the conservative opposition parties have decided to go ahead with a committee investigating what they are calling electoral fraud regarding the state of germany 's economy despite dissent within their own ranks , the opposition conservative parties in germany have agreed to set up a parliamentary committee investigating alleged election fraud .

as oil continued to drift towards the coastline , angry locals braved driving rain to get the message out that the government had done too little , too late , in the wake of the tanker 's messy demise .
the people of the province have spent the past two weeks fighting against an initial 6,000-ton slick that came ashore after the prestige , an aging single-hulled tanker registered in liberia and flagged to the bahamas , was holed in storms .
around 5,500 tons have already been pumped from the sea by vessels from belgium , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seabird victim of the oil spill .
the slick has fouled more than 100 beaches to date and forced a fishing ban along 400 kilometers of coastline , crippling the local economy .
an estimated 15,000 seabirds have also been killed or covered in oil since the prestige broke apart .
submarine reveals no immediate threat of further spills then , on sunday , the first patches of oil from the second major slick arrived .
with fears growing that the sunken tanker may spill its remaining load , a french mini-submarine was sent down to the wreck .
the crew found no sign that the estimated 60,000 tons still on board the prestige were leaking - boosting hopes that the fuel had congealed in the freezing ocean depths .
as the cleanup operation along the spanish coast continues in earnest , the european commission on tuesday released a blacklist of 66 ships that it considers to be too dangerous for european waters .
oil and chemical tankers amongst 66 shamed ships the ships , mostly oil and chemical bulk carriers , have been " named and shamed " in an attempt to avoid the further exploitation of lax standards that led to the decrepit prestige entering european waters in such an unsafe condition .
the commission also wants all single-hulled tankers , like the prestige , banned from transporting fuel oil through european waters .
the plans will be discussed by european transport ministers at a summit in copenhagen next week .
blacklisted vessels all have previous warnings on record the dangerous vessels include 26 sailing under the turkish flag while 12 are flagged to st vincent and grenadines in the caribbean and nine to cambodia .
a total of 13 flags are represented .
the commission said all the ships on the list of shame had been detained in european ports on several occasions in the past for failing to comply with safety rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' prestige ' oil tanker .
" words are not enough : it is necessary to act and apply the maritime safety measures in full , " said european transport commissioner loyala de palacio on the bbc .
" safety is the responsibility of everyone and a strict application of all the measures is the only way of ensuring that substandard ships do not fall through the safety net . "
the new tough stance was put to the test over the weekend when the 17-year-old moskovsky festival , carrying 25,000 metric tons of fuel oil from estonia to gibraltar , was ordered out to sea by spanish and portuguese authorities who had expressed concerns about its safety . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans invent super sponge for oil spill cleanup berlin-based eco.carbon has developed a new material that could be used to soak up oil from spills like the tanker disaster in spain last week .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli army on patrol .
the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .
on monday , he declined to comment on the issue , saying that only the federal security council , that met secretly , could decide that .
the security council comprises prominent members of the cabinet , who decide on military exports .
csu confused by deployment of patriot missiles not tanks the conservative opposition in germany offered its opinion in the debate , hinting at hypocrisy in the government 's handling of the ' arms to israel ' affair .
gerd müller , a defense expert with the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , commenting in the berliner morgenpost newspaper , said that it was incomprehensible that the red-green government had agreed to send patriot missile systems to israel but did n't want to send the fuchs .

the conservative opposition parties have decided to go ahead with a committee investigating what they are calling electoral fraud regarding the state of germany 's economy despite dissent within their own ranks , the opposition conservative parties in germany have agreed to set up a parliamentary committee investigating alleged election fraud .
a majority of the christian democratic union / christian social union parliamentary groups voted in favor of launching official proceedings although a number of parliamentarians voiced concern that the committee could be viewed merely as an electioneering instrument .
the committee 's main job will be to investigate what the conservatives are gleefully calling the government 's " broken promises " on tax and spending .
it will want to establish exactly when finance minister hans eichel of the social democrats knew that germany 's budget deficit would break the 3 percent barrier enshrined in the stability and growth pact of the eurozone .
cdu and csu are accusing the government of social democrats and greens of knowingly misleading voters about the state of the country 's finances .
they say the government knew of the rising deficit and a massive shortfall in tax revenue before the september election and kept quiet to avoid defeat at the polls .
" fairness pact " while social democrats and greens have attacked the opposition 's plans , the cdu 's designated committee chairman , peter altmeier , said he was willing to offer the government a " fairness pact . "
if the government was prepared to cooperate , he said , the opposition would make sure its work was done " fairly , swiftly and without personal defamation . "
leading politicians , including eichel and chancellor gerhard schröder , could be called upon to testify .
10-point plan with parliament this week debating next year 's budget , the cdu has put forward its own 10-point plan for more employment and growth in germany .
the blueprint includes a range of proposals making limited jobs and the so-called mini jobs more attractive .
the labor market , the paper says , must be made less bureaucratic .
the cdu estimates that its proposals could lead to the creation of 250,000 jobs within one year .
the first day of the budgetary debate was characterized by a heated exchange between the government and the opposition with both sides accusing the other of deceiving the electorate .
eichel defended his financial policies arguing that interest debt payments were considerably lower for this year and next than three years ago .
eichel said this was a sign that his " policy of consolidating the state 's finances was a success . "
however , he admitted that unemployment in germany would rise above the four-million mark this winter .
friedrich merz , the cdu parliamentary group 's spokesman for budgetary and financial affairs , once again accused the government of deceiving voters about tax revenue forecasts .
the government , he said , knew of the likely shortfall well before the september general election .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .

further fdp politicians , including wolfgang gerhardt , currently head of the party 's parliamentary group , have also been implicated . fifty-seven-year-old möllemann , who served as the fdp 's state party chairman in north rhine-westphalia , has been under fire since allegations surfaced in october that he maintained illegal party bank accounts to the tune of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . möllemann used the funds in part for an anti-israeli campaign pamphlet in which he virulently attacked israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's actions and accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of inciting anti-semitism .
the leaflet cost € 8 million -lrb- $ 7.95 million -rrb- and was distributed to most households in north rhine-westphalia before the german general election days before the sept .
22 election .
party leaders have blamed the fdp 's bad showing in the election , in which it only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote , on the bad press surrounding the leaflet . federal probe prosecutors opened a probe into möllemann 's affairs in november .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament for violating party funding laws . the local party headquarters in north rhine-westphalia has also called on möllemann to resign from his mandate in the provincial parliament .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .

the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli army on patrol .
the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .
on monday , he declined to comment on the issue , saying that only the federal security council , that met secretly , could decide that .

the conservative opposition parties have decided to go ahead with a committee investigating what they are calling electoral fraud regarding the state of germany 's economy despite dissent within their own ranks , the opposition conservative parties in germany have agreed to set up a parliamentary committee investigating alleged election fraud .
a majority of the christian democratic union / christian social union parliamentary groups voted in favor of launching official proceedings although a number of parliamentarians voiced concern that the committee could be viewed merely as an electioneering instrument .
the committee 's main job will be to investigate what the conservatives are gleefully calling the government 's " broken promises " on tax and spending .
it will want to establish exactly when finance minister hans eichel of the social democrats knew that germany 's budget deficit would break the 3 percent barrier enshrined in the stability and growth pact of the eurozone .
cdu and csu are accusing the government of social democrats and greens of knowingly misleading voters about the state of the country 's finances .
they say the government knew of the rising deficit and a massive shortfall in tax revenue before the september election and kept quiet to avoid defeat at the polls .
" fairness pact " while social democrats and greens have attacked the opposition 's plans , the cdu 's designated committee chairman , peter altmeier , said he was willing to offer the government a " fairness pact . "
if the government was prepared to cooperate , he said , the opposition would make sure its work was done " fairly , swiftly and without personal defamation . "
leading politicians , including eichel and chancellor gerhard schröder , could be called upon to testify .
10-point plan with parliament this week debating next year 's budget , the cdu has put forward its own 10-point plan for more employment and growth in germany .
the blueprint includes a range of proposals making limited jobs and the so-called mini jobs more attractive .

the cdu estimates that its proposals could lead to the creation of 250,000 jobs within one year .

the european parliament voted to forbid tobacco advertisements in the media on wednesday .
with millions of euros in advertising at stake for an already struggling media , german parliamentarians are fighting back . in an overwhelming 311-202 vote , the european parliament approved draft legislation on wednesday that marks a first step toward a ban on tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines , radio and the internet . " it 's an important day for public health , " the european union 's health and consumer affairs commissioner , david byrne , told reporters .
" this will help reduce tobacco consumption by removing the image that tobacco is ' cool , " ' he said . the legislation , which still faces many hurdles , could hit the german media market particularly hard .
the cigarette industry spends 60 million euros -lrb- $ 60.1 million -rrb- per year on advertising in germany , the country with the eu 's highest concentration of young smokers . " it 's not necessarily about loosing income " , said thorsten münch , a spokesman for the health commissioner .
when the german publishing tycoon herbert burda met with byrne , he was mainly concerned that a ban on tobacco advertising could lead to further advertising bans , münch told dw-world . though billboard and movie theater ads will still be allowed , byrne 's draft will also stop tobacco companies sponsoring international eu events like concerts , soccer games and formula one car racing . german politicians fume over rules the move also marks byrne 's second attempt at anti-tobacco advertising legislation .
following considerable criticism from germany and other eu member states , the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- quashed a similar directive two years ago , ruling that it overstepped the eu 's jurisdiction .
once again , german members of the european parliament voted against the legislation . " europe ca n't declare a ban where there are n't any cross-border conflicts due to competition , " said kurt lechner , a member of the european parliament , explaining the position of many german politicians .
" in the german market , german newspapers compete with each other .
but there is n't any serious competition between italian newspapers and german newspapers .
and that 's why italian lawmakers or german lawmakers should be left to regulate these things and not european lawmakers , " he said . hurdles before it can become binding , the directive must go through another reading and vote in the eu parliament as well as passage by each eu member state in the council of ministers .
however , opponents are expected to take legal action , which would slow down passage . eu commissioner byrne , however , is confident the draft will become law sometime next year . member states would then be required to apply the legislation to their domestic laws by 2005 . the bill does contain one provision that will come as a relief to foreign media companies : publishers and broadcasters outside of the eu will not be required to comply in order to distribute their products within the european union . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking .

the european parliament voted to forbid tobacco advertisements in the media on wednesday .
with millions of euros in advertising at stake for an already struggling media , german parliamentarians are fighting back . in an overwhelming 311-202 vote , the european parliament approved draft legislation on wednesday that marks a first step toward a ban on tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines , radio and the internet . " it 's an important day for public health , " the european union 's health and consumer affairs commissioner , david byrne , told reporters .
" this will help reduce tobacco consumption by removing the image that tobacco is ' cool , " ' he said . the legislation , which still faces many hurdles , could hit the german media market particularly hard .
the cigarette industry spends 60 million euros -lrb- $ 60.1 million -rrb- per year on advertising in germany , the country with the eu 's highest concentration of young smokers . " it 's not necessarily about loosing income " , said thorsten münch , a spokesman for the health commissioner .
when the german publishing tycoon herbert burda met with byrne , he was mainly concerned that a ban on tobacco advertising could lead to further advertising bans , münch told dw-world . though billboard and movie theater ads will still be allowed , byrne 's draft will also stop tobacco companies sponsoring international eu events like concerts , soccer games and formula one car racing . german politicians fume over rules the move also marks byrne 's second attempt at anti-tobacco advertising legislation .
following considerable criticism from germany and other eu member states , the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- quashed a similar directive two years ago , ruling that it overstepped the eu 's jurisdiction .
once again , german members of the european parliament voted against the legislation . " europe ca n't declare a ban where there are n't any cross-border conflicts due to competition , " said kurt lechner , a member of the european parliament , explaining the position of many german politicians .
" in the german market , german newspapers compete with each other .
but there is n't any serious competition between italian newspapers and german newspapers .
and that 's why italian lawmakers or german lawmakers should be left to regulate these things and not european lawmakers , " he said . hurdles before it can become binding , the directive must go through another reading and vote in the eu parliament as well as passage by each eu member state in the council of ministers .
however , opponents are expected to take legal action , which would slow down passage . eu commissioner byrne , however , is confident the draft will become law sometime next year . member states would then be required to apply the legislation to their domestic laws by 2005 . the bill does contain one provision that will come as a relief to foreign media companies : publishers and broadcasters outside of the eu will not be required to comply in order to distribute their products within the european union . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking .

the european parliament voted to forbid tobacco advertisements in the media on wednesday .
with millions of euros in advertising at stake for an already struggling media , german parliamentarians are fighting back . in an overwhelming 311-202 vote , the european parliament approved draft legislation on wednesday that marks a first step toward a ban on tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines , radio and the internet . " it 's an important day for public health , " the european union 's health and consumer affairs commissioner , david byrne , told reporters .
" this will help reduce tobacco consumption by removing the image that tobacco is ' cool , " ' he said . the legislation , which still faces many hurdles , could hit the german media market particularly hard .
the cigarette industry spends 60 million euros -lrb- $ 60.1 million -rrb- per year on advertising in germany , the country with the eu 's highest concentration of young smokers . " it 's not necessarily about loosing income " , said thorsten münch , a spokesman for the health commissioner .
when the german publishing tycoon herbert burda met with byrne , he was mainly concerned that a ban on tobacco advertising could lead to further advertising bans , münch told dw-world . though billboard and movie theater ads will still be allowed , byrne 's draft will also stop tobacco companies sponsoring international eu events like concerts , soccer games and formula one car racing . german politicians fume over rules the move also marks byrne 's second attempt at anti-tobacco advertising legislation .
following considerable criticism from germany and other eu member states , the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- quashed a similar directive two years ago , ruling that it overstepped the eu 's jurisdiction .
once again , german members of the european parliament voted against the legislation . " europe ca n't declare a ban where there are n't any cross-border conflicts due to competition , " said kurt lechner , a member of the european parliament , explaining the position of many german politicians .
" in the german market , german newspapers compete with each other .
but there is n't any serious competition between italian newspapers and german newspapers .
and that 's why italian lawmakers or german lawmakers should be left to regulate these things and not european lawmakers , " he said . hurdles before it can become binding , the directive must go through another reading and vote in the eu parliament as well as passage by each eu member state in the council of ministers .
however , opponents are expected to take legal action , which would slow down passage . eu commissioner byrne , however , is confident the draft will become law sometime next year . member states would then be required to apply the legislation to their domestic laws by 2005 . the bill does contain one provision that will come as a relief to foreign media companies : publishers and broadcasters outside of the eu will not be required to comply in order to distribute their products within the european union . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking .

following considerable criticism from germany and other eu member states , the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- quashed a similar directive two years ago , ruling that it overstepped the eu 's jurisdiction .
once again , german members of the european parliament voted against the legislation . " europe ca n't declare a ban where there are n't any cross-border conflicts due to competition , " said kurt lechner , a member of the european parliament , explaining the position of many german politicians .
" in the german market , german newspapers compete with each other .
but there is n't any serious competition between italian newspapers and german newspapers .
and that 's why italian lawmakers or german lawmakers should be left to regulate these things and not european lawmakers , " he said . hurdles before it can become binding , the directive must go through another reading and vote in the eu parliament as well as passage by each eu member state in the council of ministers .
however , opponents are expected to take legal action , which would slow down passage . eu commissioner byrne , however , is confident the draft will become law sometime next year . member states would then be required to apply the legislation to their domestic laws by 2005 . the bill does contain one provision that will come as a relief to foreign media companies : publishers and broadcasters outside of the eu will not be required to comply in order to distribute their products within the european union . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking .

the conservative opposition parties have decided to go ahead with a committee investigating what they are calling electoral fraud regarding the state of germany 's economy despite dissent within their own ranks , the opposition conservative parties in germany have agreed to set up a parliamentary committee investigating alleged election fraud .
a majority of the christian democratic union / christian social union parliamentary groups voted in favor of launching official proceedings although a number of parliamentarians voiced concern that the committee could be viewed merely as an electioneering instrument .
the committee 's main job will be to investigate what the conservatives are gleefully calling the government 's " broken promises " on tax and spending .
it will want to establish exactly when finance minister hans eichel of the social democrats knew that germany 's budget deficit would break the 3 percent barrier enshrined in the stability and growth pact of the eurozone .
cdu and csu are accusing the government of social democrats and greens of knowingly misleading voters about the state of the country 's finances .
they say the government knew of the rising deficit and a massive shortfall in tax revenue before the september election and kept quiet to avoid defeat at the polls .
" fairness pact " while social democrats and greens have attacked the opposition 's plans , the cdu 's designated committee chairman , peter altmeier , said he was willing to offer the government a " fairness pact . "
if the government was prepared to cooperate , he said , the opposition would make sure its work was done " fairly , swiftly and without personal defamation . "
leading politicians , including eichel and chancellor gerhard schröder , could be called upon to testify .
10-point plan with parliament this week debating next year 's budget , the cdu has put forward its own 10-point plan for more employment and growth in germany .
the blueprint includes a range of proposals making limited jobs and the so-called mini jobs more attractive .
the labor market , the paper says , must be made less bureaucratic .
the cdu estimates that its proposals could lead to the creation of 250,000 jobs within one year .
the first day of the budgetary debate was characterized by a heated exchange between the government and the opposition with both sides accusing the other of deceiving the electorate .
eichel defended his financial policies arguing that interest debt payments were considerably lower for this year and next than three years ago .
eichel said this was a sign that his " policy of consolidating the state 's finances was a success . "
however , he admitted that unemployment in germany would rise above the four-million mark this winter .
friedrich merz , the cdu parliamentary group 's spokesman for budgetary and financial affairs , once again accused the government of deceiving voters about tax revenue forecasts .
the government , he said , knew of the likely shortfall well before the september general election .
schröder takes initiative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder meanwhile , chancellor schröder , who has been keeping a low profile over the past weeks , has decided to go on the offensive .
he is set to use wednesday 's traditional budgetary speech to outline the country 's problems and possible solutions . his change of stance comes after numerous social democratic deputies complained that the government had failed to send out a coherent and concise message to voters on the state of germany 's economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cabinet approves 2003 budget chancellor gerhard schröder 's government approved the draft federal budget for 2003 on wednesday .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli army on patrol .
the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .
on monday , he declined to comment on the issue , saying that only the federal security council , that met secretly , could decide that .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .

the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2002 opposition to target german government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister clement -lrb- left -rrb- and finance minister eichel need to get their sums right .
the conservative opposition parties have decided to go ahead with a committee investigating what they are calling electoral fraud regarding the state of germany 's economy despite dissent within their own ranks , the opposition conservative parties in germany have agreed to set up a parliamentary committee investigating alleged election fraud .
a majority of the christian democratic union / christian social union parliamentary groups voted in favor of launching official proceedings although a number of parliamentarians voiced concern that the committee could be viewed merely as an electioneering instrument .
the committee 's main job will be to investigate what the conservatives are gleefully calling the government 's " broken promises " on tax and spending .
it will want to establish exactly when finance minister hans eichel of the social democrats knew that germany 's budget deficit would break the 3 percent barrier enshrined in the stability and growth pact of the eurozone .
cdu and csu are accusing the government of social democrats and greens of knowingly misleading voters about the state of the country 's finances .
they say the government knew of the rising deficit and a massive shortfall in tax revenue before the september election and kept quiet to avoid defeat at the polls .
" fairness pact " while social democrats and greens have attacked the opposition 's plans , the cdu 's designated committee chairman , peter altmeier , said he was willing to offer the government a " fairness pact . "
if the government was prepared to cooperate , he said , the opposition would make sure its work was done " fairly , swiftly and without personal defamation . "
leading politicians , including eichel and chancellor gerhard schröder , could be called upon to testify .
10-point plan with parliament this week debating next year 's budget , the cdu has put forward its own 10-point plan for more employment and growth in germany .
the blueprint includes a range of proposals making limited jobs and the so-called mini jobs more attractive .
the labor market , the paper says , must be made less bureaucratic .
the cdu estimates that its proposals could lead to the creation of 250,000 jobs within one year .
the first day of the budgetary debate was characterized by a heated exchange between the government and the opposition with both sides accusing the other of deceiving the electorate .
eichel defended his financial policies arguing that interest debt payments were considerably lower for this year and next than three years ago .
eichel said this was a sign that his " policy of consolidating the state 's finances was a success . "
however , he admitted that unemployment in germany would rise above the four-million mark this winter .

the conservative opposition parties have decided to go ahead with a committee investigating what they are calling electoral fraud regarding the state of germany 's economy despite dissent within their own ranks , the opposition conservative parties in germany have agreed to set up a parliamentary committee investigating alleged election fraud .
a majority of the christian democratic union / christian social union parliamentary groups voted in favor of launching official proceedings although a number of parliamentarians voiced concern that the committee could be viewed merely as an electioneering instrument .
the committee 's main job will be to investigate what the conservatives are gleefully calling the government 's " broken promises " on tax and spending .
it will want to establish exactly when finance minister hans eichel of the social democrats knew that germany 's budget deficit would break the 3 percent barrier enshrined in the stability and growth pact of the eurozone .
cdu and csu are accusing the government of social democrats and greens of knowingly misleading voters about the state of the country 's finances .
they say the government knew of the rising deficit and a massive shortfall in tax revenue before the september election and kept quiet to avoid defeat at the polls .
" fairness pact " while social democrats and greens have attacked the opposition 's plans , the cdu 's designated committee chairman , peter altmeier , said he was willing to offer the government a " fairness pact . "
if the government was prepared to cooperate , he said , the opposition would make sure its work was done " fairly , swiftly and without personal defamation . "
leading politicians , including eichel and chancellor gerhard schröder , could be called upon to testify .
10-point plan with parliament this week debating next year 's budget , the cdu has put forward its own 10-point plan for more employment and growth in germany .
the blueprint includes a range of proposals making limited jobs and the so-called mini jobs more attractive .
the labor market , the paper says , must be made less bureaucratic .
the cdu estimates that its proposals could lead to the creation of 250,000 jobs within one year .
the first day of the budgetary debate was characterized by a heated exchange between the government and the opposition with both sides accusing the other of deceiving the electorate .
eichel defended his financial policies arguing that interest debt payments were considerably lower for this year and next than three years ago .
eichel said this was a sign that his " policy of consolidating the state 's finances was a success . "

as oil continued to drift towards the coastline , angry locals braved driving rain to get the message out that the government had done too little , too late , in the wake of the tanker 's messy demise .

the conservative opposition parties have decided to go ahead with a committee investigating what they are calling electoral fraud regarding the state of germany 's economy despite dissent within their own ranks , the opposition conservative parties in germany have agreed to set up a parliamentary committee investigating alleged election fraud .
a majority of the christian democratic union / christian social union parliamentary groups voted in favor of launching official proceedings although a number of parliamentarians voiced concern that the committee could be viewed merely as an electioneering instrument .
the committee 's main job will be to investigate what the conservatives are gleefully calling the government 's " broken promises " on tax and spending .
it will want to establish exactly when finance minister hans eichel of the social democrats knew that germany 's budget deficit would break the 3 percent barrier enshrined in the stability and growth pact of the eurozone .
cdu and csu are accusing the government of social democrats and greens of knowingly misleading voters about the state of the country 's finances .
they say the government knew of the rising deficit and a massive shortfall in tax revenue before the september election and kept quiet to avoid defeat at the polls .
" fairness pact " while social democrats and greens have attacked the opposition 's plans , the cdu 's designated committee chairman , peter altmeier , said he was willing to offer the government a " fairness pact . "
if the government was prepared to cooperate , he said , the opposition would make sure its work was done " fairly , swiftly and without personal defamation . "
leading politicians , including eichel and chancellor gerhard schröder , could be called upon to testify .
10-point plan with parliament this week debating next year 's budget , the cdu has put forward its own 10-point plan for more employment and growth in germany .
the blueprint includes a range of proposals making limited jobs and the so-called mini jobs more attractive .
the labor market , the paper says , must be made less bureaucratic .
the cdu estimates that its proposals could lead to the creation of 250,000 jobs within one year .
the first day of the budgetary debate was characterized by a heated exchange between the government and the opposition with both sides accusing the other of deceiving the electorate .
eichel defended his financial policies arguing that interest debt payments were considerably lower for this year and next than three years ago .
eichel said this was a sign that his " policy of consolidating the state 's finances was a success . "
however , he admitted that unemployment in germany would rise above the four-million mark this winter .
friedrich merz , the cdu parliamentary group 's spokesman for budgetary and financial affairs , once again accused the government of deceiving voters about tax revenue forecasts .
the government , he said , knew of the likely shortfall well before the september general election .
schröder takes initiative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder meanwhile , chancellor schröder , who has been keeping a low profile over the past weeks , has decided to go on the offensive .
he is set to use wednesday 's traditional budgetary speech to outline the country 's problems and possible solutions . his change of stance comes after numerous social democratic deputies complained that the government had failed to send out a coherent and concise message to voters on the state of germany 's economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cabinet approves 2003 budget chancellor gerhard schröder 's government approved the draft federal budget for 2003 on wednesday .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli army on patrol .
the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .
on monday , he declined to comment on the issue , saying that only the federal security council , that met secretly , could decide that .
the security council comprises prominent members of the cabinet , who decide on military exports .
csu confused by deployment of patriot missiles not tanks the conservative opposition in germany offered its opinion in the debate , hinting at hypocrisy in the government 's handling of the ' arms to israel ' affair .
gerd müller , a defense expert with the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , commenting in the berliner morgenpost newspaper , said that it was incomprehensible that the red-green government had agreed to send patriot missile systems to israel but did n't want to send the fuchs .
the messy deal may now have to be rescinded by the german government in yet another damaging admission of incompetence .
according to associated press reports , the israeli defense ministry was said to be very pleased with the german government 's original , although unintentional , offer .
however , an argument is now brewing between the two countries over germany 's commitment to the offer of protection offered to israel .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli army on patrol .
the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .
on monday , he declined to comment on the issue , saying that only the federal security council , that met secretly , could decide that .
the security council comprises prominent members of the cabinet , who decide on military exports .
csu confused by deployment of patriot missiles not tanks the conservative opposition in germany offered its opinion in the debate , hinting at hypocrisy in the government 's handling of the ' arms to israel ' affair .
gerd müller , a defense expert with the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , commenting in the berliner morgenpost newspaper , said that it was incomprehensible that the red-green government had agreed to send patriot missile systems to israel but did n't want to send the fuchs .
the messy deal may now have to be rescinded by the german government in yet another damaging admission of incompetence .
according to associated press reports , the israeli defense ministry was said to be very pleased with the german government 's original , although unintentional , offer .
however , an argument is now brewing between the two countries over germany 's commitment to the offer of protection offered to israel .
israel protection deals rumored to placate united states it could backfire further as experts believe that germany 's agreement to aid in the protection of israel is a trade-off with the united states after the chancellor 's continuing refusal to join any military action against iraq .
with warming relations between germany and the u.s. still tepid at best , any obstacle to the bush administration 's plans for the region would be looked on unfavorably .

the fdp launches proceedings to expel a notorious publicity-seeker in the wake of the central role he played in a campaign finance scandal and offensive campaign leaflet . germany 's business-friendly free democratic party voted on monday to bar former vice-chairman jürgen möllemann from party membership . fdp leaders voted 35-28 in favor of beginning expulsion proceedings against möllemann in berlin .
möllemann has been accused of damaging the fdp 's reputation and abusing the party 's fundamental principles . he " wanted to make his own politics , but not those of the fdp , " party leader guido westerwelle said in berlin after the vote . merely a scapegoat ? germany 's chancellor and social democratic leader , gerhard schröder , however , alleged that möllemann is merely a scapegoat meant to distract attention from the fdp 's role in the finance scandal that emerged in november .
further fdp politicians , including wolfgang gerhardt , currently head of the party 's parliamentary group , have also been implicated . fifty-seven-year-old möllemann , who served as the fdp 's state party chairman in north rhine-westphalia , has been under fire since allegations surfaced in october that he maintained illegal party bank accounts to the tune of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . möllemann used the funds in part for an anti-israeli campaign pamphlet in which he virulently attacked israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's actions and accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of inciting anti-semitism .
the leaflet cost € 8 million -lrb- $ 7.95 million -rrb- and was distributed to most households in north rhine-westphalia before the german general election days before the sept .
22 election .
party leaders have blamed the fdp 's bad showing in the election , in which it only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote , on the bad press surrounding the leaflet . federal probe prosecutors opened a probe into möllemann 's affairs in november .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament for violating party funding laws . the local party headquarters in north rhine-westphalia has also called on möllemann to resign from his mandate in the provincial parliament .
otherwise , it too will begin proceedings to expel him . möllemann has been an fdp member for 32 years and even served as a cabinet minister in former chancellor helmut kohl 's administration during better days . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's free democrats want möllemann out the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli army on patrol .
the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .
on monday , he declined to comment on the issue , saying that only the federal security council , that met secretly , could decide that .
the security council comprises prominent members of the cabinet , who decide on military exports .
csu confused by deployment of patriot missiles not tanks the conservative opposition in germany offered its opinion in the debate , hinting at hypocrisy in the government 's handling of the ' arms to israel ' affair .
gerd müller , a defense expert with the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , commenting in the berliner morgenpost newspaper , said that it was incomprehensible that the red-green government had agreed to send patriot missile systems to israel but did n't want to send the fuchs .
the messy deal may now have to be rescinded by the german government in yet another damaging admission of incompetence .
according to associated press reports , the israeli defense ministry was said to be very pleased with the german government 's original , although unintentional , offer .
however , an argument is now brewing between the two countries over germany 's commitment to the offer of protection offered to israel .
israel protection deals rumored to placate united states it could backfire further as experts believe that germany 's agreement to aid in the protection of israel is a trade-off with the united states after the chancellor 's continuing refusal to join any military action against iraq .
with warming relations between germany and the u.s. still tepid at best , any obstacle to the bush administration 's plans for the region would be looked on unfavorably .

a majority of the christian democratic union / christian social union parliamentary groups voted in favor of launching official proceedings although a number of parliamentarians voiced concern that the committee could be viewed merely as an electioneering instrument .
the committee 's main job will be to investigate what the conservatives are gleefully calling the government 's " broken promises " on tax and spending .
it will want to establish exactly when finance minister hans eichel of the social democrats knew that germany 's budget deficit would break the 3 percent barrier enshrined in the stability and growth pact of the eurozone .
cdu and csu are accusing the government of social democrats and greens of knowingly misleading voters about the state of the country 's finances .
they say the government knew of the rising deficit and a massive shortfall in tax revenue before the september election and kept quiet to avoid defeat at the polls .
" fairness pact " while social democrats and greens have attacked the opposition 's plans , the cdu 's designated committee chairman , peter altmeier , said he was willing to offer the government a " fairness pact . "
if the government was prepared to cooperate , he said , the opposition would make sure its work was done " fairly , swiftly and without personal defamation . "
leading politicians , including eichel and chancellor gerhard schröder , could be called upon to testify .

the cdu estimates that its proposals could lead to the creation of 250,000 jobs within one year .
the first day of the budgetary debate was characterized by a heated exchange between the government and the opposition with both sides accusing the other of deceiving the electorate .
eichel defended his financial policies arguing that interest debt payments were considerably lower for this year and next than three years ago .
eichel said this was a sign that his " policy of consolidating the state 's finances was a success . "
however , he admitted that unemployment in germany would rise above the four-million mark this winter .
friedrich merz , the cdu parliamentary group 's spokesman for budgetary and financial affairs , once again accused the government of deceiving voters about tax revenue forecasts .
the government , he said , knew of the likely shortfall well before the september general election .

the fdp launches proceedings to expel a notorious publicity-seeker in the wake of the central role he played in a campaign finance scandal and offensive campaign leaflet . germany 's business-friendly free democratic party voted on monday to bar former vice-chairman jürgen möllemann from party membership . fdp leaders voted 35-28 in favor of beginning expulsion proceedings against möllemann in berlin .

further fdp politicians , including wolfgang gerhardt , currently head of the party 's parliamentary group , have also been implicated . fifty-seven-year-old möllemann , who served as the fdp 's state party chairman in north rhine-westphalia , has been under fire since allegations surfaced in october that he maintained illegal party bank accounts to the tune of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . möllemann used the funds in part for an anti-israeli campaign pamphlet in which he virulently attacked israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's actions and accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of inciting anti-semitism .
the leaflet cost € 8 million -lrb- $ 7.95 million -rrb- and was distributed to most households in north rhine-westphalia before the german general election days before the sept .
22 election .
party leaders have blamed the fdp 's bad showing in the election , in which it only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote , on the bad press surrounding the leaflet . federal probe prosecutors opened a probe into möllemann 's affairs in november .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament for violating party funding laws . the local party headquarters in north rhine-westphalia has also called on möllemann to resign from his mandate in the provincial parliament .
otherwise , it too will begin proceedings to expel him . möllemann has been an fdp member for 32 years and even served as a cabinet minister in former chancellor helmut kohl 's administration during better days . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's free democrats want möllemann out the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation .

as oil continued to drift towards the coastline , angry locals braved driving rain to get the message out that the government had done too little , too late , in the wake of the tanker 's messy demise .
the people of the province have spent the past two weeks fighting against an initial 6,000-ton slick that came ashore after the prestige , an aging single-hulled tanker registered in liberia and flagged to the bahamas , was holed in storms .
around 5,500 tons have already been pumped from the sea by vessels from belgium , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seabird victim of the oil spill .
the slick has fouled more than 100 beaches to date and forced a fishing ban along 400 kilometers of coastline , crippling the local economy .
an estimated 15,000 seabirds have also been killed or covered in oil since the prestige broke apart .
submarine reveals no immediate threat of further spills then , on sunday , the first patches of oil from the second major slick arrived .
with fears growing that the sunken tanker may spill its remaining load , a french mini-submarine was sent down to the wreck .
the crew found no sign that the estimated 60,000 tons still on board the prestige were leaking - boosting hopes that the fuel had congealed in the freezing ocean depths .
as the cleanup operation along the spanish coast continues in earnest , the european commission on tuesday released a blacklist of 66 ships that it considers to be too dangerous for european waters .
oil and chemical tankers amongst 66 shamed ships the ships , mostly oil and chemical bulk carriers , have been " named and shamed " in an attempt to avoid the further exploitation of lax standards that led to the decrepit prestige entering european waters in such an unsafe condition .
the commission also wants all single-hulled tankers , like the prestige , banned from transporting fuel oil through european waters .
the plans will be discussed by european transport ministers at a summit in copenhagen next week .
blacklisted vessels all have previous warnings on record the dangerous vessels include 26 sailing under the turkish flag while 12 are flagged to st vincent and grenadines in the caribbean and nine to cambodia .
a total of 13 flags are represented .
the commission said all the ships on the list of shame had been detained in european ports on several occasions in the past for failing to comply with safety rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' prestige ' oil tanker .
" words are not enough : it is necessary to act and apply the maritime safety measures in full , " said european transport commissioner loyala de palacio on the bbc .
" safety is the responsibility of everyone and a strict application of all the measures is the only way of ensuring that substandard ships do not fall through the safety net . "
the new tough stance was put to the test over the weekend when the 17-year-old moskovsky festival , carrying 25,000 metric tons of fuel oil from estonia to gibraltar , was ordered out to sea by spanish and portuguese authorities who had expressed concerns about its safety . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans invent super sponge for oil spill cleanup berlin-based eco.carbon has developed a new material that could be used to soak up oil from spills like the tanker disaster in spain last week .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli army on patrol .
the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .
on monday , he declined to comment on the issue , saying that only the federal security council , that met secretly , could decide that .
the security council comprises prominent members of the cabinet , who decide on military exports .
csu confused by deployment of patriot missiles not tanks the conservative opposition in germany offered its opinion in the debate , hinting at hypocrisy in the government 's handling of the ' arms to israel ' affair .
gerd müller , a defense expert with the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , commenting in the berliner morgenpost newspaper , said that it was incomprehensible that the red-green government had agreed to send patriot missile systems to israel but did n't want to send the fuchs .

chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on . the confusion surrounding germany 's decision to provide fuchs armored vehicles to israel to protect itself from attack by weapons of mass destruction has prompted opposition from the government 's supporters and detractors alike .
after an embarrassing series of bungles that led to the wrong armored vehicles being offered to israel , gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have now come under fire from their green coalition partners and members of the opposition .
as part of a package to help defend israel from any attack from iraq in the case of war , germany had offered to send its enhanced fuchs armored vehicles - a defensive model which is equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination - to be used in the protection of israel ’ s own population .
defensive model confused with fuchs troop transporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs armored car .
in a blunder later blamed on a misread fax , germany appeared to offer a different variant of the armored vehicle than the defensive one .
it emerged later that the israelis had placed an order for the standard fuchs tank , not the enhanced version with weapons-detecting electronics .
the standard fuchs is an armored personnel carrier , capable of carrying 10 soldiers , which analysts say is ideal for the kind of urban military incursions that israel has been carrying out in the west bank and gaza .
opposing politicians have reacted angrily saying that selling this version of the tank to israel would almost certainly violate a national law prohibiting the sale of weapons to countries involved in political or military conflicts .
greens express fears that fuchs will be used in conflict the junior coalition partners in the government , the greens have collectively called for a resounding ' no ' to the sale of the armored vehicles , fearing their possible use against palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip .
party leader claudia roth made it clear in berlin on monday that the deployment of the fuchs vehicles should be forbidden if there is even a suspicion that they would be used in any aggressive operations , including the suppression of the current intifada .
" our position in that regard is very clear , " she said .
" it would be very difficult to approve this because i think everybody will have this picture of the west bank and gaza strip in their heads , " said gernot erler , an expert on foreign affairs and defense , who represents schröder 's social democratic party in the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli army on patrol .
the israeli defense ministry was reported as saying in the german daily bild zeitung that the armored vehicles would not be used against the palestinians .
a spokesperson for the ministry in jerusalem said that the vehicles would be used as intended - as transporters - and would not be used in the conflict or in the demolition of palestinian houses .
chancellor schröder has still not come out with an official statement on the fuchs affair .
on monday , he declined to comment on the issue , saying that only the federal security council , that met secretly , could decide that .
the security council comprises prominent members of the cabinet , who decide on military exports .
csu confused by deployment of patriot missiles not tanks the conservative opposition in germany offered its opinion in the debate , hinting at hypocrisy in the government 's handling of the ' arms to israel ' affair .
gerd müller , a defense expert with the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , commenting in the berliner morgenpost newspaper , said that it was incomprehensible that the red-green government had agreed to send patriot missile systems to israel but did n't want to send the fuchs .
the messy deal may now have to be rescinded by the german government in yet another damaging admission of incompetence .
according to associated press reports , the israeli defense ministry was said to be very pleased with the german government 's original , although unintentional , offer .

the european parliament voted to forbid tobacco advertisements in the media on wednesday .
with millions of euros in advertising at stake for an already struggling media , german parliamentarians are fighting back . in an overwhelming 311-202 vote , the european parliament approved draft legislation on wednesday that marks a first step toward a ban on tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines , radio and the internet . " it 's an important day for public health , " the european union 's health and consumer affairs commissioner , david byrne , told reporters .
" this will help reduce tobacco consumption by removing the image that tobacco is ' cool , " ' he said . the legislation , which still faces many hurdles , could hit the german media market particularly hard .
the cigarette industry spends 60 million euros -lrb- $ 60.1 million -rrb- per year on advertising in germany , the country with the eu 's highest concentration of young smokers . " it 's not necessarily about loosing income " , said thorsten münch , a spokesman for the health commissioner .
when the german publishing tycoon herbert burda met with byrne , he was mainly concerned that a ban on tobacco advertising could lead to further advertising bans , münch told dw-world . though billboard and movie theater ads will still be allowed , byrne 's draft will also stop tobacco companies sponsoring international eu events like concerts , soccer games and formula one car racing . german politicians fume over rules the move also marks byrne 's second attempt at anti-tobacco advertising legislation .
following considerable criticism from germany and other eu member states , the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- quashed a similar directive two years ago , ruling that it overstepped the eu 's jurisdiction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.12.2002 free democrats vote to oust troublemaker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen möllemann faces expulsion from the party he 's represented for 32 years .
the fdp launches proceedings to expel a notorious publicity-seeker in the wake of the central role he played in a campaign finance scandal and offensive campaign leaflet . germany 's business-friendly free democratic party voted on monday to bar former vice-chairman jürgen möllemann from party membership . fdp leaders voted 35-28 in favor of beginning expulsion proceedings against möllemann in berlin .
möllemann has been accused of damaging the fdp 's reputation and abusing the party 's fundamental principles . he " wanted to make his own politics , but not those of the fdp , " party leader guido westerwelle said in berlin after the vote . merely a scapegoat ? germany 's chancellor and social democratic leader , gerhard schröder , however , alleged that möllemann is merely a scapegoat meant to distract attention from the fdp 's role in the finance scandal that emerged in november .
further fdp politicians , including wolfgang gerhardt , currently head of the party 's parliamentary group , have also been implicated . fifty-seven-year-old möllemann , who served as the fdp 's state party chairman in north rhine-westphalia , has been under fire since allegations surfaced in october that he maintained illegal party bank accounts to the tune of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . möllemann used the funds in part for an anti-israeli campaign pamphlet in which he virulently attacked israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's actions and accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of inciting anti-semitism .
the leaflet cost € 8 million -lrb- $ 7.95 million -rrb- and was distributed to most households in north rhine-westphalia before the german general election days before the sept .
22 election .
party leaders have blamed the fdp 's bad showing in the election , in which it only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote , on the bad press surrounding the leaflet . federal probe prosecutors opened a probe into möllemann 's affairs in november .
the fdp has already had to pay an € 873,500 fine to the federal parliament for violating party funding laws . the local party headquarters in north rhine-westphalia has also called on möllemann to resign from his mandate in the provincial parliament .
otherwise , it too will begin proceedings to expel him . möllemann has been an fdp member for 32 years and even served as a cabinet minister in former chancellor helmut kohl 's administration during better days . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's free democrats want möllemann out the fdp wants to expel jürgen möllemann , the figure at the heart of an illegal funding campaign , which has badly damaged the liberals ' reputation .

the fdp launches proceedings to expel a notorious publicity-seeker in the wake of the central role he played in a campaign finance scandal and offensive campaign leaflet . germany 's business-friendly free democratic party voted on monday to bar former vice-chairman jürgen möllemann from party membership . fdp leaders voted 35-28 in favor of beginning expulsion proceedings against möllemann in berlin .
möllemann has been accused of damaging the fdp 's reputation and abusing the party 's fundamental principles . he " wanted to make his own politics , but not those of the fdp , " party leader guido westerwelle said in berlin after the vote . merely a scapegoat ? germany 's chancellor and social democratic leader , gerhard schröder , however , alleged that möllemann is merely a scapegoat meant to distract attention from the fdp 's role in the finance scandal that emerged in november .
further fdp politicians , including wolfgang gerhardt , currently head of the party 's parliamentary group , have also been implicated . fifty-seven-year-old möllemann , who served as the fdp 's state party chairman in north rhine-westphalia , has been under fire since allegations surfaced in october that he maintained illegal party bank accounts to the tune of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . möllemann used the funds in part for an anti-israeli campaign pamphlet in which he virulently attacked israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's actions and accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , of inciting anti-semitism .
the leaflet cost € 8 million -lrb- $ 7.95 million -rrb- and was distributed to most households in north rhine-westphalia before the german general election days before the sept .

party leaders have blamed the fdp 's bad showing in the election , in which it only garnered 7.4 percent of the vote , on the bad press surrounding the leaflet . federal probe prosecutors opened a probe into möllemann 's affairs in november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.12.2002 eu list ' names and shames ' dangerous ships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as clean up efforts in spain continue , the eu attempts to ensure safety in european waters after a weekend of protests in spain concerning the prestige oil tanker disaster , the european commission releases a blacklist of 66 potentially dangerous ships . more than 200,000 people gathered in spain 's galicia region over the weekend to protest the spanish government 's handling of the prestige tanker disaster .
as oil continued to drift towards the coastline , angry locals braved driving rain to get the message out that the government had done too little , too late , in the wake of the tanker 's messy demise .
the people of the province have spent the past two weeks fighting against an initial 6,000-ton slick that came ashore after the prestige , an aging single-hulled tanker registered in liberia and flagged to the bahamas , was holed in storms .
around 5,500 tons have already been pumped from the sea by vessels from belgium , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seabird victim of the oil spill .
the slick has fouled more than 100 beaches to date and forced a fishing ban along 400 kilometers of coastline , crippling the local economy .
an estimated 15,000 seabirds have also been killed or covered in oil since the prestige broke apart .
submarine reveals no immediate threat of further spills then , on sunday , the first patches of oil from the second major slick arrived .
with fears growing that the sunken tanker may spill its remaining load , a french mini-submarine was sent down to the wreck .
the crew found no sign that the estimated 60,000 tons still on board the prestige were leaking - boosting hopes that the fuel had congealed in the freezing ocean depths .
as the cleanup operation along the spanish coast continues in earnest , the european commission on tuesday released a blacklist of 66 ships that it considers to be too dangerous for european waters .
oil and chemical tankers amongst 66 shamed ships the ships , mostly oil and chemical bulk carriers , have been " named and shamed " in an attempt to avoid the further exploitation of lax standards that led to the decrepit prestige entering european waters in such an unsafe condition .
the commission also wants all single-hulled tankers , like the prestige , banned from transporting fuel oil through european waters .
the plans will be discussed by european transport ministers at a summit in copenhagen next week .
blacklisted vessels all have previous warnings on record the dangerous vessels include 26 sailing under the turkish flag while 12 are flagged to st vincent and grenadines in the caribbean and nine to cambodia .
a total of 13 flags are represented .

bbc news online is touring eastern europe to find out if its economies are up to speed .
on the face of it , poland 's beskidy maly mountains , tucked between krakow and the slovak border , scarcely look like a threat to european stability . "
if the government introduced a more realistic definition of what a farmer actually is , the country 's agricultural sector would not seem half so inefficient " czeslaw nowak , agricultural university of krakow at irena and ryszard fraszczak 's tiny farm , on a misty peak high above the town of andrychow , the peace is disturbed only by the clucking of chickens .
the fraszczaks do n't produce a great deal from their dozen organic acres - a few potatoes , some fruit , the odd litre of milk - but they eke out their income with a stream of paying guests , who come from all over europe and beyond to sample rural life at its simplest .
but brussels is not beguiled by such bucolic bliss .
as eu enlargement looms , officials are increasingly concerned about how to accommodate the fraszczaks and millions of other small east european farmers in the continent 's agricultural machine .
small , not beautiful the problem with poland - and , to a somewhat lesser extent , with its east european neighbours - is that its farming sector bears little resemblance to what the west is used to .
in the plains of central poland , a few grain barons have emerged , but most polish farming remains at an uneconomically paltry scale .
some 1.6 million of poland 's 2.5 million registered farmers work on less than 20 acres , a plot of land seen as barely viable for a west european farmer .
the result of this is feeble productivity : although farming employs almost one in three poles , it accounts for less than 5 % of national economic output .
money worries for years now , brussels bureaucrats have been aware that this sort of thing could never be shoehorned into the common agricultural policy , which showers subsidies on farmers in poorer regions .
the cap already accounts for about one-third of brussels ' entire budget ; since almost all east european countries would qualify , the extra demand for subsidy would bankrupt the eu .
so far , eu member states have agreed a compromise deal , under which new members will be allowed a small but growing proportion of total farm payments , rising only to parity with the west when the cap is finally abolished in 2013 .
this compromise , predictably , has pleased few , east or west ; in poland , farmers fume at being forced onto an uneven playing field for far longer than anyone ever anticipated .
fake farmers the trickier question , however , is how much and what sort of help east european farmers will need to make them profitable in the long run .
czeslaw nowak , a professor at the agricultural university of krakow , argues that a certain measure of cruelty is inevitable if the sector is to be revived .
for years , he says , successive polish governments have turned a blind eye to hidden unemployment in the agricultural sector .
" the figures say that 28 % of poles are farmers , but in fact , less than half of them ever produce anything for the market . "
some 50 % of polish farmers produce only for themselves and their families , and 3 % produce nothing at all , dr nowak says .
" it makes no more sense to call these people farmers than to call them restaurant owners because they make the occasional cup of tea . "
brutal honesty the ranks of poland 's fake farmers are swelled by tax law .
registered farmers pay extremely low tax and social-security contributions , a perk that persuades many town-dwellers to buy or rent small plots of rural land to qualify .
" if the government introduced a more realistic definition of what a farmer actually is , the country 's agricultural sector would not seem half so inefficient , " says dr nowak .
" but politicians wo n't admit it , because then official unemployment would rise by a million or more . "
poland already has some 3.2 million people out of work , one of the highest levels among the eu candidate countries .
trade , not aid dr nowak hopes that the government will not simply channel subsidies to polish farmers .
the key , he argues , is creating employment opportunities in rural areas , something that might stem the relentless draining away of rural youth to the big cities .
eu structural funds - money earmarked for infrastructure projects in poorer countries - should be poured into improving rural poland 's ropey roads and almost non-existent telecoms network .
on the andrychow mountain , meanwhile , the fraszczaks are not exactly panting for government hand-outs .
" we do n't ask anything from the government , " says irena .
" we let them do their business , and hope they leave us alone to do ours . "

brutal honesty the ranks of poland 's fake farmers are swelled by tax law .
registered farmers pay extremely low tax and social-security contributions , a perk that persuades many town-dwellers to buy or rent small plots of rural land to qualify .
" if the government introduced a more realistic definition of what a farmer actually is , the country 's agricultural sector would not seem half so inefficient , " says dr nowak .
" but politicians wo n't admit it , because then official unemployment would rise by a million or more . "
poland already has some 3.2 million people out of work , one of the highest levels among the eu candidate countries .
trade , not aid dr nowak hopes that the government will not simply channel subsidies to polish farmers .
mrs fraszczak is happy as she is , thank you the key , he argues , is creating employment opportunities in rural areas , something that might stem the relentless draining away of rural youth to the big cities .
eu structural funds - money earmarked for infrastructure projects in poorer countries - should be poured into improving rural poland 's ropey roads and almost non-existent telecoms network .
on the andrychow mountain , meanwhile , the fraszczaks are not exactly panting for government hand-outs .
" we do n't ask anything from the government , " says irena .
" we let them do their business , and hope they leave us alone to do ours . "

public sector pay and pensions are the hot topics of the moment .
public sector unions claim that their members ' pay needs to be increased sharply to match private sector salaries .
as a result , pay disputes are rumbling throughout the public sector - london-based teachers and local government workers have recently taken industrial action .
without it many public sector workers would retire to poverty relying on the taxpayer .
glynn jenkins , head of pensions , unison and , of course , there are the firefighters .
but pay is only part of an employment package , as the recent spate of final salary closures have illustrated .
while workers in the commercial sector earn better salaries than public sector workers , the replacement of final salary company schemes with often inferior money purchase schemes has had a big impact on their overall pay and benefits package .
it has gone so far , according to bbc news online research , that the traditional gap between public and private sector pay and benefits have been reversed for the first time .
in fact , a typical public sector worker is now £ 203 a year better off , because private sector pensions have been cut from 20 % of salary to 12 % .
and new company recruits - those most likely to be shunted into money purchase schemes - face the biggest pension losses .
but these cuts have not been mirrored in the public sector .
growing gulf since june , final salary pension schemes have been closing at twice the rate of last year .
just under half of all final salary schemes run by private sector employers surveyed by the association of consulting actuaries are now closed to new entrants .
final salary schemes , which guarantee a pension income equivalent to a fixed proportion of the employee 's final salary , are usually more generous than money purchase schemes , which are affected by falling stock markets .
reversal of fortune according to the 2001 national association of pension funds -lrb- napf -rrb- survey , final salary schemes pay approximately 19 % of salary in the public sector , and 20 % in the private .
employers have not only been closing final salary schemes , but have also been cutting their contributions .
this means the combined employer and employee contribution to schemes has fallen to 12 % of salary .
the reduction in contributions has moved public servants into pole position overall .
it is possible that long term the scenario currently playing out in the private sector could move to the public sector , david astley napf director of benefits public sector employees earn on average £ 23,271 a year , just below the £ 24,544 that private sector workers are paid , according to the 2002 office of national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- earnings survey .
but factor in an averagely-funded public sector final salary scheme rather than an averagely-funded private sector money purchase pension , and the income table turns .
public sector workers edge into the lead by £ 203 a year .
' gold watch ' in truth , many private sector employees could be forgiven for licking their lips when looking at schemes available to public sector workers .
police employers , for example , pay 21 % of salary into the forces pension scheme - allowing many officers to take early retirement .
as for firefighters , their pension scheme allows retirement at 50 - a full 15 years before most workers get to collect their gold watch - and pays a 60th of average salary for each year of service .
mps have the best public sector pensions of the lot - with even humble backbenchers building up a pension of one 40th of salary for each year sat in the house .
king 's ransom however , for certain public servants the prospect of a final salary pension will be a small comfort for low wages .
glynn jenkins , head of pensions at public sector trade union unison , says government employees ' pension arrangements alleviate some of the burden on the public purse .
" without it , many public sector workers would retire to poverty relying on the taxpayer . "
even with final salary schemes , mr jenkins added , the average local government worker retires on a pension of only £ 3,800 a year .
but public sector schemes offer greater security , says david astley , the napf 's director of benefits .
mr astley told bbc news online : " ultimately , they are backed by the tax payer , whereas if a firm operating a final salary scheme goes to the wall then , as we have seen recently , some scheme members can lose a significant part of their benefit . "
achilles heel but public sector workers ' new status may not last long .
they may find that their pensions go the same way , as their private sector counterparts ' .
the public sector pensions ' ultimate reliance on the taxpayer could prove to be their achilles ' heel .
pension may be future battleground already , many public pension schemes are creaking under the pressures of the weak stock market and high levels of early retirement .
and if it comes to a choice between raising taxes to support public pensions , or changing the way they operate , mr astley believes public employees could lose out .
" it is possible that in the long term , the scenario currently playing out in the private sector could move to the public sector , " mr astley said .
and with the office of the deputy prime minister john prescott now looking at the future of public sector pensions , workers may in future be taking to the picket lines not for higher pay , but to protect their pension advantage .
your comments i work in the health sector .
i 'd like to meet some of these " average earners " on £ 23,000 .
i earn less than £ 14,000 , and there are certainly managers and lecturers on less than £ 23,000 .
we are expected to work evenings and weekends as standard -lrb- not overtime -rrb- .
getting it easy ?
do n't think so .
graham gamblin , uk a fireman retiring aged 50 with 30 years service would receive an index linked pension of approx £ 11,000 pa with a capital value of about £ 300,000 .
with the mooted increase of 16 % , this would rise to nearly £ 350,000 .
other than some directors ' schemes , this generosity is unmatched in the private sector .
paul phillips , england so there we are , in the not-too-distant future , public sector workers will not only get low pay but low pensions too .
the country apparently wants first-class public services. but what 's the old adage about what happens if you pay peanuts ? pip , uk i 've been in the public sector for the last 35 years and all that time suffered low wages while people in comparable jobs have had company cars , private health schemes and annual bonuses .
my work has been socially beneficial and i 've tolerated the pay gap because i 've enjoyed my work and also because i 've enjoyed working for the benefit of society .
i retire in a few years time on 50 % of my still too low salary .
lets not make too much of this issue - over the years people in comparable jobs outside have huge houses , large company cars and have had continual expensive foreign holiday .
so , the good life is n't so good for them when they retire ?
well its swings and roundabouts as far as i 'm concerned and yet i still doubt my allegedly generous pension will make up for the years and years of low pay preceding it .
tom cunliffe , uk nobody ever seems to mention civil servants when public sector pay is on the agenda .
we are poorly paid and our pension scheme has already been downgraded - new entrants are now asked to pay twice as much for virtually no extra benefits .
ben , uk as a public service worker i am getting my pension after 25 years service .
i retired early -lrb- 56 -rrb- after a heart attack .
i chose this job partly because of the pension and the reliability of employment .
in the private sector , many employees retire with no pension after shifting from job to job .
many employers loose their staff after nearly two years to avoid putting them on a pension and most private employment is unreliable because of bankruptcy or employers selling up .
i think that for the private sector an independent portable pension is the best choice .
how many private sector employees have regular work with one employer for 30 years and get a full pension ?
not many .
many public employees are also not in the public sector for 25 years and most people do not get the full pension .
chris , uk public sector employees already enjoy unprecedented job security not afforded to private sector employees .
if the company goes bust , i am out of a job .
what is even worse is that government -lrb- public sector -rrb- incompetence is one of the root causes for many private companies going bankrupt in the first place .
we have far to many public sector workers in europe , in particular the jobs worth buerocrats who contribute nothing to society .
garry s , germany how do your " average public " and " average private " change if you take out the top and bottom 10 % -so you have an average " normal wage " in both cases ?
i tend to think that inequalities are greater in the public sector , as surprising as it may sound .
felipe , uk having contributed to both , no i do n't think public sector workers have it easy .
i 'm ex-raf and when you listen to the press , you would think that we get our pension for nothing , whereas the truth is that the armed forces pay review body always took the value of our pension in to account and adjusts accordingly -lrb- always downwards -rrb- .
if the government scraps these pensions , it will mean that they have conned people in to taking lower pay over the years .
it ¿ s just a pity that our beloved government can not be investigated by the fsa .
chris , uk when compared to what ford are doing for their workforce , i do n't think anyone else in the country is getting a fair deal , particularly the public sector .
changes have been made to the pensions there including resulting in the employee having to pay more for less .
i think it would be interesting to find out how many employees in the public sector are entitled to wftc due to their low wages ?
ann , uk the main " benefit " of working in the public sector tends to be the relatively tolerant approach of employers to things like sickness or maternity leave .
job security and decent pensions are a compensation for relatively low pay , lack of bonuses , etc .
however , not all public sector workers get these benefits- many are on short-term contracts , and many job vacancies are left unfilled for long periods of time , leaving others to pick up the slack .
overall , the public sector is a good place to work in scotland , but probably less so in an expensive city like london .
steve , scotland my employer gives me a paltry 5 % contribution to a money-purchase pension and an " average " salary .
i think it 's a disgrace .
our managers , who are on almost double " average " salary get a 10 % pension .
to me this seems preposterously iniquitous .
government should legislate for a 10 % minimum employers contribution across the board and no way out .
that would level the field a bit .
rob moore , uk workers in the private sector are trebly disadvantaged compared with public sector workers .
first , in the private sector we have one absolute measure ¿ profits .
if profits are not made , or even not the appropriate level of profits ; jobs are lost .
second , private sectors tax and their company tax pay the public sector ; who seem to view this as a bottomless pit .
third , there is no job security in the private sector , unlike the public .
when market disciplines are introduced to the public sector they scream about wage cuts and requirements for higher productivity .
the private sector has been facing these demands for years .
finally , can someone explain why , when the government is saying that it can not afford public service pay demands mps get such high salaries , allowances and benefits ; including incredibly expensive pensions ; and a lot of them have second jobs .
the government points out that there are many applicants for each fire-fighters jobs there are even more applicants for mps jobs .
again , all paid for our of private sector taxes .
ian davidson , uk why should those in the private sector , who have seen the value of our pensions fall substantially in value , provide guaranteed final salary schemes for the public sector .
it is just another example of the government milking us for taxes and offering nothing in return .
jon , uk nice for the mp 's- but it all sounds a bit like propaganda- not many people spend 40 years in the same job these days- not even public sector workers .
also with the recent history of pension fraud / mismanagement will the funds really be there in 20 years time let alone 40 ? al , uk when comparing the average pay of workers in the public and private sectors , are we looking at the same work ?
many lower-paid jobs that used to be in the public sector are now privatised , so a simple comparison of average pay is potentially misleading .
ian , uk i am disgusted at the way the media are whipping up enthusiasm for cutting public sector pensions .
examples often used are police and fire brigades , the pensions based on 60ths and retirement after a max of 30 yrs of service or at age 50 .
local government workers pensions certainly in scotland are based on 80ths of salary , with a retirement age of 60 .
much is made of employers contributions now , but nothing is said about the holidays employers took in the 80 's , paying in nothing whilst the employees have consistently paid in their 6 % .
i would count any attempt to alter my pension rights as a breach of contract . , anon at last its been mentioned the fact is if you look at the total packages between public and private sector it is the public sector that is better off and this has been the case for years ! !
the whole package includes holidays , hours worked , overtime rates -lrb- quite often not paid in private sector at all -rrb- likelihood of redundancy , pensions and actual retirement age .
if it is so good in the private sector then why do public sector unions resist private sector terms and conditions they cant argue it both ways ! ! ! ! !
martyn , uk i work in the pensions industry and it is a well known fact that if you want good pension provision you should either be a company director or work in the public sector .
many private sector employees , myself included , receive no pension scheme benefits from my employer .
the sooner this changes the better .
gordon sinclair , england the time 's come for mps to be exposed to the same market risks as everyone else .
members of parliament enjoy too many ' perks of office ' at the tax payers expense .
i 'm not saying that office should n't carry some perks , just that a more palatable balance should be found , they should be exposed to the same risks as the public that employs them .
roger , uk how ironic that pension losers in the private sector are , through taxation , funding a comparative pensions extravaganza in the public sector .
as an ex-civil servant , and with friends who work for leeds council , i am only too aware of the profligate inefficiencies inherent in the public sector .
roll on the day when public services in this country are managed with the same rigour as the city expects of a footsie company .
william bell , leeds , uk terrible .
the country is being destroyed by an government devoid of any responsibility to the higher tax payers .
patrick mewton , london recent troubles have exposed the folly of gambling peoples long term financial security on the vagaries of the financial markets .
a more stable system is required , and i fear that this will cost more for employees and employers alike .
to those who squawk on about " i do n't see why i should subsidise . "
i say : empty your own bins , catch your own burglars , put out your own fires and educate your own kids for a month , then tell me what is worth " subsidising " .
take out your anger on your greedy employers rather than on public servants .
they are your servants and not your slaves , so show them some respect .
rodger edwards , uk i used to work for a large petrochemical company i enjoyed a non-contributory pension scheme based on 1/60 this and staff retired at 55 .
i now work in the public sector with a contributory 1/80th scheme and retirement at 65 .
featherbedded in the public sector ?
what do you think ?
kevin thompson , england the civil servants also benefit from job security not offered to anyone else .
i have twice worked within the service -lrb- the second time as a contractor -rrb- and i could see the relaxed , unpressured , stress free atmosphere that they work in .
we all choose where we work and all factors -lrb- pay , pension , stress and security -rrb- form part of the choice .
nigel , uk while many people still think that public sector workers seem to be hard done by , there are many millions of private sector workers on very low pay also .
we are not all highly paid corporate executives and also run the risk of increased job insecurity and , certainly , in the vast majority of small companies , no pension .
i wish public sector workers would stop whining and be thankful for what they have .

public sector pay and pensions are the hot topics of the moment .
public sector unions claim that their members ' pay needs to be increased sharply to match private sector salaries .
as a result , pay disputes are rumbling throughout the public sector - london-based teachers and local government workers have recently taken industrial action . "
without it many public sector workers would retire to poverty relying on the taxpayer . "
glynn jenkins , head of pensions , unison and , of course , there are the firefighters .
but pay is only part of an employment package , as the recent spate of final salary closures have illustrated .
while workers in the commercial sector earn better salaries than public sector workers , the replacement of final salary company schemes with often inferior money purchase schemes has had a big impact on their overall pay and benefits package .
it has gone so far , according to bbc news online research , that the traditional gap between public and private sector pay and benefits have been reversed for the first time .
in fact , a typical public sector worker is now £ 203 a year better off , because private sector pensions have been cut from 20 % of salary to 12 % .
and new company recruits - those most likely to be shunted into money purchase schemes - face the biggest pension losses .
but these cuts have not been mirrored in the public sector .
growing gulf since june , final salary pension schemes have been closing at twice the rate of last year .
just under half of all final salary schemes run by private sector employers surveyed by the association of consulting actuaries are now closed to new entrants .
final salary schemes , which guarantee a pension income equivalent to a fixed proportion of the employee 's final salary , are usually more generous than money purchase schemes , which are affected by falling stock markets .
reversal of fortune according to the 2001 national association of pension funds -lrb- napf -rrb- survey , final salary schemes pay approximately 19 % of salary in the public sector , and 20 % in the private .
employers have not only been closing final salary schemes , but have also been cutting their contributions .
this means the combined employer and employee contribution to schemes has fallen to 12 % of salary .
the reduction in contributions has moved public servants into pole position overall . "
it is possible that long term the scenario currently playing out in the private sector could move to the public sector , " david astley napf director of benefits public sector employees earn on average £ 23,271 a year , just below the £ 24,544 that private sector workers are paid , according to the 2002 office of national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- earnings survey .
but factor in an averagely-funded public sector final salary scheme rather than an averagely-funded private sector money purchase pension , and the income table turns .
public sector workers edge into the lead by £ 203 a year .
' gold watch ' in truth , many private sector employees could be forgiven for licking their lips when looking at schemes available to public sector workers .
police employers , for example , pay 21 % of salary into the forces pension scheme - allowing many officers to take early retirement .
as for firefighters , their pension scheme allows retirement at 50 - a full 15 years before most workers get to collect their gold watch - and pays a 60th of average salary for each year of service .
mps have the best public sector pensions of the lot - with even humble backbenchers building up a pension of one 40th of salary for each year sat in the house .
king 's ransom however , for certain public servants the prospect of a final salary pension will be a small comfort for low wages .
glynn jenkins , head of pensions at public sector trade union unison , says government employees ' pension arrangements alleviate some of the burden on the public purse .
" without it , many public sector workers would retire to poverty relying on the taxpayer . "
even with final salary schemes , mr jenkins added , the average local government worker retires on a pension of only £ 3,800 a year .
but public sector schemes offer greater security , says david astley , the napf 's director of benefits .
mr astley told bbc news online : " ultimately , they are backed by the tax payer , whereas if a firm operating a final salary scheme goes to the wall then , as we have seen recently , some scheme members can lose a significant part of their benefit . "
achilles heel but public sector workers ' new status may not last long .
they may find that their pensions go the same way , as their private sector counterparts ' .
the public sector pensions ' ultimate reliance on the taxpayer could prove to be their achilles ' heel .
already , many public pension schemes are creaking under the pressures of the weak stock market and high levels of early retirement .
and if it comes to a choice between raising taxes to support public pensions , or changing the way they operate , mr astley believes public employees could lose out .
" it is possible that in the long term , the scenario currently playing out in the private sector could move to the public sector , " mr astley said .
and with the office of the deputy prime minister john prescott now looking at the future of public sector pensions , workers may in future be taking to the picket lines not for higher pay , but to protect their pension advantage .
your comments i work in the health sector .
i 'd like to meet some of these " average earners " on £ 23,000 .
i earn less than £ 14,000 , and there are certainly managers and lecturers on less than £ 23,000 .
we are expected to work evenings and weekends as standard -lrb- not overtime -rrb- .
getting it easy ?
do n't think so .
graham gamblin , uk a fireman retiring aged 50 with 30 years service would receive an index linked pension of approx £ 11,000 pa with a capital value of about £ 300,000 .
with the mooted increase of 16 % , this would rise to nearly £ 350,000 .
other than some directors ' schemes , this generosity is unmatched in the private sector .
paul phillips , england so there we are , in the not-too-distant future , public sector workers will not only get low pay but low pensions too .
the country apparently wants first-class public services. but what 's the old adage about what happens if you pay peanuts ? pip , uk i 've been in the public sector for the last 35 years and all that time suffered low wages while people in comparable jobs have had company cars , private health schemes and annual bonuses .
my work has been socially beneficial and i 've tolerated the pay gap because i 've enjoyed my work and also because i 've enjoyed working for the benefit of society .
i retire in a few years time on 50 % of my still too low salary .
lets not make too much of this issue - over the years people in comparable jobs outside have huge houses , large company cars and have had continual expensive foreign holiday .
so , the good life is n't so good for them when they retire ?
well its swings and roundabouts as far as i 'm concerned and yet i still doubt my allegedly generous pension will make up for the years and years of low pay preceding it .
tom cunliffe , uk nobody ever seems to mention civil servants when public sector pay is on the agenda .
we are poorly paid and our pension scheme has already been downgraded - new entrants are now asked to pay twice as much for virtually no extra benefits .
ben , uk as a public service worker i am getting my pension after 25 years service .
i retired early -lrb- 56 -rrb- after a heart attack .
i chose this job partly because of the pension and the reliability of employment .
in the private sector , many employees retire with no pension after shifting from job to job .
many employers loose their staff after nearly two years to avoid putting them on a pension and most private employment is unreliable because of bankruptcy or employers selling up .
i think that for the private sector an independent portable pension is the best choice .
how many private sector employees have regular work with one employer for 30 years and get a full pension ?
not many .
many public employees are also not in the public sector for 25 years and most people do not get the full pension .
chris , uk public sector employees already enjoy unprecedented job security not afforded to private sector employees .
if the company goes bust , i am out of a job .
what is even worse is that government -lrb- public sector -rrb- incompetence is one of the root causes for many private companies going bankrupt in the first place .
we have far to many public sector workers in europe , in particular the jobs worth buerocrats who contribute nothing to society .
garry s , germany how do your " average public " and " average private " change if you take out the top and bottom 10 % -so you have an average " normal wage " in both cases ?
i tend to think that inequalities are greater in the public sector , as surprising as it may sound .
felipe , uk having contributed to both , no i do n't think public sector workers have it easy .
i 'm ex-raf and when you listen to the press , you would think that we get our pension for nothing , whereas the truth is that the armed forces pay review body always took the value of our pension in to account and adjusts accordingly -lrb- always downwards -rrb- .
if the government scraps these pensions , it will mean that they have conned people in to taking lower pay over the years .
it ¿ s just a pity that our beloved government can not be investigated by the fsa .
chris , uk when compared to what ford are doing for their workforce , i do n't think anyone else in the country is getting a fair deal , particularly the public sector .
changes have been made to the pensions there including resulting in the employee having to pay more for less .
i think it would be interesting to find out how many employees in the public sector are entitled to wftc due to their low wages ?
ann , uk the main " benefit " of working in the public sector tends to be the relatively tolerant approach of employers to things like sickness or maternity leave .
job security and decent pensions are a compensation for relatively low pay , lack of bonuses , etc .
however , not all public sector workers get these benefits- many are on short-term contracts , and many job vacancies are left unfilled for long periods of time , leaving others to pick up the slack .
overall , the public sector is a good place to work in scotland , but probably less so in an expensive city like london .
steve , scotland my employer gives me a paltry 5 % contribution to a money-purchase pension and an " average " salary .
i think it 's a disgrace .
our managers , who are on almost double " average " salary get a 10 % pension .
to me this seems preposterously iniquitous .
government should legislate for a 10 % minimum employers contribution across the board and no way out .
that would level the field a bit .
rob moore , uk workers in the private sector are trebly disadvantaged compared with public sector workers .
first , in the private sector we have one absolute measure ¿ profits .
if profits are not made , or even not the appropriate level of profits ; jobs are lost .
second , private sectors tax and their company tax pay the public sector ; who seem to view this as a bottomless pit .
third , there is no job security in the private sector , unlike the public .
when market disciplines are introduced to the public sector they scream about wage cuts and requirements for higher productivity .
the private sector has been facing these demands for years .
finally , can someone explain why , when the government is saying that it can not afford public service pay demands mps get such high salaries , allowances and benefits ; including incredibly expensive pensions ; and a lot of them have second jobs .
the government points out that there are many applicants for each fire-fighters jobs there are even more applicants for mps jobs .
again , all paid for our of private sector taxes .
ian davidson , uk why should those in the private sector , who have seen the value of our pensions fall substantially in value , provide guaranteed final salary schemes for the public sector .
it is just another example of the government milking us for taxes and offering nothing in return .
jon , uk nice for the mp 's- but it all sounds a bit like propaganda- not many people spend 40 years in the same job these days- not even public sector workers .

the new wales screen commission , fresh from a fact-finding mission to india , is confident of winning over more big-name directors looking for suitable locations .

he said he met with bollywood 's most senior producer , yash chopra , in bombay , before travelling to madras to meet bosses of the burgeoning film industry in south east india . "
whilst bollywood 's economic impact is limited , welcoming it to wales is all part of our mission to make wales a film friendly nation . "
mike wallwork , wales screen commission " locations are high on the agenda , " he said .

the new commission was set up to promote wales as a production base .
