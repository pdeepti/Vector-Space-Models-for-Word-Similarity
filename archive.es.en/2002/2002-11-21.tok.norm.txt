a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others . " like parma ham " the catholic and protestant churches started an anti-body worlds campaign when the show came to berlin in february 2001 .
the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "
pulsfort held a catholic requiem for the dead people displayed in the berlin exhibition . in germany and britain people have taken legal action against " body worlds , " claiming that the exhibition disturbs the dead and abuses corpses for artistic aims .
none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .
in march 2001 , a german tv current affairs program alleged that one of the bodies had a tattoo showing it came from a russian prison camp . half a year earlier von hagens had indeed contracted the anatomical institute of the university of novosibirsk to deliver around 150 brains and some 50 bodies to him in heidelberg .
von hagens insisted that the bodies displayed in berlin had already been prepared before the siberian business deal came about and that the tattoo belonged to a german man who he had personally known .
nevertheless , von hagens cancelled the contract to avoid further bad publicity . " body worlds " remains popular , despite - or perhaps thanks to - the controversy surrounding it .
five people a day signed disposition forms to donate their bodies to the heidelberg institute for plastination during the berlin exhibition , a german newspaper reported . whether or not von hagens is arrested for performing the autopsy , the publicity will surely translate to more visitors to " body worlds .

critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .
the germans have done their homework in tokyo well , but it ’ s actually rather symbolic , like germany wanting to take over the isaf -lrb- un international peacekeeping force in kabul -rrb- , " said bernt glatzer , chairman of the afghan research group , an informal association of scholars , writers , diplomats and aid and development workers who have worked or still work in or on afghanistan . " in terms of quantity , it isn ’ t very much . " glatzer , just back from afghanistan , says what ’ s missing when it comes to german aid to afghanistan is " a concept . "
" the projects need to make more sense , " he said .
as an example he cites the need to invest more in " providing drinking water , in the energy sector and in a market economy , to promote small businesses and to encourage vocational training programs . "
disarming the need of the day though he concedes that germany has done much to reopen shattered schools , glatzer says young men , rather than children , need serious attention .
money should go to programs that keep youths off the streets and into jobs , especially those in the ages between 16 and 26 , who are susceptible to take up arms for warlords to earn a living .
" though it ’ s not officially said , disarming of armed rebels is the most important priority .
all projects whether they ’ re in the civil area or vocational training should be set up keeping in mind the problem of weapons in the country , " he said .
afghanistan is skating on thin ice with president karsai caught between trying to placate his government members from various ethnic groups and an increasingly discontented population who don ’ t regard the government as a " legitimate " one .
the danger of guns and armed conflict lurking below the surface adds to the political tension in the country .
petersberg important for symbolic reasons though he doesn ’ t expect much from the upcoming petersberg conference , glatzer believes that the conference will be " useful " in keeping afghanistan in the public memory and allowing president karsai to demonstrate that his country has managed to survive a year without slipping back into civil war .

the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .
the germans have done their homework in tokyo well , but it ’ s actually rather symbolic , like germany wanting to take over the isaf -lrb- un international peacekeeping force in kabul -rrb- , " said bernt glatzer , chairman of the afghan research group , an informal association of scholars , writers , diplomats and aid and development workers who have worked or still work in or on afghanistan . " in terms of quantity , it isn ’ t very much . " glatzer , just back from afghanistan , says what ’ s missing when it comes to german aid to afghanistan is " a concept . "
" the projects need to make more sense , " he said .
as an example he cites the need to invest more in " providing drinking water , in the energy sector and in a market economy , to promote small businesses and to encourage vocational training programs . "
disarming the need of the day though he concedes that germany has done much to reopen shattered schools , glatzer says young men , rather than children , need serious attention .
money should go to programs that keep youths off the streets and into jobs , especially those in the ages between 16 and 26 , who are susceptible to take up arms for warlords to earn a living .
" though it ’ s not officially said , disarming of armed rebels is the most important priority .
all projects whether they ’ re in the civil area or vocational training should be set up keeping in mind the problem of weapons in the country , " he said .
afghanistan is skating on thin ice with president karsai caught between trying to placate his government members from various ethnic groups and an increasingly discontented population who don ’ t regard the government as a " legitimate " one .
the danger of guns and armed conflict lurking below the surface adds to the political tension in the country .
petersberg important for symbolic reasons though he doesn ’ t expect much from the upcoming petersberg conference , glatzer believes that the conference will be " useful " in keeping afghanistan in the public memory and allowing president karsai to demonstrate that his country has managed to survive a year without slipping back into civil war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.11.2002 rethinking german aid to afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german aid has given afghan children the chance to learn again a year after the historic afghanistan conference in bonn , germany will host a stock-taking meeting in december .
critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .

in an pre-released interview with the magazine " dmeuro , " friedman said eurozone members should eliminate the existing pact without replacing it with a new one .
the pact was possibly needed for political reasons to push the euro through , he said , " but now that we have the euro , i don ’ t believe that the stability pact offers any political or economic advantage . "
each european state should take care of its own finances , he added .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .
in a telephone conversation with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of denmark , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , bush also stressed " the importance of the copenhagen summit for advancing turkey 's evolution towards the eu . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new , expansive direction for nato ten eastern european countries are inching ever closer to becoming members of nato .
a meeting in latvia this weekend is the test run before expansion is approved in november .
-lrb- july 6 , 2002 -rrb- u.s.-german political frost starts to thaw with conciliatory gestures from the german chancellor and his defense minister and assurances from the u.s. that germany is one of its " closest friends , " tensions appear to be easing between berlin and washington .

industry revenues also sank by 5.5 percent compared to the previous month , with a turnover of 7.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.91 billion -rrb- .
the association of the german construction industry -lrb- hvbi -rrb- announced on wednesday that , although public construction has profited from a flurry of contracts after the recent flood catastrophe in eastern germany , housing and economic construction continues to be plagued by massive losses .
the industry has been in a deep crisis for years - mainly because the sector expanded too rapidly during the construction boom following german reunification in 1990 and later faced a market correction . more briefs 21.11.2002 -pipe- outlook bleak for germany 's skilled laborers 20.11.2002 -pipe- eu calls for cancellation of open skies agreements 20.11.2002 -pipe- mg technologies cut jobs after profits drop 20.11.2002 -pipe- german police launch investigation into fake teeth scandal 20.11.2002 -pipe- post offices close as employees protest cuts 19.11.2002 -pipe- deutsche post disputes penalty it must pay to german government 19.11.2002 -pipe- hair care company wella shows strong results 19.11.2002 -pipe- german labor market shrinks in 3rd quarter radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .
in a telephone conversation with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of denmark , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , bush also stressed " the importance of the copenhagen summit for advancing turkey 's evolution towards the eu . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new , expansive direction for nato ten eastern european countries are inching ever closer to becoming members of nato .

a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .
in a telephone conversation with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of denmark , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , bush also stressed " the importance of the copenhagen summit for advancing turkey 's evolution towards the eu . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new , expansive direction for nato ten eastern european countries are inching ever closer to becoming members of nato .

a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others . " like parma ham " the catholic and protestant churches started an anti-body worlds campaign when the show came to berlin in february 2001 .
the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "
pulsfort held a catholic requiem for the dead people displayed in the berlin exhibition . in germany and britain people have taken legal action against " body worlds , " claiming that the exhibition disturbs the dead and abuses corpses for artistic aims .
none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .
in march 2001 , a german tv current affairs program alleged that one of the bodies had a tattoo showing it came from a russian prison camp . half a year earlier von hagens had indeed contracted the anatomical institute of the university of novosibirsk to deliver around 150 brains and some 50 bodies to him in heidelberg .
von hagens insisted that the bodies displayed in berlin had already been prepared before the siberian business deal came about and that the tattoo belonged to a german man who he had personally known .
nevertheless , von hagens cancelled the contract to avoid further bad publicity . " body worlds " remains popular , despite - or perhaps thanks to - the controversy surrounding it .
five people a day signed disposition forms to donate their bodies to the heidelberg institute for plastination during the berlin exhibition , a german newspaper reported . whether or not von hagens is arrested for performing the autopsy , the publicity will surely translate to more visitors to " body worlds .

bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , slovenia , slovakia and rumania will join nato in 2004 .
the new nations follow the membership of poland , the czech republic and hungary in 1999 . “ by welcoming seven members , we will not only add to our military capabilities , we will refresh the spirti of this great democratic alliance , ” bush said in his opening speech . the comment touches on the main theme of this year ’ s summit .
burdened by criticism that its usefulness expired with the end of the cold war , nato is searching for ways in which to reinvent itself . more effective military the united states and great britain emphasize that the way to do that is by re-hauling its military structures and modernizing its equipment in order to better fight the terrorism . nato members agreed and on thursday approved a us-pushed plan to create a 20,000-strong european-led fighting force able to deploy anywhere in the world within a matter of days . the force would take some of the military burden off the united states and allow europe to solve problems , like the bosnian war in the early 1990s , more effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one european army too many ?

critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .
the germans have done their homework in tokyo well , but it ’ s actually rather symbolic , like germany wanting to take over the isaf -lrb- un international peacekeeping force in kabul -rrb- , " said bernt glatzer , chairman of the afghan research group , an informal association of scholars , writers , diplomats and aid and development workers who have worked or still work in or on afghanistan . " in terms of quantity , it isn ’ t very much . " glatzer , just back from afghanistan , says what ’ s missing when it comes to german aid to afghanistan is " a concept . "
" the projects need to make more sense , " he said .
as an example he cites the need to invest more in " providing drinking water , in the energy sector and in a market economy , to promote small businesses and to encourage vocational training programs . "
disarming the need of the day though he concedes that germany has done much to reopen shattered schools , glatzer says young men , rather than children , need serious attention .
money should go to programs that keep youths off the streets and into jobs , especially those in the ages between 16 and 26 , who are susceptible to take up arms for warlords to earn a living .
" though it ’ s not officially said , disarming of armed rebels is the most important priority .
all projects whether they ’ re in the civil area or vocational training should be set up keeping in mind the problem of weapons in the country , " he said .
afghanistan is skating on thin ice with president karsai caught between trying to placate his government members from various ethnic groups and an increasingly discontented population who don ’ t regard the government as a " legitimate " one .
the danger of guns and armed conflict lurking below the surface adds to the political tension in the country .
petersberg important for symbolic reasons though he doesn ’ t expect much from the upcoming petersberg conference , glatzer believes that the conference will be " useful " in keeping afghanistan in the public memory and allowing president karsai to demonstrate that his country has managed to survive a year without slipping back into civil war .
that would also justify karsai making another appeal for international aid . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german foreign ministry 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .
in a telephone conversation with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of denmark , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , bush also stressed " the importance of the copenhagen summit for advancing turkey 's evolution towards the eu .

critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .
the germans have done their homework in tokyo well , but it ’ s actually rather symbolic , like germany wanting to take over the isaf -lrb- un international peacekeeping force in kabul -rrb- , " said bernt glatzer , chairman of the afghan research group , an informal association of scholars , writers , diplomats and aid and development workers who have worked or still work in or on afghanistan . " in terms of quantity , it isn ’ t very much . " glatzer , just back from afghanistan , says what ’ s missing when it comes to german aid to afghanistan is " a concept . "
" the projects need to make more sense , " he said .
as an example he cites the need to invest more in " providing drinking water , in the energy sector and in a market economy , to promote small businesses and to encourage vocational training programs . "
disarming the need of the day though he concedes that germany has done much to reopen shattered schools , glatzer says young men , rather than children , need serious attention .
money should go to programs that keep youths off the streets and into jobs , especially those in the ages between 16 and 26 , who are susceptible to take up arms for warlords to earn a living .
" though it ’ s not officially said , disarming of armed rebels is the most important priority .
all projects whether they ’ re in the civil area or vocational training should be set up keeping in mind the problem of weapons in the country , " he said .
afghanistan is skating on thin ice with president karsai caught between trying to placate his government members from various ethnic groups and an increasingly discontented population who don ’ t regard the government as a " legitimate " one .
the danger of guns and armed conflict lurking below the surface adds to the political tension in the country .
petersberg important for symbolic reasons though he doesn ’ t expect much from the upcoming petersberg conference , glatzer believes that the conference will be " useful " in keeping afghanistan in the public memory and allowing president karsai to demonstrate that his country has managed to survive a year without slipping back into civil war .
that would also justify karsai making another appeal for international aid . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german foreign ministry 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others . " like parma ham " the catholic and protestant churches started an anti-body worlds campaign when the show came to berlin in february 2001 .
the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "
pulsfort held a catholic requiem for the dead people displayed in the berlin exhibition . in germany and britain people have taken legal action against " body worlds , " claiming that the exhibition disturbs the dead and abuses corpses for artistic aims .
none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .
in march 2001 , a german tv current affairs program alleged that one of the bodies had a tattoo showing it came from a russian prison camp . half a year earlier von hagens had indeed contracted the anatomical institute of the university of novosibirsk to deliver around 150 brains and some 50 bodies to him in heidelberg .
von hagens insisted that the bodies displayed in berlin had already been prepared before the siberian business deal came about and that the tattoo belonged to a german man who he had personally known .
nevertheless , von hagens cancelled the contract to avoid further bad publicity . " body worlds " remains popular , despite - or perhaps thanks to - the controversy surrounding it .
five people a day signed disposition forms to donate their bodies to the heidelberg institute for plastination during the berlin exhibition , a german newspaper reported . whether or not von hagens is arrested for performing the autopsy , the publicity will surely translate to more visitors to " body worlds .

he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .
“ just like that , ” he laughs and answers the call .
it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .
that goes for films about music as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmplakat " viel passiert - der bap film , wim wenders , film , regisseur music has been the topic of wenders ’ last three films .
the hugely successful cinematic tribute to the aging musicians of cuba ’ s buena vista social club was followed by a film about the somewhat younger music-makers of bap , a band from cologne -lrb- photo -rrb- .
that film , however , was a flop , drawing just 30,000 people to the theatres .
but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .
this wenders homage to two blues legends , skip james and j.p. lenoir , will be called “ devil got my woman ” and should be ready … at some point .
a family road farce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders headshot , german movie director the next project is already lined up .
this time wenders is taking a break from music and directing a feature film .
he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .
still , he doesn ’ t want to the leave the us again , like he did when ronald reagan was elected .
the “ petty nationalism ” that has reared its head since september 11th will pass , he says .
no mincing of words wim wenders doesn ’ t limit himself to the world of purely aesthetic concerns and isn ’ t one to shy away from politics , especially when decisions are made that he feels are wrong .
in the sphere for foreign affairs , for example , he wants to see europe come up with a clear position regarding israel .
domestically , he has spoken out for greater transparency in the german political party system .
time is precious for wim wenders , still , he likes to chat , about just about anything — about how painful it is that his soccer team fortuna düsseldorf is doing so badly , about how much he liked the film “ halbe treppe , ” about what kind of advice dennis hopper once gave him regarding interviews .
wim wenders is simply a good storyteller , in life as well as in celluloid . oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .
“ just like that , ” he laughs and answers the call .
it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .
that goes for films about music as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmplakat " viel passiert - der bap film , wim wenders , film , regisseur music has been the topic of wenders ’ last three films .
the hugely successful cinematic tribute to the aging musicians of cuba ’ s buena vista social club was followed by a film about the somewhat younger music-makers of bap , a band from cologne -lrb- photo -rrb- .
that film , however , was a flop , drawing just 30,000 people to the theatres .
but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .
this wenders homage to two blues legends , skip james and j.p. lenoir , will be called “ devil got my woman ” and should be ready … at some point .
a family road farce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders headshot , german movie director the next project is already lined up .
this time wenders is taking a break from music and directing a feature film .
he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .
still , he doesn ’ t want to the leave the us again , like he did when ronald reagan was elected .
the “ petty nationalism ” that has reared its head since september 11th will pass , he says .
no mincing of words wim wenders doesn ’ t limit himself to the world of purely aesthetic concerns and isn ’ t one to shy away from politics , especially when decisions are made that he feels are wrong .
in the sphere for foreign affairs , for example , he wants to see europe come up with a clear position regarding israel .
domestically , he has spoken out for greater transparency in the german political party system .
time is precious for wim wenders , still , he likes to chat , about just about anything — about how painful it is that his soccer team fortuna düsseldorf is doing so badly , about how much he liked the film “ halbe treppe , ” about what kind of advice dennis hopper once gave him regarding interviews .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .
in a telephone conversation with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of denmark , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , bush also stressed " the importance of the copenhagen summit for advancing turkey 's evolution towards the eu .

he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .
“ just like that , ” he laughs and answers the call .
it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .
that goes for films about music as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmplakat " viel passiert - der bap film , wim wenders , film , regisseur music has been the topic of wenders ’ last three films .
the hugely successful cinematic tribute to the aging musicians of cuba ’ s buena vista social club was followed by a film about the somewhat younger music-makers of bap , a band from cologne -lrb- photo -rrb- .
that film , however , was a flop , drawing just 30,000 people to the theatres .
but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .
this wenders homage to two blues legends , skip james and j.p. lenoir , will be called “ devil got my woman ” and should be ready … at some point .
a family road farce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders headshot , german movie director the next project is already lined up .
this time wenders is taking a break from music and directing a feature film .
he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .
still , he doesn ’ t want to the leave the us again , like he did when ronald reagan was elected .
the “ petty nationalism ” that has reared its head since september 11th will pass , he says .
no mincing of words wim wenders doesn ’ t limit himself to the world of purely aesthetic concerns and isn ’ t one to shy away from politics , especially when decisions are made that he feels are wrong .
in the sphere for foreign affairs , for example , he wants to see europe come up with a clear position regarding israel .
domestically , he has spoken out for greater transparency in the german political party system .
time is precious for wim wenders , still , he likes to chat , about just about anything — about how painful it is that his soccer team fortuna düsseldorf is doing so badly , about how much he liked the film “ halbe treppe , ” about what kind of advice dennis hopper once gave him regarding interviews .

a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others . " like parma ham " the catholic and protestant churches started an anti-body worlds campaign when the show came to berlin in february 2001 .
the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "
pulsfort held a catholic requiem for the dead people displayed in the berlin exhibition . in germany and britain people have taken legal action against " body worlds , " claiming that the exhibition disturbs the dead and abuses corpses for artistic aims .
none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .
in march 2001 , a german tv current affairs program alleged that one of the bodies had a tattoo showing it came from a russian prison camp . half a year earlier von hagens had indeed contracted the anatomical institute of the university of novosibirsk to deliver around 150 brains and some 50 bodies to him in heidelberg .
von hagens insisted that the bodies displayed in berlin had already been prepared before the siberian business deal came about and that the tattoo belonged to a german man who he had personally known .
nevertheless , von hagens cancelled the contract to avoid further bad publicity . " body worlds " remains popular , despite - or perhaps thanks to - the controversy surrounding it .
five people a day signed disposition forms to donate their bodies to the heidelberg institute for plastination during the berlin exhibition , a german newspaper reported . whether or not von hagens is arrested for performing the autopsy , the publicity will surely translate to more visitors to " body worlds .

critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .
the germans have done their homework in tokyo well , but it ’ s actually rather symbolic , like germany wanting to take over the isaf -lrb- un international peacekeeping force in kabul -rrb- , " said bernt glatzer , chairman of the afghan research group , an informal association of scholars , writers , diplomats and aid and development workers who have worked or still work in or on afghanistan . " in terms of quantity , it isn ’ t very much . " glatzer , just back from afghanistan , says what ’ s missing when it comes to german aid to afghanistan is " a concept . "
" the projects need to make more sense , " he said .
as an example he cites the need to invest more in " providing drinking water , in the energy sector and in a market economy , to promote small businesses and to encourage vocational training programs . "
disarming the need of the day though he concedes that germany has done much to reopen shattered schools , glatzer says young men , rather than children , need serious attention .
money should go to programs that keep youths off the streets and into jobs , especially those in the ages between 16 and 26 , who are susceptible to take up arms for warlords to earn a living .
" though it ’ s not officially said , disarming of armed rebels is the most important priority .
all projects whether they ’ re in the civil area or vocational training should be set up keeping in mind the problem of weapons in the country , " he said .
afghanistan is skating on thin ice with president karsai caught between trying to placate his government members from various ethnic groups and an increasingly discontented population who don ’ t regard the government as a " legitimate " one .
the danger of guns and armed conflict lurking below the surface adds to the political tension in the country .
petersberg important for symbolic reasons though he doesn ’ t expect much from the upcoming petersberg conference , glatzer believes that the conference will be " useful " in keeping afghanistan in the public memory and allowing president karsai to demonstrate that his country has managed to survive a year without slipping back into civil war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.11.2002 rethinking german aid to afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german aid has given afghan children the chance to learn again a year after the historic afghanistan conference in bonn , germany will host a stock-taking meeting in december .
critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .

a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others . " like parma ham " the catholic and protestant churches started an anti-body worlds campaign when the show came to berlin in february 2001 .
the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "
pulsfort held a catholic requiem for the dead people displayed in the berlin exhibition . in germany and britain people have taken legal action against " body worlds , " claiming that the exhibition disturbs the dead and abuses corpses for artistic aims .
none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .
in march 2001 , a german tv current affairs program alleged that one of the bodies had a tattoo showing it came from a russian prison camp . half a year earlier von hagens had indeed contracted the anatomical institute of the university of novosibirsk to deliver around 150 brains and some 50 bodies to him in heidelberg .
von hagens insisted that the bodies displayed in berlin had already been prepared before the siberian business deal came about and that the tattoo belonged to a german man who he had personally known .

he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .
“ just like that , ” he laughs and answers the call .
it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .
that goes for films about music as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmplakat " viel passiert - der bap film , wim wenders , film , regisseur music has been the topic of wenders ’ last three films .
the hugely successful cinematic tribute to the aging musicians of cuba ’ s buena vista social club was followed by a film about the somewhat younger music-makers of bap , a band from cologne -lrb- photo -rrb- .
that film , however , was a flop , drawing just 30,000 people to the theatres .
but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .
this wenders homage to two blues legends , skip james and j.p. lenoir , will be called “ devil got my woman ” and should be ready … at some point .
a family road farce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders headshot , german movie director the next project is already lined up .
this time wenders is taking a break from music and directing a feature film .
he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .
still , he doesn ’ t want to the leave the us again , like he did when ronald reagan was elected .
the “ petty nationalism ” that has reared its head since september 11th will pass , he says .
no mincing of words wim wenders doesn ’ t limit himself to the world of purely aesthetic concerns and isn ’ t one to shy away from politics , especially when decisions are made that he feels are wrong .
in the sphere for foreign affairs , for example , he wants to see europe come up with a clear position regarding israel .
domestically , he has spoken out for greater transparency in the german political party system .
time is precious for wim wenders , still , he likes to chat , about just about anything — about how painful it is that his soccer team fortuna düsseldorf is doing so badly , about how much he liked the film “ halbe treppe , ” about what kind of advice dennis hopper once gave him regarding interviews .

a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others . " like parma ham " the catholic and protestant churches started an anti-body worlds campaign when the show came to berlin in february 2001 .
the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "
pulsfort held a catholic requiem for the dead people displayed in the berlin exhibition . in germany and britain people have taken legal action against " body worlds , " claiming that the exhibition disturbs the dead and abuses corpses for artistic aims .
none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .
in march 2001 , a german tv current affairs program alleged that one of the bodies had a tattoo showing it came from a russian prison camp . half a year earlier von hagens had indeed contracted the anatomical institute of the university of novosibirsk to deliver around 150 brains and some 50 bodies to him in heidelberg .
von hagens insisted that the bodies displayed in berlin had already been prepared before the siberian business deal came about and that the tattoo belonged to a german man who he had personally known .
nevertheless , von hagens cancelled the contract to avoid further bad publicity . " body worlds " remains popular , despite - or perhaps thanks to - the controversy surrounding it .
five people a day signed disposition forms to donate their bodies to the heidelberg institute for plastination during the berlin exhibition , a german newspaper reported . whether or not von hagens is arrested for performing the autopsy , the publicity will surely translate to more visitors to " body worlds .

the exhibition is now being shown in london and seoul . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the exhibition ' body worlds ' 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .

8 deadline the resolution gives saddam hussein to inventory his weapons of mass destruction . us president george w. bush stopped short of asking nato nations to support a war with iraq during his speech at the opening of the summit in prague on thursday .
but officials told reporters yesterday that the white house has asked more than 50 countries , including germany , what it would be willing to do should the us and uk invade iraq . german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday repeated the german line that the country ’ s military would not participate in an invasion .
but the foreign minister and a chancellor spokesman did issue a joint statement saying the country would provide air space and the use of military bases in germany to the us and great britain . new nations will join in 2004 nato leaders showed more resolve in welcoming the seven new nations , all former communist eastern european nations , into the 53-year-old alliance .
bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , slovenia , slovakia and rumania will join nato in 2004 .
the new nations follow the membership of poland , the czech republic and hungary in 1999 . “ by welcoming seven members , we will not only add to our military capabilities , we will refresh the spirti of this great democratic alliance , ” bush said in his opening speech . the comment touches on the main theme of this year ’ s summit .
burdened by criticism that its usefulness expired with the end of the cold war , nato is searching for ways in which to reinvent itself . more effective military the united states and great britain emphasize that the way to do that is by re-hauling its military structures and modernizing its equipment in order to better fight the terrorism . nato members agreed and on thursday approved a us-pushed plan to create a 20,000-strong european-led fighting force able to deploy anywhere in the world within a matter of days . the force would take some of the military burden off the united states and allow europe to solve problems , like the bosnian war in the early 1990s , more effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one european army too many ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.11.2002 wim wenders : art in motion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this spring , wim wenders will stand behind the camera as he shoots his next film besides being a world-famous director , wim wenders is a photographer and professor .
he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .
“ just like that , ” he laughs and answers the call .
it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .
that goes for films about music as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmplakat " viel passiert - der bap film , wim wenders , film , regisseur music has been the topic of wenders ’ last three films .
the hugely successful cinematic tribute to the aging musicians of cuba ’ s buena vista social club was followed by a film about the somewhat younger music-makers of bap , a band from cologne -lrb- photo -rrb- .
that film , however , was a flop , drawing just 30,000 people to the theatres .
but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .
this wenders homage to two blues legends , skip james and j.p. lenoir , will be called “ devil got my woman ” and should be ready … at some point .
a family road farce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders headshot , german movie director the next project is already lined up .
this time wenders is taking a break from music and directing a feature film .
he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .
still , he doesn ’ t want to the leave the us again , like he did when ronald reagan was elected .
the “ petty nationalism ” that has reared its head since september 11th will pass , he says .
no mincing of words wim wenders doesn ’ t limit himself to the world of purely aesthetic concerns and isn ’ t one to shy away from politics , especially when decisions are made that he feels are wrong .
in the sphere for foreign affairs , for example , he wants to see europe come up with a clear position regarding israel .
domestically , he has spoken out for greater transparency in the german political party system .
time is precious for wim wenders , still , he likes to chat , about just about anything — about how painful it is that his soccer team fortuna düsseldorf is doing so badly , about how much he liked the film “ halbe treppe , ” about what kind of advice dennis hopper once gave him regarding interviews .
wim wenders is simply a good storyteller , in life as well as in celluloid . oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others .

the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "

none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .
in march 2001 , a german tv current affairs program alleged that one of the bodies had a tattoo showing it came from a russian prison camp . half a year earlier von hagens had indeed contracted the anatomical institute of the university of novosibirsk to deliver around 150 brains and some 50 bodies to him in heidelberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.11.2002 rethinking german aid to afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german aid has given afghan children the chance to learn again a year after the historic afghanistan conference in bonn , germany will host a stock-taking meeting in december .
critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .
the germans have done their homework in tokyo well , but it ’ s actually rather symbolic , like germany wanting to take over the isaf -lrb- un international peacekeeping force in kabul -rrb- , " said bernt glatzer , chairman of the afghan research group , an informal association of scholars , writers , diplomats and aid and development workers who have worked or still work in or on afghanistan . " in terms of quantity , it isn ’ t very much . " glatzer , just back from afghanistan , says what ’ s missing when it comes to german aid to afghanistan is " a concept . "
" the projects need to make more sense , " he said .
as an example he cites the need to invest more in " providing drinking water , in the energy sector and in a market economy , to promote small businesses and to encourage vocational training programs . "
disarming the need of the day though he concedes that germany has done much to reopen shattered schools , glatzer says young men , rather than children , need serious attention .
money should go to programs that keep youths off the streets and into jobs , especially those in the ages between 16 and 26 , who are susceptible to take up arms for warlords to earn a living .
" though it ’ s not officially said , disarming of armed rebels is the most important priority .
all projects whether they ’ re in the civil area or vocational training should be set up keeping in mind the problem of weapons in the country , " he said .
afghanistan is skating on thin ice with president karsai caught between trying to placate his government members from various ethnic groups and an increasingly discontented population who don ’ t regard the government as a " legitimate " one .
the danger of guns and armed conflict lurking below the surface adds to the political tension in the country .
petersberg important for symbolic reasons though he doesn ’ t expect much from the upcoming petersberg conference , glatzer believes that the conference will be " useful " in keeping afghanistan in the public memory and allowing president karsai to demonstrate that his country has managed to survive a year without slipping back into civil war .
that would also justify karsai making another appeal for international aid . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german foreign ministry 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .
the germans have done their homework in tokyo well , but it ’ s actually rather symbolic , like germany wanting to take over the isaf -lrb- un international peacekeeping force in kabul -rrb- , " said bernt glatzer , chairman of the afghan research group , an informal association of scholars , writers , diplomats and aid and development workers who have worked or still work in or on afghanistan . " in terms of quantity , it isn ’ t very much . " glatzer , just back from afghanistan , says what ’ s missing when it comes to german aid to afghanistan is " a concept . "
" the projects need to make more sense , " he said .
as an example he cites the need to invest more in " providing drinking water , in the energy sector and in a market economy , to promote small businesses and to encourage vocational training programs . "
disarming the need of the day though he concedes that germany has done much to reopen shattered schools , glatzer says young men , rather than children , need serious attention .
money should go to programs that keep youths off the streets and into jobs , especially those in the ages between 16 and 26 , who are susceptible to take up arms for warlords to earn a living .
" though it ’ s not officially said , disarming of armed rebels is the most important priority .
all projects whether they ’ re in the civil area or vocational training should be set up keeping in mind the problem of weapons in the country , " he said .
afghanistan is skating on thin ice with president karsai caught between trying to placate his government members from various ethnic groups and an increasingly discontented population who don ’ t regard the government as a " legitimate " one .
the danger of guns and armed conflict lurking below the surface adds to the political tension in the country .
petersberg important for symbolic reasons though he doesn ’ t expect much from the upcoming petersberg conference , glatzer believes that the conference will be " useful " in keeping afghanistan in the public memory and allowing president karsai to demonstrate that his country has managed to survive a year without slipping back into civil war .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .
in a telephone conversation with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of denmark , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , bush also stressed " the importance of the copenhagen summit for advancing turkey 's evolution towards the eu .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .
in a telephone conversation with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of denmark , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , bush also stressed " the importance of the copenhagen summit for advancing turkey 's evolution towards the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.11.2002 wim wenders : art in motion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this spring , wim wenders will stand behind the camera as he shoots his next film besides being a world-famous director , wim wenders is a photographer and professor .
he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .
“ just like that , ” he laughs and answers the call .
it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .
that goes for films about music as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmplakat " viel passiert - der bap film , wim wenders , film , regisseur music has been the topic of wenders ’ last three films .
the hugely successful cinematic tribute to the aging musicians of cuba ’ s buena vista social club was followed by a film about the somewhat younger music-makers of bap , a band from cologne -lrb- photo -rrb- .
that film , however , was a flop , drawing just 30,000 people to the theatres .
but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .
this wenders homage to two blues legends , skip james and j.p. lenoir , will be called “ devil got my woman ” and should be ready … at some point .
a family road farce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders headshot , german movie director the next project is already lined up .
this time wenders is taking a break from music and directing a feature film .
he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .
still , he doesn ’ t want to the leave the us again , like he did when ronald reagan was elected .
the “ petty nationalism ” that has reared its head since september 11th will pass , he says .
no mincing of words wim wenders doesn ’ t limit himself to the world of purely aesthetic concerns and isn ’ t one to shy away from politics , especially when decisions are made that he feels are wrong .
in the sphere for foreign affairs , for example , he wants to see europe come up with a clear position regarding israel .
domestically , he has spoken out for greater transparency in the german political party system .
time is precious for wim wenders , still , he likes to chat , about just about anything — about how painful it is that his soccer team fortuna düsseldorf is doing so badly , about how much he liked the film “ halbe treppe , ” about what kind of advice dennis hopper once gave him regarding interviews .
wim wenders is simply a good storyteller , in life as well as in celluloid . oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .
“ just like that , ” he laughs and answers the call .
it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .
that goes for films about music as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmplakat " viel passiert - der bap film , wim wenders , film , regisseur music has been the topic of wenders ’ last three films .
the hugely successful cinematic tribute to the aging musicians of cuba ’ s buena vista social club was followed by a film about the somewhat younger music-makers of bap , a band from cologne -lrb- photo -rrb- .
that film , however , was a flop , drawing just 30,000 people to the theatres .
but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .
this wenders homage to two blues legends , skip james and j.p. lenoir , will be called “ devil got my woman ” and should be ready … at some point .

this time wenders is taking a break from music and directing a feature film .
he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .
still , he doesn ’ t want to the leave the us again , like he did when ronald reagan was elected .
the “ petty nationalism ” that has reared its head since september 11th will pass , he says .
no mincing of words wim wenders doesn ’ t limit himself to the world of purely aesthetic concerns and isn ’ t one to shy away from politics , especially when decisions are made that he feels are wrong .
in the sphere for foreign affairs , for example , he wants to see europe come up with a clear position regarding israel .
domestically , he has spoken out for greater transparency in the german political party system .
time is precious for wim wenders , still , he likes to chat , about just about anything — about how painful it is that his soccer team fortuna düsseldorf is doing so badly , about how much he liked the film “ halbe treppe , ” about what kind of advice dennis hopper once gave him regarding interviews .

he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .

it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .

but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .

he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .
still , he doesn ’ t want to the leave the us again , like he did when ronald reagan was elected .

he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .
“ just like that , ” he laughs and answers the call .
it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .
that goes for films about music as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmplakat " viel passiert - der bap film , wim wenders , film , regisseur music has been the topic of wenders ’ last three films .
the hugely successful cinematic tribute to the aging musicians of cuba ’ s buena vista social club was followed by a film about the somewhat younger music-makers of bap , a band from cologne -lrb- photo -rrb- .
that film , however , was a flop , drawing just 30,000 people to the theatres .
but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .
this wenders homage to two blues legends , skip james and j.p. lenoir , will be called “ devil got my woman ” and should be ready … at some point .
a family road farce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders headshot , german movie director the next project is already lined up .
this time wenders is taking a break from music and directing a feature film .
he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .
still , he doesn ’ t want to the leave the us again , like he did when ronald reagan was elected .
the “ petty nationalism ” that has reared its head since september 11th will pass , he says .
no mincing of words wim wenders doesn ’ t limit himself to the world of purely aesthetic concerns and isn ’ t one to shy away from politics , especially when decisions are made that he feels are wrong .
in the sphere for foreign affairs , for example , he wants to see europe come up with a clear position regarding israel .
domestically , he has spoken out for greater transparency in the german political party system .
time is precious for wim wenders , still , he likes to chat , about just about anything — about how painful it is that his soccer team fortuna düsseldorf is doing so badly , about how much he liked the film “ halbe treppe , ” about what kind of advice dennis hopper once gave him regarding interviews .

a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others . " like parma ham " the catholic and protestant churches started an anti-body worlds campaign when the show came to berlin in february 2001 .
the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "
pulsfort held a catholic requiem for the dead people displayed in the berlin exhibition . in germany and britain people have taken legal action against " body worlds , " claiming that the exhibition disturbs the dead and abuses corpses for artistic aims .
none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .
in march 2001 , a german tv current affairs program alleged that one of the bodies had a tattoo showing it came from a russian prison camp . half a year earlier von hagens had indeed contracted the anatomical institute of the university of novosibirsk to deliver around 150 brains and some 50 bodies to him in heidelberg .

a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others . " like parma ham " the catholic and protestant churches started an anti-body worlds campaign when the show came to berlin in february 2001 .
the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "
pulsfort held a catholic requiem for the dead people displayed in the berlin exhibition . in germany and britain people have taken legal action against " body worlds , " claiming that the exhibition disturbs the dead and abuses corpses for artistic aims .
none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .
in march 2001 , a german tv current affairs program alleged that one of the bodies had a tattoo showing it came from a russian prison camp . half a year earlier von hagens had indeed contracted the anatomical institute of the university of novosibirsk to deliver around 150 brains and some 50 bodies to him in heidelberg .
von hagens insisted that the bodies displayed in berlin had already been prepared before the siberian business deal came about and that the tattoo belonged to a german man who he had personally known .
nevertheless , von hagens cancelled the contract to avoid further bad publicity . " body worlds " remains popular , despite - or perhaps thanks to - the controversy surrounding it .
five people a day signed disposition forms to donate their bodies to the heidelberg institute for plastination during the berlin exhibition , a german newspaper reported . whether or not von hagens is arrested for performing the autopsy , the publicity will surely translate to more visitors to " body worlds .

critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .
the germans have done their homework in tokyo well , but it ’ s actually rather symbolic , like germany wanting to take over the isaf -lrb- un international peacekeeping force in kabul -rrb- , " said bernt glatzer , chairman of the afghan research group , an informal association of scholars , writers , diplomats and aid and development workers who have worked or still work in or on afghanistan . " in terms of quantity , it isn ’ t very much . " glatzer , just back from afghanistan , says what ’ s missing when it comes to german aid to afghanistan is " a concept . "
" the projects need to make more sense , " he said .
as an example he cites the need to invest more in " providing drinking water , in the energy sector and in a market economy , to promote small businesses and to encourage vocational training programs . "
disarming the need of the day though he concedes that germany has done much to reopen shattered schools , glatzer says young men , rather than children , need serious attention .
money should go to programs that keep youths off the streets and into jobs , especially those in the ages between 16 and 26 , who are susceptible to take up arms for warlords to earn a living .
" though it ’ s not officially said , disarming of armed rebels is the most important priority .
all projects whether they ’ re in the civil area or vocational training should be set up keeping in mind the problem of weapons in the country , " he said .
afghanistan is skating on thin ice with president karsai caught between trying to placate his government members from various ethnic groups and an increasingly discontented population who don ’ t regard the government as a " legitimate " one .
the danger of guns and armed conflict lurking below the surface adds to the political tension in the country .
petersberg important for symbolic reasons though he doesn ’ t expect much from the upcoming petersberg conference , glatzer believes that the conference will be " useful " in keeping afghanistan in the public memory and allowing president karsai to demonstrate that his country has managed to survive a year without slipping back into civil war .

critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .
the germans have done their homework in tokyo well , but it ’ s actually rather symbolic , like germany wanting to take over the isaf -lrb- un international peacekeeping force in kabul -rrb- , " said bernt glatzer , chairman of the afghan research group , an informal association of scholars , writers , diplomats and aid and development workers who have worked or still work in or on afghanistan . " in terms of quantity , it isn ’ t very much . " glatzer , just back from afghanistan , says what ’ s missing when it comes to german aid to afghanistan is " a concept . "
" the projects need to make more sense , " he said .
as an example he cites the need to invest more in " providing drinking water , in the energy sector and in a market economy , to promote small businesses and to encourage vocational training programs . "
disarming the need of the day though he concedes that germany has done much to reopen shattered schools , glatzer says young men , rather than children , need serious attention .
money should go to programs that keep youths off the streets and into jobs , especially those in the ages between 16 and 26 , who are susceptible to take up arms for warlords to earn a living .
" though it ’ s not officially said , disarming of armed rebels is the most important priority .
all projects whether they ’ re in the civil area or vocational training should be set up keeping in mind the problem of weapons in the country , " he said .
afghanistan is skating on thin ice with president karsai caught between trying to placate his government members from various ethnic groups and an increasingly discontented population who don ’ t regard the government as a " legitimate " one .
the danger of guns and armed conflict lurking below the surface adds to the political tension in the country .
petersberg important for symbolic reasons though he doesn ’ t expect much from the upcoming petersberg conference , glatzer believes that the conference will be " useful " in keeping afghanistan in the public memory and allowing president karsai to demonstrate that his country has managed to survive a year without slipping back into civil war .
that would also justify karsai making another appeal for international aid . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german foreign ministry 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .
in a telephone conversation with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of denmark , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , bush also stressed " the importance of the copenhagen summit for advancing turkey 's evolution towards the eu .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .
in a telephone conversation with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of denmark , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , bush also stressed " the importance of the copenhagen summit for advancing turkey 's evolution towards the eu .

he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .
“ just like that , ” he laughs and answers the call .
it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .
that goes for films about music as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmplakat " viel passiert - der bap film , wim wenders , film , regisseur music has been the topic of wenders ’ last three films .
the hugely successful cinematic tribute to the aging musicians of cuba ’ s buena vista social club was followed by a film about the somewhat younger music-makers of bap , a band from cologne -lrb- photo -rrb- .
that film , however , was a flop , drawing just 30,000 people to the theatres .
but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .
this wenders homage to two blues legends , skip james and j.p. lenoir , will be called “ devil got my woman ” and should be ready … at some point .
a family road farce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders headshot , german movie director the next project is already lined up .
this time wenders is taking a break from music and directing a feature film .
he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .
still , he doesn ’ t want to the leave the us again , like he did when ronald reagan was elected .
the “ petty nationalism ” that has reared its head since september 11th will pass , he says .
no mincing of words wim wenders doesn ’ t limit himself to the world of purely aesthetic concerns and isn ’ t one to shy away from politics , especially when decisions are made that he feels are wrong .
in the sphere for foreign affairs , for example , he wants to see europe come up with a clear position regarding israel .
domestically , he has spoken out for greater transparency in the german political party system .
time is precious for wim wenders , still , he likes to chat , about just about anything — about how painful it is that his soccer team fortuna düsseldorf is doing so badly , about how much he liked the film “ halbe treppe , ” about what kind of advice dennis hopper once gave him regarding interviews .

boycott of europe loses steam europe -pipe- 21.11.2002 nato summit : air kisses , but little love between bush , schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has formally asked germany to contribute to a possible u.s.-led war against iraq .
a pre-summit , informal handshake was as far as niceties went between gerhard schröder and george w.bush , a sign that all is not well in u.s.-german relations despite reassurances to the contrary . as nato celebrated an historic day in prague inviting seven former communist countries to join the alliance , two of its longest-serving members were frantically trying to play down their differences .
the relationship between germany and the united states has been strained ever since chancellor gerhard schröder took an uncompromising stance on germany 's role in a potential u.s.-led iraq war .
although both sides have been at pains to reassure the public that relations have reached a degree of normalcy , it is clear that a great deal of that is wishful thinking especially on germany 's part .
thus it came as no surprise that german government circles dwelled extensively on the handshake between the chancellor and president george w. bush on the eve of the summit .
" it was a long and firm handshake , " a spokesman said .
frosty relationship other observers noted , however , that both men appeared to be steering clear of each other , sitting at opposite ends at an official summit gathering on wednesday night .
the general view is that it will take a lot more than a handshake to bring the two sides closer together again .
bush aides say the president is still seething about schröder 's intransigence over iraq before the german election when schöder categorically ruled out his country 's participation in a possible conflict .
to make matters worse , the then-german justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , likened bush 's political tactics to those employed by nazi dictator adolf hitler .
bush then refused to offer schröder his congratulations on winning the election .
" professional " approach although a recent visit to washington by foreign minister joschka fischer seems to indicate a slow rapprochement between the two sides , a senior bush aide said that the president would conduct himself with " professionalism " in relations with schröder from now on .
and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "
however , he stressed the importance of the historical ties between the united states and europe .
" we are tied to europe by the wars of liberty we have fought ... we 're joined by broad ties of trade ... america believes that a strong , confident europe is good for the world .
we welcome the economic integration of europe .
we believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the atlantic . "
support for turkey on the subject of european union enlargement , turkish officials said that bush had told his counterpart ahmet necdet sezer of his support for turkey 's bid to join the eu , adding that he had lobbied eu leaders encouraging them to take an " appropriate decision " at the upcoming summit on enlargement in copenhagen .
in a telephone conversation with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of denmark , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , bush also stressed " the importance of the copenhagen summit for advancing turkey 's evolution towards the eu .

and in a veiled barb at schröder , bush said on wednesday that european democracies should not be inward-looking or isolated by indifference .
he also made the point that europe was " wounded by nazism and communism . "

critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .
aid not flowing to the right projects ?
but while the german government pats itself on the back for its excellent track record in afghanistan , critics point out that the generous aid is often diverted to a clutch of diverse projects , that aren ’ t necessarily the pressing need of the day .
" this whole business of german aid in afghanistan is exaggerated in germany .
the germans have done their homework in tokyo well , but it ’ s actually rather symbolic , like germany wanting to take over the isaf -lrb- un international peacekeeping force in kabul -rrb- , " said bernt glatzer , chairman of the afghan research group , an informal association of scholars , writers , diplomats and aid and development workers who have worked or still work in or on afghanistan . " in terms of quantity , it isn ’ t very much . " glatzer , just back from afghanistan , says what ’ s missing when it comes to german aid to afghanistan is " a concept . "
" the projects need to make more sense , " he said .
as an example he cites the need to invest more in " providing drinking water , in the energy sector and in a market economy , to promote small businesses and to encourage vocational training programs . "
disarming the need of the day though he concedes that germany has done much to reopen shattered schools , glatzer says young men , rather than children , need serious attention .
money should go to programs that keep youths off the streets and into jobs , especially those in the ages between 16 and 26 , who are susceptible to take up arms for warlords to earn a living .
" though it ’ s not officially said , disarming of armed rebels is the most important priority .
all projects whether they ’ re in the civil area or vocational training should be set up keeping in mind the problem of weapons in the country , " he said .
afghanistan is skating on thin ice with president karsai caught between trying to placate his government members from various ethnic groups and an increasingly discontented population who don ’ t regard the government as a " legitimate " one .
the danger of guns and armed conflict lurking below the surface adds to the political tension in the country .
petersberg important for symbolic reasons though he doesn ’ t expect much from the upcoming petersberg conference , glatzer believes that the conference will be " useful " in keeping afghanistan in the public memory and allowing president karsai to demonstrate that his country has managed to survive a year without slipping back into civil war .
that would also justify karsai making another appeal for international aid . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german foreign ministry 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

critics say it ’ s time to check whether afghanistan ’ s biggest donor is putting its money in the right places . though details on the upcoming afghanistan conference near bonn on december 2 are still being drawn up , one thing is clear .
this time the meeting will not be a long drawn-out affair like the one a year ago , which saw delegates from various afghan factions and ethnic groups take nine long days to hammer out a plan for an interim administration .
with an elected - if somewhat shaky - government in place , the taliban long ousted and repair work underway in earnest , afghanistan has come a long way from the devastated country that it was before us forces toppled the fundamentalist taliban regime a year ago .
fischer 's idea for petersberg follow-up a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry told dw-world that the one-day conference scheduled for december 2 was initiated at the personal behest of the german foreign minister joschka fischer .
the foreign minister is set to leave for kabul next week to lay the groundwork and visit german troops stationed there .
titled , " rebuilding afghanistan : peace and stability " , the conference will " take stock of germany ’ s role so far in repairing afghanistan and discuss the next stage of rebuilding the country , " said the spokeswoman . though the situation in afghanistan is anything but peaceful and stable , the conference will not focus strictly on security and military issues , but rather " throw a political spotlight on the country , " the spokeswoman said .
afghan president hamid karsai and members of his cabinet as well as representatives from the united nations and neighboring countries who have played a role in rebuilding afghanistan are expected to participate in the conference , which will again take place in the petersberg hotel atop a hill overlooking the rhine river .
glowing german track record in afghanistan last week , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul presented a glowing report on german aid to afghanistan in parliament .
from the 360 million euro for four years pledged by germany at the international donor conference in tokyo last year , the country has already invested 80 million euro in concrete projects in 2002 .
the money has been directed towards renovating and equipping damaged hospitals and schools , setting up vocational training programs for women and helping the country develop a trained police force .
berlin has also freed up a further 46 million euro making the total amount of german aid to afghanistan in 2002 a whopping 126 million euro .

a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others . " like parma ham " the catholic and protestant churches started an anti-body worlds campaign when the show came to berlin in february 2001 .
the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "
pulsfort held a catholic requiem for the dead people displayed in the berlin exhibition . in germany and britain people have taken legal action against " body worlds , " claiming that the exhibition disturbs the dead and abuses corpses for artistic aims .
none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .
in march 2001 , a german tv current affairs program alleged that one of the bodies had a tattoo showing it came from a russian prison camp . half a year earlier von hagens had indeed contracted the anatomical institute of the university of novosibirsk to deliver around 150 brains and some 50 bodies to him in heidelberg .
von hagens insisted that the bodies displayed in berlin had already been prepared before the siberian business deal came about and that the tattoo belonged to a german man who he had personally known .
nevertheless , von hagens cancelled the contract to avoid further bad publicity . " body worlds " remains popular , despite - or perhaps thanks to - the controversy surrounding it .
five people a day signed disposition forms to donate their bodies to the heidelberg institute for plastination during the berlin exhibition , a german newspaper reported . whether or not von hagens is arrested for performing the autopsy , the publicity will surely translate to more visitors to " body worlds .

a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .
but police still are n't sure whether he broke the law . a controversial german professor treated an audience of 500 to a particularly gruesome sight in a london brewery on wednesday evening : an autopsy . defying british authorities , gunther von hagens dissected the corpse of a 72-year-old man on wednesday - the first public autopsy in britain in 170 years .
police still have n't decided whether it was illegal . " this is a democratic country and i 'm sure there will be no arrest , " the professor told the media before the dissection . von hagens believes he found a loophole that will protect him from legal action .
british law requires licensing for medical school dissections but not for post mortems .
the doctor neither had permission to perform autopsies in britain , nor was the venue - a brewery in london 's east end - licensed for the practice .
if convicted von hagens could be sentenced to three months in prison . " we will review the evidence and see if any offence has been committed , " a london police spokesman said . von hagens carried out the post mortem on a german who died last march .
the doctor cut the corpse open from shoulder to shoulder , removing the corpse 's organs , which were than passed around the audience .
later in the evening the autopsy was broadcast on british television with the consent of the dead man and his family . bodies are odorless , durable the 57-year-old professor is the initiator and organizer of the controversial exhibition " body worlds " which has displayed skinned human and animal corpses to nine million visitors since it first opened in japan in 1996 . the exhibit is the result of von hagens groundbreaking work in the preservation of bodies while at the university of heidelberg in 1978 . he calls his technique of corpse preservation “ plastination . ” plastinated corpses are durable , lifelike and odorless and are used institutes worldwide for research and instruction . the exhibition has been shown intermittently over the past five years throughout germany and has drawn criticism from the religious circles and legal experts , among others . " like parma ham " the catholic and protestant churches started an anti-body worlds campaign when the show came to berlin in february 2001 .
the churches object to the way von hagens deals with death and accuse him of disturbing the rest of the dead . pastor ernst pulsfort called the exhibition , which features flayed corpses " like parma ham " posed as a chess player and a headless horseman , " shameless and irreverent . "
pulsfort held a catholic requiem for the dead people displayed in the berlin exhibition . in germany and britain people have taken legal action against " body worlds , " claiming that the exhibition disturbs the dead and abuses corpses for artistic aims .
none of the accusations has held up in court though - german judges ruled that von hagens exhibits are n't corpses in a legal sense . negative publicity while controversy has attracted attention to the show , von hagens detractors have also dealt him some blows .

he met with dw-world to discuss , among other things , a revolution in filmmaking , recent and upcoming projects and american politics . wim wenders never has much time , and at the moment the time he does have is particularly valuable .
sound technicians in los angeles are waiting on him to start mixing his latest movie soundtrack .
but they ’ re going to have wait a while longer , since the editing isn ’ t done yet and that takes priority .
at the same time , wenders has to write up the conceptual plan for the newly established chair of “ visuals science ” at the academy of fine arts in hamburg .
the people in hamburg are just as anxious for a bit of wenders ’ time as those in los angeles are .
" just like that “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director is still in berlin , in the capital city 's hip mitte neighborhood to be exact .
he calls this central berlin district his home for half of the year , the other half he spends in los angeles .
although he was born in the city of düsseldorf , berlin remains his true love .
“ if i feel at home anywhere , it ’ s in berlin , ” he says , even though hamburg is the city that makes the most demands on his time these days .
not long ago he joined the “ reverse angle ” production company which has its headquarters there .
next semester he ’ ll become a professor at the academy of fine arts .
how did that happen ?
right then his mobile phone rings .
“ just like that , ” he laughs and answers the call .
it ’ s his wife calling from tokyo .
she ’ s a painter and is having her first exhibition .
a professor in revolutionary times according to wenders , the transition from analog to digital production techniques is just as much a revolutionary event in the world of cinema as the introduction of talking pictures .
digital technology is cinema ’ s “ big chance , ” he says , and for up-and-coming directors , a fantastic opportunity .
finally , he said , films can be produced without huge financial constraints .
the fact that one can again see independent , director-driven films and documentaries in cinemas at all , he says , is due to these new digital technologies .
that goes for films about music as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmplakat " viel passiert - der bap film , wim wenders , film , regisseur music has been the topic of wenders ’ last three films .
the hugely successful cinematic tribute to the aging musicians of cuba ’ s buena vista social club was followed by a film about the somewhat younger music-makers of bap , a band from cologne -lrb- photo -rrb- .
that film , however , was a flop , drawing just 30,000 people to the theatres .
but wenders takes the ups and downs in stride .
now those sound technicians in los angeles are waiting for the director to guide them in mixing his most recent music-related endeavor .
again , it deals with men advanced in years , but this time they ’ re playing the blues .
this wenders homage to two blues legends , skip james and j.p. lenoir , will be called “ devil got my woman ” and should be ready … at some point .
a family road farce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders headshot , german movie director the next project is already lined up .
this time wenders is taking a break from music and directing a feature film .
he wrote the script to “ don ’ t come knocking ” with american playwright sam shepard and production is slated to begin in the spring .
the film will shot in wenders ’ favorite american landscapes , the western states of arizona , nevada and montana .
it ’ s going to be another road move , but a “ family road farce ” this time , he says .
the director looks forward to being back in the united states .
not long ago , he had a satellite dish installed on his roof so that he could watch german soccer .
“ and only for that one reason , ” he insists .
he says he enjoys living in the us , although he calls the 2000 election that bush eventually won a “ distressing ” event .
yes , he had counted on something like that happening and he said the return of a new mccarthy era is a real possibility .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- politics -pipe- uk accused over foot-and-mouth news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : uk : politics news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england n ireland scotland wales politics education business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk thursday , 21 november , 2002 , 05:30 gmt uk accused over foot-and-mouth farm jabs could avoid burning animals on pyres vaccinating animals must be used as the measure of first resort in a future foot-and-mouth outbreak , according to a damning report into last year 's uk crisis .
the report , by a committee of the european parliament , insists that a mass cull of animals on the scale carried out by the government to combat the widespread outbreak of the disease " will not be publicly acceptable again " .
the government has done everything in its powers to hide this evidence from the british people robert sturdy it claims some farmers were intimidated and pressurised in connection with the culls .
tory mep robert sturdy said the report , the outcome of a year-long inquiry , " should shame the government " .
" its inept handling of the foot-and-mouth outbreak is now well documented , " he said .
" it is no surprise that the government has done everything in its powers to hide this evidence from the british people . "
the report shows that the outbreak could have been better contained if animal movements had been banned , he says .
" there is also clear evidence that the government has been falsifying figures in an attempt to play down the true impact of the outbreak .
" government figures suggest that six million animals were slaughtered .
our findings point to a figure of 10 million . "
' balanced assessment ' labour meps had warned last year that the inquiry would be used by the conservatives as a " witch hunt " .
but gordon adam , labour 's farm spokesman in the european parliament , stressed that its findings were " a reasonably balanced assessment of what was the largest outbreak of foot-and-mouth ever recorded anywhere in the world " .
" the report does not neglect the horrors of the crisis nor the trauma suffered by those involved either directly or indirectly , " he said .
the report should ' shame the government ' " nor does it run away from the mistakes in policy or of administration : it largely succeeds in concentrating on those issues which need to be addressed at european level " .
mr adam said that when the first case of foot-and-mouth was confirmed , 57 farms in 16 counties were already infected - far beyond the scale of any reasonable contingency planning .
" hindsight has been the main witness , " he said , adding : " my main concern has been that we should not give the impression to the farming community or the general public that slaughter can be replaced by vaccination . "
avoid mass burial but the inquiry says that " in any future outbreak , emergency vaccinations , with the aim of allowing animals to live for normal further use , should no longer be regarded as a last resort for controlling fmd but must be considered as a first choice option from the outset " .
emergency vaccinations must be carried out " in those cases in which it is possible to avoid mass burial or burning on pyres " .
the report argues that " the large number of animals culled caused enormous problems in the disposal of animal carcasses which could ... have been reduced by means of vaccination on neighbouring farms within a certain radius of infected farms " .
failure by the government to impose an immediate movement ban led to a " considerable increase in a number of cases " .
there were " considerable shortcomings " in contingency plans and logistical and staffing preparations for an fmd outbreak in the uk .
" these shortcomings and the sometimes inadequate information policy caused considerable stress among those concerned , " the report says .
shocking it continues : " the british government 's decision to bury animal carcasses in mass graves or burn them on pyres as part of the mass culls was , at least in some cases , taken without adequate consultation of local institutions .
" because of this , there were breaches of human and environmental health guidelines from emissions and groundwater pollution .
" it placed a huge burden on the populations of the areas concerned , and television pictures of the burning pyres and mass burials shocked the public on animal welfare grounds and had a catastrophic impact on tourism in those areas . "
the report is set to go before the european parliament in december for final approval .
it stresses that in case of future similar outbreaks , compensation go to businesses such as tourism and not just to farmers .
a spokesman for the department for the environment , food and rural affairs said the inquiry , with which government ministers and experts co-operated fully , was looking at the " broader eu picture " and not just the uk .
" we look forward to publication of the final report in december which is expected to be of considerable value in future eu-wide considerations of foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic animal diseases . "

avoid mass burial but the inquiry says that " in any future outbreak , emergency vaccinations , with the aim of allowing animals to live for normal further use , should no longer be regarded as a last resort for controlling fmd but must be considered as a first choice option from the outset " .
emergency vaccinations must be carried out " in those cases in which it is possible to avoid mass burial or burning on pyres " .
the report argues that " the large number of animals culled caused enormous problems in the disposal of animal carcasses which could ... have been reduced by means of vaccination on neighbouring farms within a certain radius of infected farms " .
failure by the government to impose an immediate movement ban led to a " considerable increase in a number of cases " .
there were " considerable shortcomings " in contingency plans and logistical and staffing preparations for an fmd outbreak in the uk .
" these shortcomings and the sometimes inadequate information policy caused considerable stress among those concerned , " the report says .
shocking it continues : " the british government 's decision to bury animal carcasses in mass graves or burn them on pyres as part of the mass culls was , at least in some cases , taken without adequate consultation of local institutions .
" because of this , there were breaches of human and environmental health guidelines from emissions and groundwater pollution .
" it placed a huge burden on the populations of the areas concerned , and television pictures of the burning pyres and mass burials shocked the public on animal welfare grounds and had a catastrophic impact on tourism in those areas . "
the report is set to go before the european parliament in december for final approval .
it stresses that in case of future similar outbreaks , compensation go to businesses such as tourism and not just to farmers .
a spokesman for the department for the environment , food and rural affairs said the inquiry , with which government ministers and experts co-operated fully , was looking at the " broader eu picture " and not just the uk .
" we look forward to publication of the final report in december which is expected to be of considerable value in future eu-wide considerations of foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic animal diseases . "

joint efforts by the british and jamaican authorities include swabs being used to detect minute traces of cocaine on the skin of drug mules before they board flights to the uk .
on some flights earlier this year , it was estimated as many as 10 % of passengers from jamaica were drug mules , people who had swallowed bags of cocaine usually at the behest of gangsters .

cocaine swallowers can carry half a kilo of the drug in their stomachs wrapped in up to 100 packets .

the drug mules are often women from poor communities desperate for money and seen as dispensible by the traffickers .

the proliferation of the trade between jamaica and the uk has been blamed for a series of violent crimes and shootings in britain , particularly in london and manchester .

cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor said he had not turned a blind eye to paedophile priests while bishop of arundel and brighton .
in his letter to the times , he also denied allegations in the newspaper that victims had been paid " hush money " by the church .
many others feel deeply concerned by the apparently relentless attacks by parts of the media on their faith cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor rounding on the " welter of accusation , allegation and innuendo " , the cardinal said the media was guilty of a " relentless attack " .
cardinal murphy-o 'connor has ridden out criticisms since it was revealed in 2000 that he had appointed priest michael hill to the chaplaincy of gatwick airport despite being warned he posed a serious risk to children .
calls for his resignation intensified this week after bbc and times investigations into his time as bishop of the arundel and brighton diocese .
released in 2000 after a three-year sentence for child abuse , hill was sentenced to five years in jail on thursday after admitting more offences against boys in his care .
new guidelines in the letter to the times , the cardinal said all allegations made against priests in his diocese had been investigated either by social services or the police .
he said new guidelines meant priests would now be removed if allegations were well-founded but did not lead to a conviction .
but the cardinal said the failure to deal with such cases in the 1980s had been on the part of society rather as well as the church , with the full , compulsive nature of paedophilia not yet known .
michael hill will be sentenced on thursday the bbc examined the cases of four priests who had serious allegations made against them in the diocese during the cardinal 's tenure , and found three had been allowed to continue in their pastoral duties while being investigated .
the cardinal apologised for the suffering caused at the hands of hill , saying : " my decision to appoint michael hill to the chaplaincy at gatwick airport , after receiving conflicting psychiatric reports regarding his condition , was a mistake .
" i am deeply sorry for the damage he has done , and to the extent that my decision contributed to any of that damage . "
but he decried the way the media was covering the scandal , saying : " hush money is a deliberate misnomer .
" compensation is agreed between solicitors acting in a professional capacity , and in accordance with agreed norms . "
the cardinal added : " you also suggest that some may feel a sense of betrayal arising from mistakes the church has made has made in the past , including in relation to paedophilia .
" i suggest in turn that many others feel deeply concerned by the apparently relentless attacks by parts of the media on their faith , and on the church in which they continue to believe .

" these 5,000 job cuts announced for 2003 are in addition to the 1,200 to 1,500 reductions announced last month , " said spokesman bill cogswell .
" the cuts will be in all areas , hourly workers , salaried , engineers , non-union , managers and executives " .
in total , boeing has announced up to 36,500 job cuts since the sharp downturn in air traffic since last year 's 11 september attacks .
" we announced last year we were cutting 30,000 jobs worldwide in 2002 and we 're on schedule , " mr cogswell said .
next year 's job cuts are due to hit workers in boeing 's commercial jet division and its services unit .
recovery boeing 's bad news coincided with optimistic predictions about travel volume during next week 's thanksgiving holiday in the us as the american people 's travel pattern returns to normal following 11 september .
and as people once again take to the skies , demand for aircraft from the airlines should eventually pick up .
" while none of us likes the idea of additional reductions , it looks like the worst is certainly behind us , " boeing commercial aircraft president alan mulally told workers .
union officials criticised boeing 's decision .
" we had thought this was levelling off , " said machinist union official mark blondin who represents the largest labour force at boeing .
" we have received the brunt of the cutting and we have members working more overtime than they want .
" we 're disappointed that the company did n't spread out some of this work , instead of cutting jobs . "

the research team from cardiff university and the university of waikato in new zealand believes the combination of honey 's high sugar content and its syrupy texture would act as a natural barrier to bacteria entering wounds .
the tests could have a major impact on the way hospitals tackle outbreaks of bugs , such as mrsa , which have infected 3,000 patients so far this year .
earlier this year , scientists from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign published research showing honey contained antioxidants , which are beneficial in lowering cholesterol .
the centre of bio medical sciences in cardiff has conducted tests on bacteria gathered from infected patients and from hospitals , which proved highly resistant to antibiotics .

with the emergence of antibiotics in the 1950s as a means of killing off infection , centuries of knowledge were overridden by the need for modern drugs to tackle infections .

gus is to pay £ 900m -lrb- $ 1.4bn -rrb- for homebase in an effort to broaden its retail operations , the company confirmed on thursday .
gus said homebase would become part of its argos catalogue store operation , but would continue to trade under its own brand name .
" the acquisition of homebase is a further example of our determination to create shareholder value , " said gus chief executive john peace .
" the -lrb- argos retail group -rrb- management team is well-equipped to drive homebase 's future growth and development . "
for sale the homebase acquisition follows the stock market launch of gus ' highest profile retail operation , the burberry fashion group , earlier this year .
homebase , which runs 300 stores in the uk , was sold to private equity firm permira by its former owner , the supermarket chain j sainsbury , in march last year .
permira , which paid £ 750m for homebase , looks set to reap a hefty profit by selling the retailer on to gus .
part of the £ 900m purchase price agreed by gus will go towards covering some of of homebase 's debts .
the diy firm was reported to be considering a stock market flotation earlier this year .
gus ' other businesses include the experian credit-checking firm and a range of south african retail operations .
profits soar news of the homebase takeover came as gus said profits before taxes and one-off costs had risen to £ 247m in the six months to late september , 20 % up on the same period last year .
mr peace said he was " confident " of the outlook for the next six months , " while remaining mindful of the potential impact of economic and political uncertainty . "
investors welcomed the news , marking gus shares 4.3 % higher to 612.5p by late afternoon .
buying homebase gives gus a foothold in the booming uk home improvements market , currently dominated by kingfisher 's b & q chain .

gus is to pay £ 900m -lrb- $ 1.4bn -rrb- for homebase in an effort to broaden its retail operations , the company confirmed on thursday .
gus said homebase would become part of its argos catalogue store operation , but would continue to trade under its own brand name .
" the acquisition of homebase is a further example of our determination to create shareholder value , " said gus chief executive john peace .
" the -lrb- argos retail group -rrb- management team is well-equipped to drive homebase 's future growth and development . "
for sale the homebase acquisition follows the stock market launch of gus ' highest profile retail operation , the burberry fashion group , earlier this year .
homebase , which runs 300 stores in the uk , was sold to private equity firm permira by its former owner , the supermarket chain j sainsbury , in march last year .
permira , which paid £ 750m for homebase , looks set to reap a hefty profit by selling the retailer on to gus .
part of the £ 900m purchase price agreed by gus will go towards covering some of of homebase 's debts .
the diy firm was reported to be considering a stock market flotation earlier this year .
gus ' other businesses include the experian credit-checking firm and a range of south african retail operations .
profits soar news of the homebase takeover came as gus said profits before taxes and one-off costs had risen to £ 247m in the six months to late september , 20 % up on the same period last year .
mr peace said he was " confident " of the outlook for the next six months , " while remaining mindful of the potential impact of economic and political uncertainty . "
investors welcomed the news , marking gus shares 4.3 % higher to 612.5p by late afternoon .
buying homebase gives gus a foothold in the booming uk home improvements market , currently dominated by kingfisher 's b & q chain .
gus said the diy market had grown by 8 % annually over the past five years to a total value of about £ 12bn .

ken livingstone wants to bring in a by-law which would leave people who scatter bird seed in the area at risk of being taken to court .
he believes the pigeons are a health hazard and create a mess in the square .
the mayor blames the pigeons ' corrosive droppings for causing £ 140,000 of damage to nelson 's column and the square .
birds ' over-fed ' mr livingstone said : " the incessant feeding of the pigeons is deeply unpleasant for visitors to the square and the pigeon faeces causes contamination and damage and costs us hundreds of thousands of pounds in clean-up costs .
" the real problem is not the pigeons themselves , but the vandals who stupidly continue to over-feed the birds despite their promise to reduce the amount of feed slowly . "
two years ago licensed feed sellers were banned from the square in an attempt to reduce the numbers of pigeons .
people are employed to scare off the birds with hawks and megaphones and a vacuum device is used to suck up the seeds .
but volunteers continue to turn up every day to scatter seeds , attracting an estimated 4,000 pigeons to the square .
