rick belluzzo , who many analysts had seen as a rising star at microsoft , said he was leaving the post on 1 may to start his own firm .
" i decided it was the right time to pursue my goal of leading my own company , " mr belluzzo said .
microsoft said it had no plans to replace mr belluzzo , and was transferring many of his powers to chief executive steve ballmer .
analysts ' questions the announcement surprised many wall street observers , who had seen mr belluzzo as a future microsoft chief executive .
he had only joined the firm in 1999 , after spells at hewlett-packard and silicon graphics , and rose rapidly from vice-president to president .
" you do n't normally put someone in that role in order to take him out of there a few months later , " observed rob enderle , an analyst with giga information group .
but mr belluzzo scoffed at reports he had been being groomed for the chief executive role .
" with chairman bill gates and mr ballmer set to be around for some time ...
i never thought that was my ambition here , " he said .
before being appointed president , mr belluzzo 's work focussed on the xbox gaming system and the msn instant messaging service .
" rick has made important contributions throughout his tenure here at microsoft , " mr gates said .
company shake-up following mr belluzzo 's departure , all six of microsoft 's business units will report to mr ballmer , with divisions given more responsibility for their own fiscal and operational performance .
analysts said the shake-up would make it easier for microsoft to split itself into multiple companies .
microsoft was briefly ordered to split itself up in its lengthy antitrust battle with the us government , but the ruling was overturned .
microsoft says the restructuring is nothing to do with the antitrust trial .
mr belluzzo said he would retain a consulting role with microsoft until september to " ensure a smooth transition . "

"
there is nothing false or complicated about the public response to her death ... she loved her country and her country loved her " tony blair prime minister he was leading politicians from all sides in paying their respects , as both houses of parliament and the scottish parliament were recalled .
speaking to a packed house of commons , mr blair praised the queen mother 's " extraordinary vigour " , her love of life , her humour and sense of duty .
mr blair concluded : " there is nothing false or complicated about the public response to her death .
it 's the simplest of equations .
she loved her country and her country loved her . "
conservative leader iain duncan smith said : " we are proud to have shared in the life of this deeply loved and remarkable lady . "
royal vigil liberal democrat leader charles kennedy spoke of the " special place the queen mother always had in the hearts of scottish people " because of " her warmth and because she identified so strongly with us " .
senior parliamentarians including labour 's tam dalyell , ulster unionist leader david trimble and former scottish national party leader alex salmond paid their own tributes to the queen mother and shared memories of their meetings with her over the years .
bbc news online looks back over the remarkable life and times of the queen mother parliament 's recall comes ahead of a ceremony on friday when the royal coffin will be carried to lie in state at westminster hall until the funeral in westminster abbey on tuesday .
meanwhile , the duke of york has visited st james ' palace to pay his respects to his grandmother .
he spent time in the queen 's chapel before moving on to sign the book of condolence and meet well-wishers gathered outside .
the duke then walked down the mall to clarence house , the queen mother 's london residence , where he said the four grandsons - prince charles , prince edward , lord linley and himself - planned to hold a vigil while the queen mother 's body lay in state .
" we each had an individual and unique relationship with our grandmother , " the duke of york said .
" she was very , very special indeed . "
' steadfast service ' lord williams of mostyn , the leader of the lords , led peers by praising the queen mother 's " charm , dignity and steadfast service " .
in scotland , the parliament held a one minute silence before party leaders led by first minister jack mcconnell paid their tributes .
at westminster - last recalled after the us terror attacks - the commons benches were packed although some labour mps with republican views had been expected to stay away , and some other politicians were abroad and unable to return .
downing street has resisted calls from some mps who want wednesday 's tributes to be followed by an emergency debate about ongoing violence in the middle east .
state honours under current plans , the queen mother will receive a royal ceremonial funeral .
protocol reserves state funerals for heads of state .
parliament can decide to grant the accolade to other key national figures , as it did for nelson , wellington and churchill , but that move is thought unlikely on this occasion .
buckingham palace stresses the main elements of a state funeral are " absolutely identical " to the ceremonial funeral the queen mother will receive .
the core difference is the government pays for state funerals , while the queen bears much of the costs for royal ceremonial funerals .
military spectacular the queen mother 's coffin made a low-key arrival in london on tuesday and is resting at st james 's palace for a period of private mourning for the royal family .
on wednesday a special service is being held at the forfar church in scotland where she was confirmed at the age of 16 .
parliament will again be centre stage on friday , when a military spectacular is promised as 1,600 troops march with the coffin to westminster hall .
the public will then be able to pay their respects as the coffin lies in state inside the medieval hall on 5 april -lrb- 1400 to 1800 bst -rrb- , and from 6 to 8 april -lrb- 0800 to 1800 bst -rrb- .
politicians from around the commonwealth will attend the funeral itself in westminster abbey next tuesday .

according to clarke , his successor now faces plummeting tax revenues at a time when there is a growing clamour over public services . "
i quite agree that people 's recollection is that we made a horlicks of quite a lot of things but most of these things are things we did n't do " ken clarke couple that with some pretty " wild promises " over things like health and transport and the pressure is on the chancellor to deliver .
clarke has a reputation as a combative , cross-the-street-for-a-fight kind of politician .
sitting in his office high up in portcullis house with its view of the millennium wheel , he can look back on a political life in which he had nearly all the big jobs .
home affairs , health , education - he even made it to downing street where he lived at number 11 when he was john major 's chancellor .
claims credit now , having lost the conservative leadership race to a much less experienced iain duncan smith , he seems more bruised than bruiser .
sitting with a huge cigar , he seems determined to preserve his reputation in government now that his frontline political career is all but over .
he claims credit for the economic success of the past few years , but says that brown now faces genuine difficulties as the economy slows .
" he 's got to make sure that he leaves public finances in a reasonably healthy state .
whatever he spends he 's got to raise by taxation .
he 's got to get the balance right . "
clarke accepts that taxes will have to go up and public spending must continue to grow .
but he argues that although health spending must continue to increase overall public expenditure can not continue to go up at the current rate .
delayed tax hike ?
" on any view public expenditure 's got to increase , " he says .
" i personally do n't think that the total of public expenditure can carry on increasing at the present rate but he 's got to increase spending on health and education , " he says .
clarke predicts that when mr brown does increase taxation it will only come into effect at a later date . "
they were totally on course to have a balanced budget , within the course of the economic cycle and the deficit and debt problems they still cite were actually under control well before 1997 " ken clarke " he finds he annoys people less if he makes announcements that do n't have immediate effect and people get over the shock of the announcement then nothing happens - their taxes do n't go up - and they 've forgotten about the announcement before , eventually , they notice their taxes have now gone up . "
so what would clarke be doing if he was still chancellor ?
" i would put it in this order : first what are the right decisions for the benefit of the economy over the next 12 months .
what 's the right mix of tax-and-spending that fit that judgement .
thirdly how you can present it . "
he says that in addition to the pressures on the chancellor because of a " slowing " economy and " tax revenues dropping like a stone " labour backbenchers will be looking to him for a morale boost .
spending limit surprise having squeezed public spending in the first few years of the labour government the chancellor then turned the tap " on rather gushingly for three years " .
the problem now is that there is an expectation among brown 's cabinet colleagues that the money will keep on flowing .
that coincides with a growing clamour about the public services .
clarke continues to express amazement that labour stuck to such tight spending plans in the first couple of years .
members of the government always say that they did so because they had to shed a massive deficit that they inherited in 1997 .
but clarke says that no-one in the government believes that , and he is convinced that neither do many of the public .
mythology ?
" what we left them with was a deficit that was declining .
" they were totally on course to have a balanced budget , within the course of the economic cycle and the deficit and debt problems they still cite were actually under control well before 1997 . "
it is part of the labour " mythology " that they faced all sorts of problems with the economy .
" in fact they did n't and they know they did n't and i 'm absolutely confident that privately they know -lsb- that -rsb- perfectly well . "
he says he accepts that there is a perception among voters that things at the end of the tory years were in a mess .
but clarke is keen to reject the notion that the sort of mess that labour has got itself into with its special advisers would ever have happened under john major .
" one of the things that journalists take at face value was that it was the same under the tories . "
trouble " i quite agree that people 's recollection is that we made a horlicks of quite a lot of things but most of these things are things we did n't do .
" it is not true that we had special advisers doing what they do nor is it true that we used to announce tax increases miles in advance . "
he says there was one occasion when it did happen .
" the only delayed tax increase i can remember ... is norman lamont did it with a two stage increase of vat on fuel which got me into real trouble because the second stage got knocked out and i had to make up for it by raising tax on other things . "

rates were last cut in november to 4.0 % , their lowest rate since january 1963 .
