politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .
but deutsche bahn ceo mehdorn disagrees and lashes out at critics . the overhaul of the german federal railway 's pricing system , introduced on dec .
15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .
bahn ceo lashes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can deutsche bahn stay on track with its new pricing system ?
but bahn ceo helmut mehdorn has n't taken the criticism gently .
while not categorically denying that the new system is flawed , he has also aimed to discredit his critics .
in an interview with the german newsmagazine focus on dec .
29 , mehdorn accused stiftung warentest , an independent institute , of being out of touch with reality and using one-sided test examples aimed at producing a negative result .
mehdorn also dubbed pro bahn chairman karl-peter naumann an " image obsessed functionary , who has to justify his raison d 'être . "
last week a german newspaper quoted naumann as saying that every other train customer pays too much thanks to the new system .
but the pro bahn head insisted on dec .
23 that he was misquoted and had n't made the statement attributed to him .
meanwhile , mehdorn said that the quote was damaging to business .
" we will hold pro bahn responsible for every setback now , " mehdorn ominously warned .

politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .
but deutsche bahn ceo mehdorn disagrees and lashes out at critics . the overhaul of the german federal railway 's pricing system , introduced on dec .
15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .
bahn ceo lashes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can deutsche bahn stay on track with its new pricing system ?
but bahn ceo helmut mehdorn has n't taken the criticism gently .
while not categorically denying that the new system is flawed , he has also aimed to discredit his critics .
in an interview with the german newsmagazine focus on dec .
29 , mehdorn accused stiftung warentest , an independent institute , of being out of touch with reality and using one-sided test examples aimed at producing a negative result .
mehdorn also dubbed pro bahn chairman karl-peter naumann an " image obsessed functionary , who has to justify his raison d 'être . "
last week a german newspaper quoted naumann as saying that every other train customer pays too much thanks to the new system .
but the pro bahn head insisted on dec .
23 that he was misquoted and had n't made the statement attributed to him .
meanwhile , mehdorn said that the quote was damaging to business .

politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .
but deutsche bahn ceo mehdorn disagrees and lashes out at critics . the overhaul of the german federal railway 's pricing system , introduced on dec .
15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .
bahn ceo lashes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can deutsche bahn stay on track with its new pricing system ?
but bahn ceo helmut mehdorn has n't taken the criticism gently .
while not categorically denying that the new system is flawed , he has also aimed to discredit his critics .
in an interview with the german newsmagazine focus on dec .
29 , mehdorn accused stiftung warentest , an independent institute , of being out of touch with reality and using one-sided test examples aimed at producing a negative result .
mehdorn also dubbed pro bahn chairman karl-peter naumann an " image obsessed functionary , who has to justify his raison d 'être . "
last week a german newspaper quoted naumann as saying that every other train customer pays too much thanks to the new system .
but the pro bahn head insisted on dec .
23 that he was misquoted and had n't made the statement attributed to him .
meanwhile , mehdorn said that the quote was damaging to business .
" we will hold pro bahn responsible for every setback now , " mehdorn ominously warned .
deutsche bahn announced it has already taken legal action against naumann and , according to mehdorn , further lawsuits against critics are planned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de consumer group gives new train fare system poor marks on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 31.12.2002 criticism of new german train fares grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways head hartmut mehdorn says criticism just bounces off of him .
politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .
but deutsche bahn ceo mehdorn disagrees and lashes out at critics . the overhaul of the german federal railway 's pricing system , introduced on dec .
15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .
bahn ceo lashes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can deutsche bahn stay on track with its new pricing system ?
but bahn ceo helmut mehdorn has n't taken the criticism gently .
while not categorically denying that the new system is flawed , he has also aimed to discredit his critics .
in an interview with the german newsmagazine focus on dec .
29 , mehdorn accused stiftung warentest , an independent institute , of being out of touch with reality and using one-sided test examples aimed at producing a negative result .
mehdorn also dubbed pro bahn chairman karl-peter naumann an " image obsessed functionary , who has to justify his raison d 'être . "
last week a german newspaper quoted naumann as saying that every other train customer pays too much thanks to the new system .
but the pro bahn head insisted on dec .
23 that he was misquoted and had n't made the statement attributed to him .
meanwhile , mehdorn said that the quote was damaging to business .

politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .
but deutsche bahn ceo mehdorn disagrees and lashes out at critics . the overhaul of the german federal railway 's pricing system , introduced on dec .
15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .
bahn ceo lashes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can deutsche bahn stay on track with its new pricing system ?
but bahn ceo helmut mehdorn has n't taken the criticism gently .
while not categorically denying that the new system is flawed , he has also aimed to discredit his critics .
in an interview with the german newsmagazine focus on dec .
29 , mehdorn accused stiftung warentest , an independent institute , of being out of touch with reality and using one-sided test examples aimed at producing a negative result .
mehdorn also dubbed pro bahn chairman karl-peter naumann an " image obsessed functionary , who has to justify his raison d 'être . "
last week a german newspaper quoted naumann as saying that every other train customer pays too much thanks to the new system .
but the pro bahn head insisted on dec .
23 that he was misquoted and had n't made the statement attributed to him .
meanwhile , mehdorn said that the quote was damaging to business .

15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .

accompanied by chinese prime minister zhu rongji , the chancellor enjoyed a smooth test run of the first commercial magnetic train .
the new " transrapid " magnetic levitation train route , which wo n't officially open to the public until next year , runs 30 kilometres from shanghai 's international airport to the financial district .
it reaches speeds of more than 400 kilometers an hour on a journey that is completed in just 8 minutes .
a $ 1 billion economic boost with germany threatening to slip into recession , schröder is now able to start the year with a slightly more positive economic outlook .
china has currently paid $ 1 billion for the pilot technology .
the money spent on pioneering technology has been a gamble for the germans .
the german government has supported the project with an investment of 700 million euros .
germany now hopes the financial backing will pay off and more orders will follow .
" the close co-operation between the industrial and high-tech sectors has made this important project possible , " schröder said .
but critics argue that at a cost of $ 1 billion per train , the transrapid is an expensive waste of energy .
japan has proved that its high speed trains can almost compete with transrapid on standard tracks .
other routes planned on tuesday , the gambit seemed to have paid off .
speaking after the maiden voyage on the train , china 's zhu said the country intended to expand the line .
" we are planning to extend the length of track to 300 kilometers , " he said .
" we want to build the network as far as hangzhou on one side and nanjing on the other . "
a boost for german-chinese relations the partnership is the latest development in an increased chinese-german cooperation .
germany has already begun to forge a series of successful economic links with the asian superpower and has recently seen a 30 percent increase in foreign trade with china .
this has proven to be a great cooperative effort between china and germany , " schröder said .

accompanied by chinese prime minister zhu rongji , the chancellor enjoyed a smooth test run of the first commercial magnetic train .
the new " transrapid " magnetic levitation train route , which wo n't officially open to the public until next year , runs 30 kilometres from shanghai 's international airport to the financial district .
it reaches speeds of more than 400 kilometers an hour on a journey that is completed in just 8 minutes .
a $ 1 billion economic boost with germany threatening to slip into recession , schröder is now able to start the year with a slightly more positive economic outlook .
china has currently paid $ 1 billion for the pilot technology .
the money spent on pioneering technology has been a gamble for the germans .
the german government has supported the project with an investment of 700 million euros .
germany now hopes the financial backing will pay off and more orders will follow .
" the close co-operation between the industrial and high-tech sectors has made this important project possible , " schröder said .
but critics argue that at a cost of $ 1 billion per train , the transrapid is an expensive waste of energy .
japan has proved that its high speed trains can almost compete with transrapid on standard tracks .
other routes planned on tuesday , the gambit seemed to have paid off .
speaking after the maiden voyage on the train , china 's zhu said the country intended to expand the line .
" we are planning to extend the length of track to 300 kilometers , " he said .
" we want to build the network as far as hangzhou on one side and nanjing on the other . "
a boost for german-chinese relations the partnership is the latest development in an increased chinese-german cooperation .
germany has already begun to forge a series of successful economic links with the asian superpower and has recently seen a 30 percent increase in foreign trade with china .
this has proven to be a great cooperative effort between china and germany , " schröder said .
" this is wonderful german technology and we also have great respect for the achievements of chinese engineers in developing this project .
we are all very pleased .

" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .

politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .
but deutsche bahn ceo mehdorn disagrees and lashes out at critics . the overhaul of the german federal railway 's pricing system , introduced on dec .
15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .
bahn ceo lashes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can deutsche bahn stay on track with its new pricing system ?
but bahn ceo helmut mehdorn has n't taken the criticism gently .
while not categorically denying that the new system is flawed , he has also aimed to discredit his critics .
in an interview with the german newsmagazine focus on dec .
29 , mehdorn accused stiftung warentest , an independent institute , of being out of touch with reality and using one-sided test examples aimed at producing a negative result .
mehdorn also dubbed pro bahn chairman karl-peter naumann an " image obsessed functionary , who has to justify his raison d 'être . "
last week a german newspaper quoted naumann as saying that every other train customer pays too much thanks to the new system .
but the pro bahn head insisted on dec .
23 that he was misquoted and had n't made the statement attributed to him .
meanwhile , mehdorn said that the quote was damaging to business .
" we will hold pro bahn responsible for every setback now , " mehdorn ominously warned .

accompanied by chinese prime minister zhu rongji , the chancellor enjoyed a smooth test run of the first commercial magnetic train .
the new " transrapid " magnetic levitation train route , which wo n't officially open to the public until next year , runs 30 kilometres from shanghai 's international airport to the financial district .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 31.12.2002 criticism of new german train fares grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways head hartmut mehdorn says criticism just bounces off of him .
politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .
but deutsche bahn ceo mehdorn disagrees and lashes out at critics . the overhaul of the german federal railway 's pricing system , introduced on dec .
15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .
bahn ceo lashes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can deutsche bahn stay on track with its new pricing system ?
but bahn ceo helmut mehdorn has n't taken the criticism gently .
while not categorically denying that the new system is flawed , he has also aimed to discredit his critics .
in an interview with the german newsmagazine focus on dec .
29 , mehdorn accused stiftung warentest , an independent institute , of being out of touch with reality and using one-sided test examples aimed at producing a negative result .
mehdorn also dubbed pro bahn chairman karl-peter naumann an " image obsessed functionary , who has to justify his raison d 'être . "
last week a german newspaper quoted naumann as saying that every other train customer pays too much thanks to the new system .
but the pro bahn head insisted on dec .
23 that he was misquoted and had n't made the statement attributed to him .
meanwhile , mehdorn said that the quote was damaging to business .
" we will hold pro bahn responsible for every setback now , " mehdorn ominously warned .
deutsche bahn announced it has already taken legal action against naumann and , according to mehdorn , further lawsuits against critics are planned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de consumer group gives new train fare system poor marks on dec .

politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .
but deutsche bahn ceo mehdorn disagrees and lashes out at critics . the overhaul of the german federal railway 's pricing system , introduced on dec .
15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .
bahn ceo lashes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can deutsche bahn stay on track with its new pricing system ?
but bahn ceo helmut mehdorn has n't taken the criticism gently .
while not categorically denying that the new system is flawed , he has also aimed to discredit his critics .
in an interview with the german newsmagazine focus on dec .
29 , mehdorn accused stiftung warentest , an independent institute , of being out of touch with reality and using one-sided test examples aimed at producing a negative result .
mehdorn also dubbed pro bahn chairman karl-peter naumann an " image obsessed functionary , who has to justify his raison d 'être . "
last week a german newspaper quoted naumann as saying that every other train customer pays too much thanks to the new system .
but the pro bahn head insisted on dec .
23 that he was misquoted and had n't made the statement attributed to him .
meanwhile , mehdorn said that the quote was damaging to business .

politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .
but deutsche bahn ceo mehdorn disagrees and lashes out at critics . the overhaul of the german federal railway 's pricing system , introduced on dec .
15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .
bahn ceo lashes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can deutsche bahn stay on track with its new pricing system ?
but bahn ceo helmut mehdorn has n't taken the criticism gently .
while not categorically denying that the new system is flawed , he has also aimed to discredit his critics .
in an interview with the german newsmagazine focus on dec .
29 , mehdorn accused stiftung warentest , an independent institute , of being out of touch with reality and using one-sided test examples aimed at producing a negative result .
mehdorn also dubbed pro bahn chairman karl-peter naumann an " image obsessed functionary , who has to justify his raison d 'être . "
last week a german newspaper quoted naumann as saying that every other train customer pays too much thanks to the new system .
but the pro bahn head insisted on dec .
23 that he was misquoted and had n't made the statement attributed to him .
meanwhile , mehdorn said that the quote was damaging to business .

politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .
but deutsche bahn ceo mehdorn disagrees and lashes out at critics . the overhaul of the german federal railway 's pricing system , introduced on dec .
15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .
horst friedrich , transportation expert for the business-friendly free democratic party , said making adjustments to the system after a year - as mehdorn announced he plans to do - would be too late .
the politician contended that six months is enough to recognize where changes need to be made .
a spokeswoman for the german transportation ministry told the berliner zeitung newspaper there have been " apparent starting difficulties , " but the ministry does not intend to try to influence deutsche bahn , which though slated for privatization is still a government-owned entity .
random checks undertaken by the consumer protection organization stiftung warentest and german newspapers suggest that many passengers are being overcharged for train journeys .
the passengers organization pro bahn has also been highly critical of the new system , alleging that prices for some routes have increased 100 percent .
pro bahn maintains that younger customers , in particular , are being stuck with greater fees .
bahn ceo lashes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can deutsche bahn stay on track with its new pricing system ?
but bahn ceo helmut mehdorn has n't taken the criticism gently .
while not categorically denying that the new system is flawed , he has also aimed to discredit his critics .
in an interview with the german newsmagazine focus on dec .
29 , mehdorn accused stiftung warentest , an independent institute , of being out of touch with reality and using one-sided test examples aimed at producing a negative result .
mehdorn also dubbed pro bahn chairman karl-peter naumann an " image obsessed functionary , who has to justify his raison d 'être . "
last week a german newspaper quoted naumann as saying that every other train customer pays too much thanks to the new system .
but the pro bahn head insisted on dec .
23 that he was misquoted and had n't made the statement attributed to him .
meanwhile , mehdorn said that the quote was damaging to business .
" we will hold pro bahn responsible for every setback now , " mehdorn ominously warned .
deutsche bahn announced it has already taken legal action against naumann and , according to mehdorn , further lawsuits against critics are planned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de consumer group gives new train fare system poor marks on dec .

15 , was long overdue - at least according to deutsche bahn . but now that the changes have been in effect for two weeks , politicians and consumer protection groups are heaping a large serving of scorn and criticism on deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" obvious shortcomings " transportation experts from three of the four main political parties in germany have come out to criticize the new fare structure .
the new pricing system has " obvious shortcomings , " said dirk fischer of the conservative christian democratic union .
fischer called on bahn 's mehdorn to immediately redress the faults and reintroduce the discontinued " bahn card , " which gave frequent riders a 50 percent discount on normally priced train fares .
green party spokesman albert schmidt also demanded improvements to the new pricing system .

accompanied by chinese prime minister zhu rongji , the chancellor enjoyed a smooth test run of the first commercial magnetic train .
the new " transrapid " magnetic levitation train route , which wo n't officially open to the public until next year , runs 30 kilometres from shanghai 's international airport to the financial district .
it reaches speeds of more than 400 kilometers an hour on a journey that is completed in just 8 minutes .
a $ 1 billion economic boost with germany threatening to slip into recession , schröder is now able to start the year with a slightly more positive economic outlook .
china has currently paid $ 1 billion for the pilot technology .
the money spent on pioneering technology has been a gamble for the germans .
the german government has supported the project with an investment of 700 million euros .

" the close co-operation between the industrial and high-tech sectors has made this important project possible , " schröder said .
but critics argue that at a cost of $ 1 billion per train , the transrapid is an expensive waste of energy .
japan has proved that its high speed trains can almost compete with transrapid on standard tracks .

accompanied by chinese prime minister zhu rongji , the chancellor enjoyed a smooth test run of the first commercial magnetic train .
the new " transrapid " magnetic levitation train route , which wo n't officially open to the public until next year , runs 30 kilometres from shanghai 's international airport to the financial district .
it reaches speeds of more than 400 kilometers an hour on a journey that is completed in just 8 minutes .
a $ 1 billion economic boost with germany threatening to slip into recession , schröder is now able to start the year with a slightly more positive economic outlook .
china has currently paid $ 1 billion for the pilot technology .
the money spent on pioneering technology has been a gamble for the germans .
the german government has supported the project with an investment of 700 million euros .
germany now hopes the financial backing will pay off and more orders will follow .
" the close co-operation between the industrial and high-tech sectors has made this important project possible , " schröder said .
but critics argue that at a cost of $ 1 billion per train , the transrapid is an expensive waste of energy .
japan has proved that its high speed trains can almost compete with transrapid on standard tracks .

germany has already begun to forge a series of successful economic links with the asian superpower and has recently seen a 30 percent increase in foreign trade with china .

seema ghani left a comfortable life here to work for the united nations .
but she found quite quickly that the un was n't enough .
in the final part of our series from afghanistan graham satchell reports on the dramatic changes in seema ghani 's life .
breakfast also spoke to seema ghani live in the programme .
if you have any comments click here to go straight to our e-mail form " a year ago seema ghani could hardly have imagined she 'd be here in kabul - looking after 16 orphaned children .
since we first met her seema 's life has changed almost beyond recognition .
in the summer we followed seema as she said goodbye to her parents in london - and a job in the city .
the end of the taleban regime meant after years of waiting she could finally come back home to afghanistan .
when she first arrived in kabul , seema wanted to do what she could to rebuild her country - so she started working for the un .
but pretty quickly she got frustrated - seema is a woman with a mission and the un was holding back .
" i came to afghanistan to feel that i 'm 100 per cent productive , " she told us . "
within the un the system is a bit slow - particularly life in afghanistan . "
i 'm in a bit of a rush - the country 's in a bit of a rush .
" afghanistan does n't have the patience that people working in the un have - i do n't have that patience . "
when she left the un seema decided to devote her time to her passion .
she 'd always given money to help support a group of afghan orphans .
now she 's taken the life changing decision to look after the orphans herself .
" in the evening i 'm with them - weekends we 're together .
it 's what normal families do - it 's a parent with a few kids . "
seema actually looks after 16 children - in a large house in kabul .
" it 's really important to me and they do call me mother and i do look at them as my children " she explains on a trip to the zoo , the lion is centre of attention - and one of the girls , zamzama is teasing it remorselessly .
behind the safety of the bars zamzama is fearless - but just six months ago she was facing a real threat to her life .
when we first met zamzama she was living in the state run orphanage .
she was terribly ill with a terminal heart condition .
with seema 's help she was flown to india for life saving surgery and today she 's made a full recovery .
" when you and i went to see her she was very quiet and would hardly speak , " seema tells me .
" you had to ask her questions to hear something from her but now you ca n't shut her up - she 's really naughty - the naughtiest in the house . "
looking after 16 kids is an expensive business - so seema 's cooked up a way of making money .
as if she did n't have enough on her plate seema has completely renovated a restaurant and guest house in the centre of kabul .
" it 's got two beautiful buildings .
if we make profits that will pay for my children for our life basically . "
back at the zoo , one of the toys we brought over for the kids is about to meet a sticky end .
emily may have loved him - but bagpus got no mercy from the monkeys at kabul zoo .
afghanistan still has huge problems but you can see in seema 's face that she 's happy here and doing her best to start a new life .
she says : " i feel completely at home now .
i do feel that i 'm really lucky .
i do thank god when i pray thank god that i 'm here its home you know i ca n't imagine myself anywhere else in the world to be honest . "

safeway said it would put up pump prices by an average of 2p per litre from 1 january , taking the average price of a litre of unleaded to 74.9p.
the move came after petrol retail giant bp confirmed it was increasing petrol prices by 1p to an average of 74.8p a litre .
the higher pump prices reflect a sharp jump in the price of crude oil amid fears that a us-led war against iraq could disrupt fuel supplies from the middle east , the world 's biggest oil exporting region .
crude pricing production cuts in venezuela , where a month-long strike has paralysed the oil industry , have also helped to drive crude prices higher .
world oil prices broke through $ 33 -lrb- £ 20.5 -rrb- per barrel on monday , their highest level since december 2000 .
analysts said the strong crude oil market is likely to push other major petrol retailers into raising their prices in turn .
" if prices stay up , then inevitably we will see price increases at the pumps , although oil companies do try to smooth it out , " said hilary cook , director of investment strategy at barclays private clients .
oil producers ' cartel opec is thought to be ready to raise output if crude prices do not drop within the next two weeks .
fuel bills however , the extra production is likely to take several weeks to reach the international market .
the increase in british pump prices are likely to exacerbate consumer resentment over high fuel bills .
british petrol prices are already among the highest in europe because of hefty fuel duties .
two years ago , blockades by angry truck drivers protesting against fuel duties disrupted petrol deliveries across the country , causing massive disruption .

argentina has been cut off from foreign loans since it carried out the biggest ever default by an international borrower a year ago after people rioted against austerity measures .
since then , talks with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- have failed to reach agreement on resuming aid .
but mr ruckauf said the us state department had told him the g7 had " decided to help the imf and argentina reach a deal as soon as possible . "
important player he made the remarks in a local television interview .
the g7 is the biggest shareholder in the imf so its support for any package of measures could carry considerable weight .
however , it remains unclear whether there is a deal on the table .
when an imf team last visited argentina for talks in december 2002 , the country 's president played down the likelihood of progress .
" i do n't think we should build expectations over this visit , " said argentine president eduardo duhalde .
he described the talks as " purely technical " .
since then the argentine senate has passed the government 's 2003 budget , though with amendments that water down some austerity taxes .
the g7 is believed to be discussing backing a short-term agreement between the imf and argentina , which is entering its fifth year of recession .
grassroots anger the imf has insisted that the argentine authorities must show they are serious about trimming state spending and protecting foreign investors before loans can resume .
the argentina government faces a difficult balancing act as popular protests against government restrictions on bank withdrawals and other austerity policies have continued .
" the imf favours an agreement ... the order from the g7 to the imf is that they reach a deal soon , " reuters news agency quoted an argentine official who did not wish to be named as saying .
but an agreement is thought unlikely to mean fresh loans .
analysts think a timetable for rescheduling existing debt repayments is more probable .
bankrupt argentina was once known as the bread basket of latin america , but unemployment is now over 20 % , and there have been deaths from starvation .
the peso has lost 70 % of its value since the government devalued the currency in january 2002 , making imports more expensive and contributing to soaring inflation .

terry confield , of the lochaber mountain rescue team , added that all those who work to save the lives of people stuck on mountains and hills should receive the accolade .
mr confield has been recognised as one of britain 's longest serving mountain rescue experts .
he said : " i 'm absolutely over the moon - i 'm really chuffed .
" i have been in the rescue service for 40 years and i think every member of the rescue service teams should get a medal because it 's all voluntary . "
the 58-year-old estimated that he has taken part in more than 1,000 operations to ben nevis and the surrounding area .
he said that one of his most satisfying rescues was an incident in which two university students became snowbound in the tower ridge area of britain 's highest peak about seven years ago .
the female students were minutes from a 600ft drop when the rescue team appeared and took them to safety despite the presence of widespread avalanches .
mr confield said : " four of us took off and solo-ed up this climb and these two girls were there and had dug themselves into a snow hole as they had done on the first night .
" we were absolutely delighted and certain the whole hard job had been worthwhile to find these two girls alive .
" that 's what makes it all worthwhile . "
mr confield added that the call-out rate for the 42-strong team has increased from about 15 rescues a year when he started 40 years ago , to about 80 a year .
