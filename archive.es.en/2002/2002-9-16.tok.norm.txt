for an entire month , the city and the neighbouring region sway to the lilt of famous sonatas and uplifting compositions by the maestro himself as well as compositions and interpretations of his music by both renowned contemporary musicians and their lesser-known counterparts from all over the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven statue in bonn the annual beethoven festival in bonn is recognised as a platform for international talent to both display their skills and glimpse various interpretations of the great german composer , whose works have made for a lively heritage that continually inspire musicians .
along these lines , this year ’ s international beethoven festival which kicked off on september 6 – apart from numerous compositions by beethoven – focuses on the premieres of works composed by five significant contemporary composers , who have immersed themselves in beethoven ’ s works and spirit .
among them are french composer pascal dusapin , german composers jürg baur and manfred trojahn and spanish composer mauricio sotelo .
beethoven resounds from unlikely regions apart from guest performances by acclaimed orchestras , solo acts by virtuoso artists and chamber music ensembles , a special highlight of the festival is the " orchestra campus " project organised by the beethoven festival together with germany ’ s international broadcaster , deutsche welle .
the aim of the project is to invite a talented young orchestra from a country that has no obvious link with ludwig van beethoven to present their interpretation of beethoven ’ s works .
in return , the predominantly-german audience gets to enjoy the interpretation skills and creative potential of young talent from foreign regions .
though it ’ s difficult to think of turkey as a centre for western classical music , few are aware that the majority muslim country has dozens of music schools , conservatories and symphony orchestras based on european models .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish orchestra this year 80 young talented musicians from the state conservatory of the university of istanbul -lrb- photo -rrb- under the direction of rmiz malik aslanov have made their way to their rhine to show off their skills and get the chance to work with some prominent composers in bonn .
chance in a lifetime for turkish musicians thomas daniel scheel , the director of the beethoven festival is enthused about the orchestra campus project .
" such projects form a special part of a music festival .
the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul - which is wonderfully prepared under maestro malik aslanov – will not just present a finished programme , but we want to use the presence of these young people to give them an impression of the beethoven festival and a few important interpretations that they can take back with them to their own country " , he told dw-radio .
the young turkish musicians , who gave a performance on sunday evening , will also work together with prominent conductors such as krysztof penderecki , helmuth rilling and peter gülke who will take them through the paces in some of beethoven ’ s works as well as other composers .
the results of the co-operative efforts will be visible for all in the form of public workshop concerts .
robust cultural exchange the young musicians , who are staying with families in bonn , attend concerts , make contacts , and generally contribute to the international flair of the festival by participating in a vigorous cultural exchange between the orient and the occident .
naturally the young musicians from istanbul are excited about playing in germany and can hardly wait to meet up with the famous conductors .
beste karajedsin , who plays the clarinet said , " it ’ s very exciting for me to be together with such great personalities , to be allowed to work with them , to be in the same city , to move in the same spheres and to breathe the same air .
it ’ s wonderful " .
beethoven as inspiration an integral part of the orchestra campus project is the deutsche welle prize for best composer which is awarded to an outstanding composer from the guest country .
this time turkish composer özkan manav -lrb- photo -rrb- won the award for his work entitled " portamento lento " which was performed by the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul on sunday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer özkan manav a thrilled manav told dw-radio that he discovered how " close " he felt to beethoven ’ s music when he began composing his award-wining work and how much it " motivated " and " moved " him .
" even today as a composer and music teacher , i consider beethoven one of the heroes of classical music .
in that sense , it ’ s naturally wonderful to be in the same city that beethoven was born in .
and i ’ m really proud of the fact that my work was premiered in a hall that bears the name of beethoven ! " , he said .

the aim of the project is to invite a talented young orchestra from a country that has no obvious link with ludwig van beethoven to present their interpretation of beethoven ’ s works .
in return , the predominantly-german audience gets to enjoy the interpretation skills and creative potential of young talent from foreign regions .
though it ’ s difficult to think of turkey as a centre for western classical music , few are aware that the majority muslim country has dozens of music schools , conservatories and symphony orchestras based on european models .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish orchestra this year 80 young talented musicians from the state conservatory of the university of istanbul -lrb- photo -rrb- under the direction of rmiz malik aslanov have made their way to their rhine to show off their skills and get the chance to work with some prominent composers in bonn .
chance in a lifetime for turkish musicians thomas daniel scheel , the director of the beethoven festival is enthused about the orchestra campus project .
" such projects form a special part of a music festival .
the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul - which is wonderfully prepared under maestro malik aslanov – will not just present a finished programme , but we want to use the presence of these young people to give them an impression of the beethoven festival and a few important interpretations that they can take back with them to their own country " , he told dw-radio .
the young turkish musicians , who gave a performance on sunday evening , will also work together with prominent conductors such as krysztof penderecki , helmuth rilling and peter gülke who will take them through the paces in some of beethoven ’ s works as well as other composers .
the results of the co-operative efforts will be visible for all in the form of public workshop concerts .
robust cultural exchange the young musicians , who are staying with families in bonn , attend concerts , make contacts , and generally contribute to the international flair of the festival by participating in a vigorous cultural exchange between the orient and the occident .
naturally the young musicians from istanbul are excited about playing in germany and can hardly wait to meet up with the famous conductors .
beste karajedsin , who plays the clarinet said , " it ’ s very exciting for me to be together with such great personalities , to be allowed to work with them , to be in the same city , to move in the same spheres and to breathe the same air .
it ’ s wonderful " .
beethoven as inspiration an integral part of the orchestra campus project is the deutsche welle prize for best composer which is awarded to an outstanding composer from the guest country .
this time turkish composer özkan manav -lrb- photo -rrb- won the award for his work entitled " portamento lento " which was performed by the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul on sunday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer özkan manav a thrilled manav told dw-radio that he discovered how " close " he felt to beethoven ’ s music when he began composing his award-wining work and how much it " motivated " and " moved " him .
" even today as a composer and music teacher , i consider beethoven one of the heroes of classical music .
in that sense , it ’ s naturally wonderful to be in the same city that beethoven was born in .
and i ’ m really proud of the fact that my work was premiered in a hall that bears the name of beethoven ! " , he said .

for an entire month , the city and the neighbouring region sway to the lilt of famous sonatas and uplifting compositions by the maestro himself as well as compositions and interpretations of his music by both renowned contemporary musicians and their lesser-known counterparts from all over the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven statue in bonn the annual beethoven festival in bonn is recognised as a platform for international talent to both display their skills and glimpse various interpretations of the great german composer , whose works have made for a lively heritage that continually inspire musicians .
along these lines , this year ’ s international beethoven festival which kicked off on september 6 – apart from numerous compositions by beethoven – focuses on the premieres of works composed by five significant contemporary composers , who have immersed themselves in beethoven ’ s works and spirit .
among them are french composer pascal dusapin , german composers jürg baur and manfred trojahn and spanish composer mauricio sotelo .
beethoven resounds from unlikely regions apart from guest performances by acclaimed orchestras , solo acts by virtuoso artists and chamber music ensembles , a special highlight of the festival is the " orchestra campus " project organised by the beethoven festival together with germany ’ s international broadcaster , deutsche welle .
the aim of the project is to invite a talented young orchestra from a country that has no obvious link with ludwig van beethoven to present their interpretation of beethoven ’ s works .
in return , the predominantly-german audience gets to enjoy the interpretation skills and creative potential of young talent from foreign regions .
though it ’ s difficult to think of turkey as a centre for western classical music , few are aware that the majority muslim country has dozens of music schools , conservatories and symphony orchestras based on european models .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish orchestra this year 80 young talented musicians from the state conservatory of the university of istanbul -lrb- photo -rrb- under the direction of rmiz malik aslanov have made their way to their rhine to show off their skills and get the chance to work with some prominent composers in bonn .
chance in a lifetime for turkish musicians thomas daniel scheel , the director of the beethoven festival is enthused about the orchestra campus project .
" such projects form a special part of a music festival .
the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul - which is wonderfully prepared under maestro malik aslanov – will not just present a finished programme , but we want to use the presence of these young people to give them an impression of the beethoven festival and a few important interpretations that they can take back with them to their own country " , he told dw-radio .
the young turkish musicians , who gave a performance on sunday evening , will also work together with prominent conductors such as krysztof penderecki , helmuth rilling and peter gülke who will take them through the paces in some of beethoven ’ s works as well as other composers .
the results of the co-operative efforts will be visible for all in the form of public workshop concerts .
robust cultural exchange the young musicians , who are staying with families in bonn , attend concerts , make contacts , and generally contribute to the international flair of the festival by participating in a vigorous cultural exchange between the orient and the occident .
naturally the young musicians from istanbul are excited about playing in germany and can hardly wait to meet up with the famous conductors .
beste karajedsin , who plays the clarinet said , " it ’ s very exciting for me to be together with such great personalities , to be allowed to work with them , to be in the same city , to move in the same spheres and to breathe the same air .

for an entire month , the city and the neighbouring region sway to the lilt of famous sonatas and uplifting compositions by the maestro himself as well as compositions and interpretations of his music by both renowned contemporary musicians and their lesser-known counterparts from all over the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven statue in bonn the annual beethoven festival in bonn is recognised as a platform for international talent to both display their skills and glimpse various interpretations of the great german composer , whose works have made for a lively heritage that continually inspire musicians .
along these lines , this year ’ s international beethoven festival which kicked off on september 6 – apart from numerous compositions by beethoven – focuses on the premieres of works composed by five significant contemporary composers , who have immersed themselves in beethoven ’ s works and spirit .
among them are french composer pascal dusapin , german composers jürg baur and manfred trojahn and spanish composer mauricio sotelo .
beethoven resounds from unlikely regions apart from guest performances by acclaimed orchestras , solo acts by virtuoso artists and chamber music ensembles , a special highlight of the festival is the " orchestra campus " project organised by the beethoven festival together with germany ’ s international broadcaster , deutsche welle .
the aim of the project is to invite a talented young orchestra from a country that has no obvious link with ludwig van beethoven to present their interpretation of beethoven ’ s works .
in return , the predominantly-german audience gets to enjoy the interpretation skills and creative potential of young talent from foreign regions .
though it ’ s difficult to think of turkey as a centre for western classical music , few are aware that the majority muslim country has dozens of music schools , conservatories and symphony orchestras based on european models .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish orchestra this year 80 young talented musicians from the state conservatory of the university of istanbul -lrb- photo -rrb- under the direction of rmiz malik aslanov have made their way to their rhine to show off their skills and get the chance to work with some prominent composers in bonn .
chance in a lifetime for turkish musicians thomas daniel scheel , the director of the beethoven festival is enthused about the orchestra campus project .
" such projects form a special part of a music festival .
the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul - which is wonderfully prepared under maestro malik aslanov – will not just present a finished programme , but we want to use the presence of these young people to give them an impression of the beethoven festival and a few important interpretations that they can take back with them to their own country " , he told dw-radio .
the young turkish musicians , who gave a performance on sunday evening , will also work together with prominent conductors such as krysztof penderecki , helmuth rilling and peter gülke who will take them through the paces in some of beethoven ’ s works as well as other composers .
the results of the co-operative efforts will be visible for all in the form of public workshop concerts .
robust cultural exchange the young musicians , who are staying with families in bonn , attend concerts , make contacts , and generally contribute to the international flair of the festival by participating in a vigorous cultural exchange between the orient and the occident .
naturally the young musicians from istanbul are excited about playing in germany and can hardly wait to meet up with the famous conductors .
beste karajedsin , who plays the clarinet said , " it ’ s very exciting for me to be together with such great personalities , to be allowed to work with them , to be in the same city , to move in the same spheres and to breathe the same air .
it ’ s wonderful " .
beethoven as inspiration an integral part of the orchestra campus project is the deutsche welle prize for best composer which is awarded to an outstanding composer from the guest country .
this time turkish composer özkan manav -lrb- photo -rrb- won the award for his work entitled " portamento lento " which was performed by the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul on sunday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer özkan manav a thrilled manav told dw-radio that he discovered how " close " he felt to beethoven ’ s music when he began composing his award-wining work and how much it " motivated " and " moved " him .
" even today as a composer and music teacher , i consider beethoven one of the heroes of classical music .
in that sense , it ’ s naturally wonderful to be in the same city that beethoven was born in .
and i ’ m really proud of the fact that my work was premiered in a hall that bears the name of beethoven ! " , he said .

the aim of the project is to invite a talented young orchestra from a country that has no obvious link with ludwig van beethoven to present their interpretation of beethoven ’ s works .
in return , the predominantly-german audience gets to enjoy the interpretation skills and creative potential of young talent from foreign regions .
though it ’ s difficult to think of turkey as a centre for western classical music , few are aware that the majority muslim country has dozens of music schools , conservatories and symphony orchestras based on european models .

chance in a lifetime for turkish musicians thomas daniel scheel , the director of the beethoven festival is enthused about the orchestra campus project .
" such projects form a special part of a music festival .
the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul - which is wonderfully prepared under maestro malik aslanov – will not just present a finished programme , but we want to use the presence of these young people to give them an impression of the beethoven festival and a few important interpretations that they can take back with them to their own country " , he told dw-radio .
the young turkish musicians , who gave a performance on sunday evening , will also work together with prominent conductors such as krysztof penderecki , helmuth rilling and peter gülke who will take them through the paces in some of beethoven ’ s works as well as other composers .
the results of the co-operative efforts will be visible for all in the form of public workshop concerts .
robust cultural exchange the young musicians , who are staying with families in bonn , attend concerts , make contacts , and generally contribute to the international flair of the festival by participating in a vigorous cultural exchange between the orient and the occident .
naturally the young musicians from istanbul are excited about playing in germany and can hardly wait to meet up with the famous conductors .
beste karajedsin , who plays the clarinet said , " it ’ s very exciting for me to be together with such great personalities , to be allowed to work with them , to be in the same city , to move in the same spheres and to breathe the same air .
it ’ s wonderful " .
beethoven as inspiration an integral part of the orchestra campus project is the deutsche welle prize for best composer which is awarded to an outstanding composer from the guest country .
this time turkish composer özkan manav -lrb- photo -rrb- won the award for his work entitled " portamento lento " which was performed by the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul on sunday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer özkan manav a thrilled manav told dw-radio that he discovered how " close " he felt to beethoven ’ s music when he began composing his award-wining work and how much it " motivated " and " moved " him .
" even today as a composer and music teacher , i consider beethoven one of the heroes of classical music .
in that sense , it ’ s naturally wonderful to be in the same city that beethoven was born in .

for an entire month , the city and the neighbouring region sway to the lilt of famous sonatas and uplifting compositions by the maestro himself as well as compositions and interpretations of his music by both renowned contemporary musicians and their lesser-known counterparts from all over the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven statue in bonn the annual beethoven festival in bonn is recognised as a platform for international talent to both display their skills and glimpse various interpretations of the great german composer , whose works have made for a lively heritage that continually inspire musicians .
along these lines , this year ’ s international beethoven festival which kicked off on september 6 – apart from numerous compositions by beethoven – focuses on the premieres of works composed by five significant contemporary composers , who have immersed themselves in beethoven ’ s works and spirit .
among them are french composer pascal dusapin , german composers jürg baur and manfred trojahn and spanish composer mauricio sotelo .
beethoven resounds from unlikely regions apart from guest performances by acclaimed orchestras , solo acts by virtuoso artists and chamber music ensembles , a special highlight of the festival is the " orchestra campus " project organised by the beethoven festival together with germany ’ s international broadcaster , deutsche welle .
the aim of the project is to invite a talented young orchestra from a country that has no obvious link with ludwig van beethoven to present their interpretation of beethoven ’ s works .
in return , the predominantly-german audience gets to enjoy the interpretation skills and creative potential of young talent from foreign regions .
though it ’ s difficult to think of turkey as a centre for western classical music , few are aware that the majority muslim country has dozens of music schools , conservatories and symphony orchestras based on european models .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish orchestra this year 80 young talented musicians from the state conservatory of the university of istanbul -lrb- photo -rrb- under the direction of rmiz malik aslanov have made their way to their rhine to show off their skills and get the chance to work with some prominent composers in bonn .
chance in a lifetime for turkish musicians thomas daniel scheel , the director of the beethoven festival is enthused about the orchestra campus project .
" such projects form a special part of a music festival .
the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul - which is wonderfully prepared under maestro malik aslanov – will not just present a finished programme , but we want to use the presence of these young people to give them an impression of the beethoven festival and a few important interpretations that they can take back with them to their own country " , he told dw-radio .
the young turkish musicians , who gave a performance on sunday evening , will also work together with prominent conductors such as krysztof penderecki , helmuth rilling and peter gülke who will take them through the paces in some of beethoven ’ s works as well as other composers .
the results of the co-operative efforts will be visible for all in the form of public workshop concerts .
robust cultural exchange the young musicians , who are staying with families in bonn , attend concerts , make contacts , and generally contribute to the international flair of the festival by participating in a vigorous cultural exchange between the orient and the occident .
naturally the young musicians from istanbul are excited about playing in germany and can hardly wait to meet up with the famous conductors .
beste karajedsin , who plays the clarinet said , " it ’ s very exciting for me to be together with such great personalities , to be allowed to work with them , to be in the same city , to move in the same spheres and to breathe the same air .
it ’ s wonderful " .

for an entire month , the city and the neighbouring region sway to the lilt of famous sonatas and uplifting compositions by the maestro himself as well as compositions and interpretations of his music by both renowned contemporary musicians and their lesser-known counterparts from all over the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven statue in bonn the annual beethoven festival in bonn is recognised as a platform for international talent to both display their skills and glimpse various interpretations of the great german composer , whose works have made for a lively heritage that continually inspire musicians .
along these lines , this year ’ s international beethoven festival which kicked off on september 6 – apart from numerous compositions by beethoven – focuses on the premieres of works composed by five significant contemporary composers , who have immersed themselves in beethoven ’ s works and spirit .
among them are french composer pascal dusapin , german composers jürg baur and manfred trojahn and spanish composer mauricio sotelo .
beethoven resounds from unlikely regions apart from guest performances by acclaimed orchestras , solo acts by virtuoso artists and chamber music ensembles , a special highlight of the festival is the " orchestra campus " project organised by the beethoven festival together with germany ’ s international broadcaster , deutsche welle .
the aim of the project is to invite a talented young orchestra from a country that has no obvious link with ludwig van beethoven to present their interpretation of beethoven ’ s works .
in return , the predominantly-german audience gets to enjoy the interpretation skills and creative potential of young talent from foreign regions .
though it ’ s difficult to think of turkey as a centre for western classical music , few are aware that the majority muslim country has dozens of music schools , conservatories and symphony orchestras based on european models .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish orchestra this year 80 young talented musicians from the state conservatory of the university of istanbul -lrb- photo -rrb- under the direction of rmiz malik aslanov have made their way to their rhine to show off their skills and get the chance to work with some prominent composers in bonn .
chance in a lifetime for turkish musicians thomas daniel scheel , the director of the beethoven festival is enthused about the orchestra campus project .
" such projects form a special part of a music festival .
the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul - which is wonderfully prepared under maestro malik aslanov – will not just present a finished programme , but we want to use the presence of these young people to give them an impression of the beethoven festival and a few important interpretations that they can take back with them to their own country " , he told dw-radio .
the young turkish musicians , who gave a performance on sunday evening , will also work together with prominent conductors such as krysztof penderecki , helmuth rilling and peter gülke who will take them through the paces in some of beethoven ’ s works as well as other composers .
the results of the co-operative efforts will be visible for all in the form of public workshop concerts .
robust cultural exchange the young musicians , who are staying with families in bonn , attend concerts , make contacts , and generally contribute to the international flair of the festival by participating in a vigorous cultural exchange between the orient and the occident .
naturally the young musicians from istanbul are excited about playing in germany and can hardly wait to meet up with the famous conductors .
beste karajedsin , who plays the clarinet said , " it ’ s very exciting for me to be together with such great personalities , to be allowed to work with them , to be in the same city , to move in the same spheres and to breathe the same air .
it ’ s wonderful " .
beethoven as inspiration an integral part of the orchestra campus project is the deutsche welle prize for best composer which is awarded to an outstanding composer from the guest country .
this time turkish composer özkan manav -lrb- photo -rrb- won the award for his work entitled " portamento lento " which was performed by the orchestra of the conservatory of the university of istanbul on sunday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer özkan manav a thrilled manav told dw-radio that he discovered how " close " he felt to beethoven ’ s music when he began composing his award-wining work and how much it " motivated " and " moved " him .
" even today as a composer and music teacher , i consider beethoven one of the heroes of classical music .
in that sense , it ’ s naturally wonderful to be in the same city that beethoven was born in .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- breakfast -pipe- landfill sites may take hazardous waste news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : programmes : breakfast news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk monday , 16 september , 2002 , 05:35 gmt 06:35 uk landfill sites may take hazardous waste more than 200 landfill sites across england and wales have been earmarked to take hazardous waste .
it 's thought that the environment agency will announce later today the locations of the sites , which will be given permission to handle hazardous waste .
breakfast 's max foster said in his report : hazardous chemical waste includes everything from clinical waste to asbestos and oil ... its usually mixed up with household rubbish and dumped in a landfill site .
from 2004 , though new european rules mean that hazardous waste has to go to a hazardous-only site ... more than two hundred such sites have now been approved .
a full list will be published by the environment agency this afternoon ... when one group of neighbours was told their local site was on the list , they said they would take the decision to the courts ... the fear is dangerous chemicals will seep into groundwater or pollute the air ... but the environment agency says its checked the sites and there 's no need to worry click here to watch more on the story with max max foster was live on breakfast at the pilsworth north landfill site , in bury lancashire .
landfill sites : there are more 1000 landfill sites in england and wales all sites were given the option of whether to take more hazardous waste 222 took the option to take more hazardous waste the environment agency says the changes will mean all landfill sites across the eu are classified in the same way campaigners say the hazardous waste , which includes clinical and medical waste , oil and asbestos can cause birth defects , irritation to the skin and eyes and can be carried along to nearby neighbourhoods on the wind .
can landfills cause harm ? jury is still out on whether landfill sites with hazardous materials can harm unborn children or other harm. according to one study published in the lancet at the end of january 2002 the risk of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality such as down 's syndrome increased by 40 % for women who lived within two miles of toxic landfill sites .
the study - which looked at 23 sites in britain , denmark , france , belgium and italy - was criticised though by one expert who said it was unclear if the children had down 's because the mother lived near a toxic landfill or whether it was some other factor .
12 of the landfill sites were in britain .
background on legislation : the landfill directive sets out a range of controls which must be applied to both new and existing landfill sites .
whilst many of the directive 's requirements reflect those already in place in britain under the waste management licensing regime , it will nevertheless introduce some key changes to current landfill practice , including : 1 -rrb- the separation of landfills into three types : for only hazardous , non hazardous or inert waste - this will end the current uk practice of co-disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste by 2004 .
2 -rrb- the requirement to treat most wastes before landfill .
3 -rrb- bans on the disposal of certain wastes going to landfill for disposal including liquid wastes , certain hazardous wastes , and tyres .
4 -rrb- introduction of waste acceptance criteria setting out the types of waste that can be accepted at each of the three types of landfill .
together these requirements will represent a major challenge to both landfill operators and waste producers who currently dispose of waste to landfill .

the owners of the doune dining room on the knoydart peninsula have decided to retire and have put the restaurant on the market for £ 300,000 .
alan and mary robinson converted a derelict crofting cottage at the west coast location into a restaurant 20 years ago .
it has gained a reputation since then as one of scotland 's leading restaurants .
the restaurant comes with three bedrooms , two adjacent plots of land , a powerboat and views of the isle of skye .
a self-catering lodge next door will continue to be run by the robinsons ' business partners , andy and liz tibbetts .
mrs robinson , 64 , said : " we 're in our mid-60s and we feel it 's time for new blood to come in so that the business does n't become too much for the other partners . "
the couple , who previously owned a shipbuilding business , moved to scotland from cornwall in 1982 after spotting the cottage from their yacht while sailing off the west coast of scotland .
' make or break ' their two children , jamie and toby , who were 12 and 11 at the time , have since settled on the peninsula and started families of their own .
mrs robinson said : " it 's the remote situation which is the make or the break of it .
" whoever came in would have to love the place and want to live here .
" we are only accessible by sea , you ca n't drive here at all .
there is a public road but that does n't come down here . "
mrs tibbetts told bbc news online that some potential buyers have come forward .

annie may carter died 11 days after having a second operation to remove the knee joint which had been mistakenly inserted into her leg at prince charles hospital in merthyr .
an investigation by a consultant from the royal college of surgeons -lrb- rcs -rrb- revealed that human error had led to a right-knee joint being used instead of a left one .
mrs carter , 59 , suffered from angina .
there is no evidence linking her death with the surgery .
operations postponed as a result of the human error conclusion , the hospital was given the all-clear to resume emergency orthopaedic surgery .
but non-urgent operations will not be booked for another two weeks .
mrs carter died after suffering three heart attacks about 40 planned orthopaedic operations at the hospital have been postponed during the suspension with a further 80 in the pipeline pushed back .
the hospital has now instigated new procedures to try and stop such a mistake happening again , including an immediate update of storage and stocking methods .
an rcs consultant also commented on the need for clearer labelling of prostheses , a point the hospital 's governing nhs trust said it would take up with the manufacturers , as this would help orthopaedic teams throughout the health service .
the hospital 's medical director , dr terence morris , said on wednesday : " i was pleased to be advised that this orthopaedic team can resume operating duties at prince charles hospital .
around 120 operations have been affected " there remains a problem with overall staffing levels due to vacancies and leave and , as a consequence , patients will not be booked for planned operations for another two weeks although the position will be kept under continual review .
an inquest last week into the death of mrs carter , from gurnos , merthyr tydfil , was adjourned until further investigations are completed . watch / listen on this story bbc wales ' melanie doel " first staff did n't read the box containing the parts and then they failed to follow a verbal checking procedure .

the burning italian-flagged vessel is in danger of breaking up and spilling more oil near the protected saint lucia wetlands park .
the vessel is not going to last the two weeks it will take us to control the fire , so we will make an attempt to refloat her nicholas sloane , salvage master smit salvage made an unsuccessful bid to put out the fire , which broke out on tuesday , crippling the vessel and forcing the crew to abandon ship .

" the vessel is not going to last the two weeks it will take us to control the fire , so we will make an attempt to refloat her , " salvage master nicholas sloane said .
race against time environmentalists are concerned that efforts to pull the boat from the beach could break open the weakened hull , pouring 1,300 tonnes of petrol into the sea .
rescue workers have so far managed to keep the oil slick away from the protected area , conservationists said .
the public has been warned to stay out of the area oil-absorbent booms were placed across the mouth of the umfolozi river , and bulldozers added man-made dunes to a sand bar that protects the mangrove swamp .
the jolly rubino ran aground about 11 kilometres -lrb- seven miles -rrb- south of the unesco-recognised wetlands .

yet in the hugely popular online game everquest , many players are eagerly taking their chance to kill such a fearsome beast .
they are so keen to fight because before now they have had a wait of months for a chance to kill the dragon and complete a key stage of their in-game character 's development .
everquest creator verant made changes to clear the bottleneck causing the long delays , but some fear the alterations will unbalance the game .
stolen glory in everquest players control characters that grow in skill at a particular profession , such as warrior , thief or priest , by completing quests during which they gather booty and kill monsters .
when they are powerful enough , every profession can complete an epic quest which rewards them with a powerful magical artefact .
these items can not be passed on to other characters or sold .
the only way to get them is by completing the quest .
the epic quest of everquest 's clerics , priests and healers , demanded the killing of a powerful red dragon called ragefire .
ragefire appeared between two and six days of real time after its human form was killed .
the timer was re-set every time the everquest servers were shut down for maintenance .
this delay , and the fact that only one group could take him on at any time , forced some players to wait months for their chance to kill him .
the bottleneck led to some unsporting play by some groups , or guilds .
one player who suffered more than most was dale graham from florida who controls a powerful cleric called seyiyes .
mr graham sat in front of his computer for days waiting for ragefire to turn up , only to have his guild 's chance to kill it snatched away by another group called silent resurgence .
" it really hurt our entire guild , " mr graham told bbc news online .
" we have lost many members . "
" i have played very little in the last two weeks , " he said , " a lot of it is because of loss of respect and love for the game . "
rule breaker the practice of barging in and taking someone else 's chance to deal a monster a mortal blow is called " kill-stealing " and is banned under everquest 's terms and conditions .
now verant has changed the method of triggering the dragon form of ragefire which means it appears much more often .
the result has been lots of clerics completing their epic quest much faster than they otherwise have done .
the change has been widely praised on many everquest discussion groups because it removes the bottleneck but remains as challenging because good teamwork is needed to complete the new part of the quest .
others fear that the proliferation of powerful magical items the changes will cause could make some parts of the game too easy .
mr graham has been told that verant is investigating the " kill-stealing " incident he suffered and that action could be taken against silent resurgence if they are found to have broken the game 's rules .

that was the challenge facing the cashing in team .
moira and adam make a new friend moira , adam and a small army of the country 's leading independent financial advisors and tax and mortgage experts pitched up in the city centre to guide people through the money maze and tell them how to make the most of their hard earned cash .
eight hours later the team had a surprise in store .
adam says : as a nation we waste a staggering £ 19 billion through poor financial housekeeping .
we 're mad with our money .
we trust lenders who charge too much and invest with banks that pay too little .
we lose our heads when it comes to investing .
millions of people put their money in bank accounts with appallingly low interest rates .
you can easily get 20 times more interest by just moving your money around .
we have mortgages with lenders who are n't competitive and we do n't make use of the tax breaks available to us .
cashing in is on a mission to change all that .
three simple steps to save money : do n't let your mortgage lender get away with it park your money in an isa do n't over tax yourself - check your tax code pat bunton re-mortgaging we 've borrowed £ 590,985 million in mortgages .
according to research done for cashing in by pat bunton from london & country mortgages , around 30 % of us are on a variable rate with no redemption penalties .
the average rate we pay on our mortgage is 5.4 % .
in fact many of us are paying much more than this .
but working on this assumption , the average mortgage holder could reduce their monthly payments by 36 % saving more than £ 1,000 a year - and many people could save a lot more than that .
anna bowes cash isas a cash isa is a gift , so it 's hard to see why most people who pay tax and have some savings do n't rush out now and get one .
if you 've got extra cash in your cheque account you are likely to be earning around 0.2 % interest a year .
returns like that have all the excitement of an old banger .
you can easily turbo charge your savings by getting as much as 20 times the amount offered by some of the main high street banks ' current accounts .
if everyone who does n't have a cash isa took one out we could save a huge amount of tax .
anna bowes from chase de vere says : " while individually this sum is small , by protecting £ 3,000 each from the taxman , investors could collectively save nearly £ 222 million . "
john whiting tax and how to pay less of it if you want to save more - pay less tax .
it 's easier than you think .
thousands of us are thought to have the wrong tax code and as a result have more tax deducted from our salary than necessary .
john whiting , tax partner at pricewaterhousecoopers , says : " if you check your tax code and find that they have n't given you your age allowance , a quick call to the inland revenue can save you £ 320 a year .
and there are millions more ways of saving tax by taking some time planning your finances . "

and weak demand for air travel is expected to persist into next year , the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- has warned at its annual outlook conference in madrid , spain .
the industry 's losses are likely to be concentrated on international flights to and from north america , where the aviation market has been devastated by an economic downturn , plus the impact of the 11 september terror attacks last year .
this year 's forecast compares with losses of $ 12 billion -lrb- £ 7.7 billion -rrb- in 2001 .
' painful adjustment ' in europe , british airways is expected to make a pre-tax loss of £ 20m this year .
but a few of the bigger continental airlines like air france , iberia and lufthansa , which are less dependent on transatlantic travel , look set to remain profitable .
us airlines continue to suffer from a huge drop in business , with revenues 25 % down on the previous year .
they are still going through a " painful adjustment of capacity to weak demand " says iata 's chief economist peter morris .
" the cost picture is bleak , " he adds , with fuel and security prices rising , while fares have been slashed .
the only way to keep flying is to cut other costs , such as jobs and capacity .
asia leads recovery in the longer term , full service carriers are worried that key corporate customers are changing their corporate travel policies , flying less and in cheaper seats or switching to low cost airlines .
the best outlook is in the asia pacific region , where airlines which suffered bad times in the late 1990s have retrenched and are now doing relatively well .
iata expects some global improvement in 2003 , with around 5 % growth in traffic and capacity , and a profits forecast of $ 2 billion -lrb- £ 1.3 billion -rrb- on international routes .
but those figures depend heavily on economic growth and corporate recovery .
if the world economy does n't pick up , the pessimistic forecast is that international flights could still be losing money at the end of next year .

the movie , about abuse in irish catholic church-run asylums , was given the toronto discovery award for first or second-time directors voted for by about 750 journalists .
directed by scot peter mullan , it was attacked by the catholic hierarchy after winning the golden lion at the venice film festival for giving what the church says is a false picture of events .
a new zealand film about a maori child trying to find her place in her male-dominated tribe collected the people 's choice award as the festival came to a close .
niki caro 's the whale rider beat more than 300 films shown over 10 days to win the prize , which has previously gone to american beauty and crouching tiger , hidden dragon .
this year 's festival was changed to reflect the anniversary of the 11 september attacks .
last year 's event was brought to a temporary halt as the tragedies unfolded and this year screenings and press conferences were put on hold on the anniversary as a mark of respect .
national flavour although the toronto film festival does not hold as much weight as cannes or venice there was a large contingent of hollywood stars in attendance .
michael douglas , kiefer sutherland , denzel washington , ralph fiennes , sophia loren and antonio banderas were just some of the names in town to promote films .
the festival keeps a strong national flavour with a clutch of awards being handed out to canadian films .
director david cronenberg won award for best film by a canadian film for spiders .
many had expected atom egoyan 's ararat , which opened the festival , to take the prize , which comes with a cheque for c $ 25,000 -lrb- £ 10,239 -rrb- .
" it totally caught me by surprise . ...
i 've never won anything from the toronto festival before , " cronenberg said .
" i 've won awards in several other places like cannes and so on , but it 's a very special feeling when it 's here .
there 's a real warmth . "
cronenberg , whose previous pictures include naked lunch and crash , said he hoped the award would encourage people to go and see the film .
the magdalene sisters ran into controversy when it won the top prize at the 2002 venice film festival .
british success set in the 1960s , the film tells the story of one of the magdalene convents , which were run on behalf of the catholic church , and the abuse suffered by young girls during their stay .
vatican newspaper l 'osservatore romano said the movie is an " angry and rancorous provocation " , while vatican radio condemned it as " clearly false " .
distributor miramax defended the film , saying it was designed to address the touchy issue of the treatment of young women in the era .
mullan himself has said the church should face up to its past and the cruelty dished out by irish nuns .

the movie , about abuse in irish catholic church-run asylums , was given the toronto discovery award for first or second-time directors voted for by about 750 journalists .
directed by scot peter mullan , it was attacked by the catholic hierarchy after winning the golden lion at the venice film festival for giving what the church says is a false picture of events .
a new zealand film about a maori child trying to find her place in her male-dominated tribe collected the people 's choice award as the festival came to a close .
cronenberg was delighted to win the best canadian film award niki caro 's the whale rider beat more than 300 films shown over 10 days to win the prize , which has previously gone to american beauty and crouching tiger , hidden dragon .
this year 's festival was changed to reflect the anniversary of the 11 september attacks .
last year 's event was brought to a temporary halt as the tragedies unfolded and this year screenings and press conferences were put on hold on the anniversary as a mark of respect .
national flavour although the toronto film festival does not hold as much weight as cannes or venice there was a large contingent of hollywood stars in attendance .
michael douglas , kiefer sutherland , denzel washington , ralph fiennes , sophia loren and antonio banderas were just some of the names in town to promote films .
the festival keeps a strong national flavour with a clutch of awards being handed out to canadian films .
director david cronenberg won award for best film by a canadian film for spiders .
many had expected atom egoyan 's ararat , which opened the festival , to take the prize , which comes with a cheque for c $ 25,000 -lrb- £ 10,239 -rrb- .
" it totally caught me by surprise . ...
i 've never won anything from the toronto festival before , " cronenberg said .
" i 've won awards in several other places like cannes and so on , but it 's a very special feeling when it 's here .
there 's a real warmth . " 24 star kiefer sutherland was in toronto to promote his movie phone booth cronenberg , whose previous pictures include naked lunch and crash , said he hoped the award would encourage people to go and see the film .
the magdalene sisters ran into controversy when it won the top prize at the 2002 venice film festival .
british success set in the 1960s , the film tells the story of one of the magdalene convents , which were run on behalf of the catholic church , and the abuse suffered by young girls during their stay .
vatican newspaper l 'osservatore romano said the movie is an " angry and rancorous provocation " , while vatican radio condemned it as " clearly false " .
distributor miramax defended the film , saying it was designed to address the touchy issue of the treatment of young women in the era .
mullan himself has said the church should face up to its past and the cruelty dished out by irish nuns .

there are enormous opportunities in this country , because so many things need to be done mohammed khatiri five months ago he returned to the country he left as a child in 1970 , to run a local building renovation business he had acquired with his brother .
he has had to get used to more red tape than he was accustomed to in france : " i spent two months going from office to office , registering the company 's change of ownership , " he says .
he found face-to-face relationships mattered in dealings with government departments : " you have to know whose door to knock on . "
khatiri 's views are shared by other emigrants and he says doubts about the ability of the courts to solve disputes in the last instance translate into a cautious business environment .
moroccan banks are only slowly coming to understand the needs of medium-sized businesses , according to khatiri and other would-be investors .
with inflation low , interest-rates on loans seem high .
a different generation khatiri was only three when he emigrated to france , where his father found work in clothes manufacturing .
like other emigrants , he thinks a gust of fresh air is needed in business practices in the old country , with a new management style and greater meritocracy .
banks advertise for emigrants ' deposits but he adds : " there are enormous opportunities in this country , because so many things need to be done . "
some of his gripes echo those of investors surveyed by the american chamber of commerce in casablanca earlier this year , and also complaints voiced during a discussion at a recent trade fair here for emigrant investors .
" we are not like our parents ' generation , " said one discussion participant .
" they had n't studied and did n't know their rights .
they would write out cheques to send money home and that was it . "
welcome home in pushing for change , the emigrants appear to have morocco 's top decision-makers on their side .
the administration wants to oversee " a radical change not just in procedures but also in the whole ethos " of official dealings with business , says abdesslam el ftouh , of the government-funded hassan ii foundation for moroccans resident abroad .
until now , the ethos has been , ' i 'm making money ' jamal belahrach the flagship for this drive to streamline procedures is a ' one-stop ' bureau inaugurated this month in casablanca , where paperwork for start-ups can be completed in one go .
crucially , its director has a private-sector background .
the euro-moroccan community of some 2.5 million people lives mainly in france , holland , belgium , spain , italy and germany - in that order .
each summer about a million are in the media spotlight as they trek down through europe to spend the holidays in morocco .
official television slots tell them : " you are at home .
welcome to your country . "
and government-funded reception centres near the main ports ease their journeys .
catalyst for change the effort to make the emigrants feel wanted is not surprising .
funds sent home by moroccans working abroad are the country 's main source of foreign currency , outstripping earnings from tourism and phosphates .
the government might have to try harder to lure emigrants home last year , ahead of the introduction of the euro , the amount sent home surged more than 50 % to $ 3.5bn -lrb- £ 2.3bn ; 36.1 billion dirham -rrb- .
local banks vie for deposits and offer special terms on home loans .
about 80 % of remittances still go towards buying residential property .
jamal belahrach , who returned to casablanca from europe five years ago to direct the north african operations of recruitment agency manpower , believes euro-moroccans will be a catalyst for change .
a timeless rural way of life suddenly has a starting-point for modernisation abdesslam el ftouh they are making common cause with younger moroccan business people who are already abandoning the low-risk mentality that held sway for decades , says belahrach , whose father moved to france to become a building worker .
and there is a greater understanding that growth requires more spending power , and improved health and education , for the wider population , he says .
" until now , the ethos has been , ' i 'm making money " ' , he says .
" this needs to change to an ethos of ' i 'm creating wealth ' - in which case one needs to learn to distribute wealth among clients , shareholders , employees , the environment even . "
timeless way of life meanwhile in far-flung moroccan villages the modest savings accumulated by most migrant workers already give a spontaneous kick-start to local economies , says el ftouh .
even home improvements have a significant knock-on effect , through the demand created for plumbers and bathroom furniture suppliers , for example .
" a timeless rural way of life suddenly has a starting-point for modernisation , " he says .
but the government might have to work harder to prevent migrants staying in europe rather than returning home with their money .
moroccan elections are being held at the end of september and many emigrants are unhappy that do not have the right to vote in the country that says it is so keen to welcome them home .

their national suicide prevention strategy for england , published on monday , is part of the government 's aim to reduce the suicide rate by at least 20 % by 2010 . "
the first thing is to try to reduce suicides in those groups in society in which rates are high " professor louis appleby , national director for mental health it particularly wants to reach the 50 % of people who commit suicide who have had no contact with psychiatric health services .
one person kills themself in england every two hours , and suicide is the most common cause of death among men under the age of 35 .
the document aims to raise awareness of potential warning signals which friends , family and other healthcare professionals should look out for .
it sets out several measures including : reducing the availability and lethality of suicidal methods improving the reporting of suicidal behaviours in the media promoting research on suicide prevention promoting mental well-being in the wider population reducing suicide risk amongst high-risk groups , such as young men some measures to reduce suicides have already been taken , including cutting the number of pills sold in paracetamol packs .
the number of deaths related to the painkiller fell 10 % between 1998 and 1999 after the move .
launching the strategy , health minister jacqui smith said : " there is no single route or quick fix to reducing suicide .
" there are many different reasons why someone decides to take their own life .
" in order to successfully implement this strategy we will be working in partnership with a wide range of organisations and individuals .
" this is not a one-off document and we intend it to be an evolving strategy that will develop in light of progress made and emerging evidence of good practice . "
high risk professor louis appleby , national director for mental health , told the bbc : " the first thing is to try to reduce suicides in those groups in society in which rates are high , such as people with mental illness . "
he said there also needed to be improvements in the follow-up care of people at risk of suicide who had come to the attention of other areas such as drug and alcohol abuse services .
professor appleby added : " we want to talk to primary care authorities about better ways of identifying high risk people in the same way that can happen now for people at a high risk of cardiovascular disease . "
but he said : " the group who most often do n't have contact with anybody before they commit suicide are young men .
" they quite often do n't look after their health very well , and they do carry high risk factors for suicide , such as drug misuse , and being unemployed or living alone .
" and the kind of young men who commit suicide often have quite turbulent past histories . "
professor appleby said he wanted to improve services so young men who attend a & e after an overdose , or attend drug and alcohol services , would be better assessed and more closely followed up .
' on course ' the government will also commission a review of evidence worldwide on how young men can be reached using health promotional messages .
this will then be used to develop a pilot project to reach young men with messages for young men on how they can look after their mental health which , if successful , will be rolled out nationally .
he said the government was on course to reach its target of reducing suicides by 20 % by 2010 .
" since 1997 , the annual rate initially rose but for the last two years has actually fallen .
and he said if the trend continued at the same rate , the government would be " pretty near " its target .
richard brook , chief executive of the mental health charity mind , said : " the problem with the suicide strategy is while its good at looking at risk , it 's not good at delivering services .
" there will not be the services for very vulnerable groups , particularly young men . "
jackie wilkinson , of the samaritans , said the government 's targets were acheivable provided they were backed up by sufficient funding and commitment .
marjorie wallace , of the charity sane , said : " it is not just in prison and hospital that people are taking their lives - far too many are doing so in the first few days and weeks after discharge from hospital when they are most at risk .
" too many severely ill and depressed people are left unsupported and isolated in the community , with no form of follow-up or consistent care and nowhere to turn . "

it has since gone on to play host to the biggest names , as well as some of the strangest and most memorable moments in pop history .
notable moments include dexy 's midnight runners ' performance of jackie wilson said in 1982 , when their tribute to the soul legend came under threat of being misinterpreted by a giant picture of british darts player jocky wilson on the screen behind them .
all about eve 's silent performance , rod stewart 's footballs and nirvana 's stage invasion have also provided some of the show 's high and low points .
what is your favourite top of the pops memory ?
who gave the best - or worst - performance over the 2,000 programmes ?
do you think the show is still as relevant as ever ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
totp is only as good as the music it plays .
unfortunately the great british public is currently fond of those awful mime artists who do nothing but prance all over the set .
1975 to 1985 was the golden era .
anthony jarvis , uk madonna strutting around in that pink wig singing like a virgin with her innovative belly button flashing .
they 're all doing it now and so is she with two kids and a stomach to die for .
she is the queen of woman cool .
pearlie , uk not a teenager in the land could forget that great feeling of loving something that your parents hated .
totp was always there for that .
dave , uk shame about all the teeny bands and their dodgy 80 's covers paul , uk top of the pops is still the tops , shame about all the teeny bands and their dodgy 80 's covers -lrb- although the original 80 's music was excellent -rrb- .
the music industry is more about a pretty face today .
paul , uk best memory of totp - the shocking red pouch of the cameo singer singing " word up " the bbc has loads of complaints - excellent .
the worst moment - happens every week now , when they go ' backstage ' into the green room and the bored , fed up artists are made to talk and clearly they just want to go home , they have plugged their latest and now want to leave , it makes you want to cringe .
of course we love to watch it now and remember our childhood , but we are now our parents " what a load of rubbish - look they ca n't even play instruments " - which of course is true nowadays .
bring back bands that can actually play and not some karaoke artists - i can do that !
sam bird , uk noddy holder trying to sing merry christmas everybody live while somebody was pushing a custard pie into his face .
all the performances in the glam 1971 to 1974 era .
sadly now totp is another tool of the music industry helping to prop up a very poor singles chart .
where has all the talent gone ?
mark perkins , uk it 's ironic that the theme music for the programme for so many years , a cover of whole lotta love , was written by led zeppelin who never appeared on the show .
-lrb- they never released a single in the uk but went on to become the biggest band of the 70 's worldwide , and still exert enormous influence -rrb- record companies take note ; try nurturing genuine talent instead of cynically marketing -lrb- seemingly to little girls -rrb- short term , no talent ' boy ' bands etc that now infest totp .
it 'll be better for your bank balances in the long run and would provide much better bands and songs for the charts - and totp !
richard thompson , uk i hate " top of the pops " .
it has never been about music , just egomaniacs who ca n't sing , mime to back up tapes , and silly dance routines and pop videos .
this is not music .
if you want music , please support the annual proms at the royal albert hall , and listen to classic fm .
as someone one is a competent amateur musician - i learned to play four musical instruments - i think i could do a better job than some of these pop parasites .
caroline , england i saw totp from day one .
too many favourites , but the who singing ' i can see for miles ' stands out , as does pan 's people dancing to ' all right now ' -lrb- free -rrb- , which was a dance to remember .
you ca n't beat the 1960s so i do n't watch it anymore .
even totp2 is really totp with an occasional oldie thrown in .
lawrence harris , uk maybe now tony blackburn is back in the public eye the beeb might bring him on to present it .
now would n't that be poptastic !
rob tribe , uk elvis costello singing " radio radio " and pointing at tony blackburn while singing " and the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools ... " while tony grinned inanely , not understanding .
declan mcmanus , australia -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- it must be the first time culture club came on singing ' do you really want to hurt me ' and my mother walked into the room .
" what does she think she looks like ? " she cried .
" it 's not a she , it 's a he " , i ventured .
she looked aghast , said " oh my god " and left the room .
at that moment i knew i was cutting edge and she was just an old person !
classic .
james hutton , japan , ex-pat debbie harry wearing only a bin liner pete , uk debbie harry singing atomic wearing only a bin liner - now that is a cherished memory !
pete , uk tenpole tudor jumping around the stage like an escaped lunatic , and clare grogan -lrb- altered image -rrb- who was every cameraman 's nightmare as she refused to keep still for more than a nanosecond .
paul hitchcock , hong kong duran duran - five beautiful new romantic english lads in all their garb and glory in the 80 's !
yum yum !
hair dye , lipstick and gloss , eyeliner and the best clothes .
nick and his synthesizer , john slappin ' that bass , andy twirling around , shy roger beating the drums and simon melting our hearts with his words .
those were the days ! ! !
kathleen , usa - ex-pat you really are old if you do n't like totp cathy mccart , n. ireland i firmly believe you really are old if you do n't like to watch totp .
well done for bringing good music to everyone .
cathy mccart , n. ireland the presenters trying to fool us that god save the queen by the sex pistols was n't really number one at all .
bob , uk boomtown rats reaching number one and bob geldof tearing up a photograph of olivia newton-john and john revolta after them hogging the number one spot for weeks , with that awful song from grease .
marianne h , uk when george best was in the audience neil ashurst , uk ex-pat in ghana the best episode has got to be when george best was in the audience grooving to the rolling stones singing the last time ...
1965 or thereabouts , brian jones with long blonde hair -lrb- outrageous -rrb- and keith richards with a baby-smooth face ¿ fantastic .
neil ashurst , uk ex-pat in ghana christmas day 1974 - slade - merry christmas was number one .
jumped up and down in front of our new colour tv set at the age of nine with my three younger siblings .
lovely memories .
tracy , uk in usa my father going mad at the who being on his television , then drooling at pan 's people - the only reason he would tolerate the show , until abba that is .
generations relate top of the pops to memories of growing up .
eileen , uk totp reflects chart music , but that is increasingly becoming a slave to the amount of publicity thrown into a band rather than the quality or popularity of their music .
as the charts become less and less relevant , so does totp .
even my little sister -lrb- aged 16 -rrb- has started watching repeats of the good life rather than sit through totp .
jo , uk it 's the sort of show that people of all ages can enjoy ! !
bekah , 12 , uk i think totp is still the number one music show .
it 's been going forever , my parents always talk about how they used to watch it and none of the songs and bands are as good as they were in the 80s .
it 's the sort of show that people of all ages can enjoy ! !
bekah , 12 , uk i remember marc almond singing tainted love for the first time on totp .
what a top song , at the time !
sad as it may sound , i went out the next day to get a pair of trousers with six pleats either side of the zip and so started my transformation into one of the futuristics .
sadly , my dad would n't let me get my ear pierced or dye my hair , so that was short-lived !
rob morris , uk best and most vivid memory of totp was as a ten-year-old seeing motorhead for the first time and thinking " what the * * * * is this ? ! ! " - great .
but these days totp is even more a victim of the mediocrity that pervades the charts than it ever was .
ian clifford , england the hollies , the most consistent band of the 60s and still going strong as they approach their 40th year .
john gillespie , uk my family mumbling " awful , tuneless rubbish " with me transfixed jon wild , england my big sister used to watch totp every week but i can distinctly remember the first time it grabbed my attention .
the exploited doing dead cities , the rest of my family mumbling " awful , tuneless rubbish " with me transfixed thinking it was the most exciting thing i 'd ever seen .
jon wild , england i remember when totp was broadcast on the cbs network during a six-month stint in 1987-1988 .
nia peeples hosted the us side of the programme , while gary davies hosted the uk side .
they would switch back and forth between the two showing the acts that were performing , as well as showing the charts , from both us and uk .
i did n't miss a show .
i wished that it would have stayed on longer here .
adam , usa faith no more performing epic , deliberately singing out of synch from the backing tape .
the orb playing chess , looking rather oblivious to goings-on , apparently because the producer had asked them to resemble some american rap group !
tom , uk i was in the totp audience in september 1991 during the dark years of unknowns presenting the show .
i remember clearly looking at cher screaming at the make-up artist and producers like a spoilt child because she had to do a second retake .
apart from that the rest was bland .
mark s , canada -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i felt the future had arrived iain , uk sitting through the vacuous horrors of gloria gaynor , rod stewart etc and then seeing gary numan for the first time doing are friends electric ?
suddenly i felt the future had arrived .
i was grinning for days .
iain , uk morrissey chucking lilies and sensitive urban angst all over the studio .
robbo , uk can you forget -lrb- and believe me , i 've tried ! -rrb-
terry wogan singing the floral dance ? ?
interesting to note that you only have to murmur " pan 's people " to reduce grown men to drooling idiots ! !
down , boys ! !
linda , uk nirvana playing smells like teen spirit with kurt cobain deliberately singing in a semi-operatic grunt and the bass player going completely mental !
s khan , uk , essex best : the rolling stones performing brown sugar live in 1971 with mick in full flow .
worst : 18 weeks of bryan adams singing that song again and again !
sean , uk totp was great in the 70s stewart , uk totp was great in the 70s , when the artists put on individual performances - slade , bay city rollers , bowie , kool and the gang .
sadly these days , totp serves up a conveyor belt of manufactured pap .
stewart , uk bad miming - and some very bad live acts , who remembers ace of base ?
i have to say that i miss seeing the videos as well .
sandra , uk totp is a victim of today 's music .
compare today 's manufactured bands with roxy music , any punk band , or led zeppelin and it 's no contest .
of course , it all went downhill when pan 's people left !
pepe , uk the orb , sitting on stage playing chess while the synth banged out blue room .
toby jones , uk gary glitter falling over those enormous silver shoes !
janice mclean , canada the glam rock period in the early seventies stands out the most in my mind .
early roxy music , bowie and t rex .
best memory though has to be gary glitter falling over while wearing those enormous silver platform shoes !
janice mclean , canada motorhead refusing to finish on time when they played ace of spades live , ozzy osbourne 's manic performance of paranoid , rolf harris performing stairway to heaven ...
happy days .
john , england suzi quatro looking totally hot , playing a bass guitar that was almost as big as she was .
any edition with both suzi and pan 's people would empty the streets of men for half an hour !
bill , uk my best totp memory is of arthur brown performing fire ! and setting fire to a colander-full of paper strapped to his head .
a classic performance which will never be repeated because of the health and safety laws .
david moran , scotland / australia the grandma playing the piano for lieutenant pigeon on mouldy old dough andy brown , uk the show reflects the inanity of the charts , but it did it so much better in the 70s .
who can forget the grandma playing the piano for lieutenant pigeon on mouldy old dough , or keith michel reciting stories of hissing sid and toad !
try dancing to that .
andy brown , uk jimi hendrix was all set to play when the wrong record started .
the great man drawled " i do n't know that one . "
roy handley , england in the pre-mtv era , totp was the only medium for many people to see their favourite pop bands .
now that there are tv channels that show pop music 24 hours a day and the music itself is far diverse than before , totp has become that archaic british institution , that we look at fondly , and really do n't have the heart to wind down .
the whole totp format was classically mocked in 1992 by the orb who appeared to promote their top 10 single - the blue room .
they were on for two minutes , although the song that charted was longer than entire show .
richard rackham , uk alex james from blur wearing an oasis t-shirt chris young , uk kurt cobain snogging the microphone during an octave-too-low version of smells like teen spirit while kris swung his bass around his head was top quality , as was alex james from blur wearing an oasis t-shirt when country house got to number one .
chris young , uk the infamous jocky / jackie wilson episode with dexy 's , rod and the faces playing football , iron maiden playing live with their first single , everything from the glam rock era of 71-74 .
oops , just realised my first two are in the intro of this page !
too busy dreaming of the good old days of totp to read !
reg pither , england jethro tull , living in the past .
offbeat , weird , catchy , and a flute as lead instrument .
turned me onto music big time .
andy , uk milli vanilli and well packed tight trousers .
angela , uk the pistols doing pretty vacant ian , england the defining moment of totp was the first performance of the pistols doing pretty vacant - fantastic .
ian , england boy george , do you really want to hurt me ? back in the early 80s .
the in-your-face , out-and-proud-to-be-gay cross-dresser sent shock waves through every living room in the country .
brilliant and courageous !
benny , uk ex-pat over the years i seem to have turned into my dad george , durham , uk the show is still great .
however i have noticed that over the years i seem to have turned into my dad .
i watch totp with my own children now and constantly harp on about how today 's acts are all rubbish , etc .
not like in my day .
george , durham , uk i have very fond memories of the show in the 60s and 70s .
i looked forward to it eagerly each week !
did n't we all adore pan 's people ?
i am now able to watch totp on bbc america , but it 's a very limp affair these days , with wishy-washy music and lots of remakes .
a shadow of its former self .
helen , uk / us easy one - pan 's people .
chris , us - ex-pat well said chris .
top of the pops was pan 's people and still is to just about all 40-something males in the uk !
simon mallett , uk chart topper 2,000th show chart attack fresh pops features still number one quiz : pop or flop ?
