johannesburg is a pretty sceptical town these days , if not outright cynical .
davis says the summit should concentrate on improving children 's health many of us doubt that very much will emerge from the summit when all the talking is over .
today , though , for an hour , i found myself almost hopeful again .
i had lunch with a 17-year-old british schoolgirl , rowenna davis , from london .
she is afraid she may be naive .
i think she may be too good to be true .
regardless , she has done more to try to make the summit work than most of us .
initiative what rowenna did was to earn money - £ 1,800 -lsb- $ 2788 -rsb- - to back her belief that one person can change the world .
the rio summit was about talking , johannesburg is about walking rowenna davis she raised the cash by tutoring for three hours a night , four nights a week .
she took packed lunches to school , and walked instead of riding buses when she had to get somewhere .
she did not go to the cinema , and for 18 months the only chocolate she has eaten is a fairly traded brand - expensive , but she disapproves of cocoa production methods .
with the money she raised , she paid to have 10,000 posters printed , all bearing messages connected with the summit 's preoccupations .
then she enlisted a team of 150 friends to act as flyposters throughout london .
" they thought it was just one of my schemes at first " , she says .
" but i get respect from them now . "
making a difference she did n't tell her mother what she was up to until the week before the posters were delivered .
blair has good ideas but " is failing to implement them " , davis says and her mother did n't believe what she heard .
many teenagers who might have saved almost £ 2,000 -lsb- $ 3,100 -rsb- might find other uses for it than printing posters exhorting us to save the ozone layer .
i asked rowenna why she had n't blown the cash on a decent holiday , or something else to indulge herself .
" i 'm very cynical about what can come out of the summit " , she explains .
" but i do n't regret my campaign for an instant .
every individual can make a difference . "
she thinks the uk prime minister , tony blair , " is a good man , who probably has the right ideas " , she says .
" but he 's failing to implement them .
he seems very behind the us , and very afraid to step away from it . "
future worries asked what message she would like to give the world leaders assembling in johannesburg , she is in no doubt .
" the rio summit was about talking " , she replies , " johannesburg is about walking .
the definition of democracy is representation of the people .
" what kind of democracy is it when you ca n't represent the people of the future ?
how long can you live like this ? "
but she worries about the present as well as the future , not least about the daily toll of more than 30,000 under-fives who die from hunger or easily-prevented diseases .
" what about 12 september , and 13 september , and 14 september and all the rest ? " , she asks .
but it is not a question .
as she leaves , she is still worried that she may be naive .
there are worse things to be .

sir nicholas montagu told the times the " rather fierce " fines would be " an extremely powerful deterrent " .

they pay £ 100 late-payment fines every year and almost half of those incur a further £ 100 fine , a 5 % surcharge on the unpaid debt plus interest at 6.5 % .
taxpayers complain the 10-page self-assessment tax return is over-complicated .
" levying daily penalties is an extremely powerful deterrent , " sir nicholas told the times .

" the only way that people can put an end to the £ 60-a-day penalty is by filing their tax return . "
fewer than 80,000 people have used the revenue 's online self-assessment service since its launch in april 2000 - despite a £ 10 discount .
it was suspended in june after a security breach allowed some people 's confidential information to be read by others .

police constables mark lenihan and timothy hopkins persuaded the woman , who was threatening suicide , to return to the shore after swimming the 400-yards to rescue her in may .
persuading suicidal people to return to safety is never easy , but it must be even harder during a 400-yard swim major general christopher tyler the south wales police officers have received a top honour for their life saving effort .
the royal humane society testimonial accolade was awarded to the men in recognition of their act of bravery .
about 100 of these awards are issued each year by the society which was formed by a group of london doctors in 1774 .
it is the leading uk organisation responsible for honouring lifesavers and those who have been involved in heroic rescue incidents .
major general christopher tyler , secretary of the royal humane society , praised the bravery of the two policemen .
" persuading suicidal people to return to safety is never easy , but it must be even harder during a 400-yard swim " " however , these two fine officers carried it off marvellously , proving themselves to be a credit to the force .
" they thoroughly deserve their awards , " he said .
appeal the society awarded the honour to the two officers after a personal recommendation from south wales ' chief constable sir tony burden .
major tyler has appealed for members of the public to tell him about the heroic efforts of people in wales .

thousands of people owe huge amounts of money because they signed up to bank of scotland 's innovative ' shared appreciation mortgage ' just before house prices started to rise sharply .
this mortgage was designed largely for older people who already owned their homes but wanted to raise extra money - usually to supplement pensions .
it was so innovative at the time , it was selected by the design council as one of its best of british millennium products .
but now its reputation is severely tarnished .
how it worked it was really an equity release plan , allowing people to borrow up to a quarter of the value of the home , interest free .
but customers had to agree in return that the bank could take three quarters of any future increase in the value of the property .
that seemed fine back then as property prices were hardly moving .
but in the five years since they are up a phenomenal 83 % .
many people have been contacting the bbc 's money box programme about the huge repayments they must now make as a result .
not transferable john was 69 when he borrowed just over £ 21,000 on his house , then worth £ 85,000 .
his home 's value has increased by £ 50,000 , so the bank would ask for £ 37,000 if he decides to move home and redeem the mortgage , which is not transferable to another property .
he estimates if house prices continue to rise as they are , bank of scotland will stand to make over £ 100,000 in 10 years time .
' daylight robbery ' another listener , louise , only discovered the terms of this mortgage when she was left to sort out the financial affairs of her aunt and uncle after they had died .
they had borrowed £ 15,000 pounds in a bank of scotland shared appreciation mortgage in 1997 . "
even loan sharks would be embarrassed by this rate of return " money box listener louise when the property was sold , bank of scotland took close to half of it - £ 41,000 pounds out of the £ 90,000 price it fetched .
" this is complete daylight robbery " louise told money box , " even loan sharks would be embarrassed by this rate of return . "
surviving relatives , who knew nothing of the deal that had been signed , received a lower inheritance .
but louise was most concerned that if her aunt moved into a care home she would have had to sell the property and there might not be enough to pay for all care after bank of scotland had taken its huge cut .
in other cases people have now cashed in investments or asked relatives for the money to help them bail out .
profit rights bank of scotland says in fact it is not profiting from these deals anymore , instead it is a private undisclosed investor to whom it sold the profit rights via a city firm .
it adds that because of this it is now impossible for bos to make changes to the way the mortgage works or what people must pay .
complaining about this mortgage does not work either .
although the effects of a property price boom were not spelled out in the documents , people were expected to have worked that out for themselves .
so most people will be stuck with it unless relatives can step in and pay off the bank .
of course if there were to be a property price crash people would not owe the bank so much .
but at present this looks like another classic example of the financial services industry profiting from being one step ahead .

the place is ukraine and at the focus of the battle is metal .
unlike many of its former soviet neighbours , the impoverished state of 50 million has enjoyed relative calm since the break-up of the soviet union .
but ukraine , like some others in eastern europe , seems nowhere near victory over the insidious " enemy from within " , as one local daily put it .
the enemy attacks and destroys everything that contains even a few dollars worth of metal which can be sold as scrap , wreaking havoc across the country .
easy money as living standards plummeted , many people discovered that everyday details of the landscape such as power cables and sewer gratings are commodities just waiting to be snatched and sold for profit .
with the average monthly wage well below $ 100 , a few pounds of copper from a stolen phone cable , the favourite prey of " metal hunters " , can bring more cash than a hard day 's work . "
the greatest danger to a military unit is now posed by the enemy that knows his way to a scrap dealer " kievskiye vedomosti the residents of some apartment blocks have been reduced to organizing night shifts to guard their building 's power lines , ukrainian television reported .
previously a power blackout , a dead phone line or a car stuck in a gaping sewer hole was the worst that could happen .
now the country 's railways and even the army are feeling the pinch , and unlucky metal hunters can even pay with their lives for a few pounds of scrap .
hard consequences earlier this month , a railway engine and three freight cars derailed near the port of mykolayiv after local metal hunters dismantled a 50kg set of points .
there were no casualties , but the cars and the rail track suffered hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage , and traffic on the railway line was blocked for a whole day .
the thieves , who were promptly caught by the police , hoped to make less than $ 6 selling the points mechanism as scrap , ukrainian television said .
a few days later , a powerful bomb explosion ripped through a derelict air base to the east of kiev .
the 15-year-old scrap hunter who found an old 120-pound bomb and tried to dismantle it was killed on the spot .
on the same day , a 14-year-old girl was found dead inside a power substation .
she was electrocuted while trying to steal a few metres of cable , the tv reported .
army under fire the ukrainian army , still reeling from the air show disaster in lviv which killed 76 spectators , suffered further embarrassment when the navy corvette kremenchuk was held up in broad daylight and robbed of its communication equipment . "
yesterday they took out a missile installation , today they feel at home on board a warship - where will they turn up tomorrow ? "
kievskiye vedomosti the equipment contained several thousand dollars worth of precious metals .
the local daily kievskiye vedomosti was in shock .
" three 22-year-old blockheads with no training , no skills and no special gear boarded the ship , attacked an officer , took the keys from the command post , grabbed the ship 's radio and waved goodbye to the crew , " the paper wrote .
things had not been that bad since a ukrainian air defence installation , the famous s-300 anti-aircraft missile system , lost its communication components to another gang of thieves .
" the greatest danger to a military unit is now posed by the enemy that knows his way to a scrap dealer .
yesterday they took out a missile installation , today they feel at home on board a warship .
where will they turn up tomorrow ? " the paper fulminated .
no respite in sight the government is well aware of the problem , and several attempts have already been made to crack down on scrap dealers .
the measures already tried range from persuading them to turn down dodgy offers to closing their businesses altogether .
however , analysts say , with the average wage in ukraine just above the official subsistence level , supply is unlikely to dwindle as long as demand is there .
and the local bureaucracy will hardly want to lose a source of modest but steady backhanders from the scrap dealers .
until that changes , a wooden sewer grating will last longer in ukraine than a cast-iron model .

" the abruptness of the announcement left many wondering why it is to be held now , " japan 's yomiuri shimbun remarks .
the daily , mainichi shimbun , reports that the ruling party is generally " unsettled " by prime minister junichiro koizumi 's " sudden decision to visit north korea " .
under the circumstances , koizumi has apparently judged the summit with kim as the only way to achieve a breakthrough jiji press news agency it quotes a senior official of the liberal democratic party as saying : " it 's fine if all goes well , but i think there will be more harm than benefits .

" koizumi himself acknowledges that he does not think ... that it will easily bring about solutions to pending issues , " the agency says .
the agency points out that the two countries have held a series of meetings this year , but with no progress in solving core issues such as the alleged abductions of japanese nationals by north korean agents .

" leaving those matters unclear and simply jumping to the question of relations and compensation will only preserve the current military dictatorship , " it warns .
south korean newspaper agree that the north korea 's nuclear capability is not to be overlooked in the discussions .
koizumi should " clearly convey the common position of south korea , the usa , and japan " on north 's nuclear and missile programs and the importance of easing tension on the korean peninsula , choson ilbo says .

denmark 's foreign minister per stig moeller said europe supported the un fully and urged the united states to continue broad consultations on the issue . "
a great deal of this debate would be avoided if saddam hussein readmitted the weapons inspectors without conditions and without restrictions " jack straw mr moeller , who has been hosting a meeting of foreign ministers in the danish town of elsinore , added that no decision had been taken about military action because no-one had as yet proposed a war .
uk prime minister tony blair has meanwhile warned saddam hussein that the world could not stand by while iraq was in " flagrant breach " of un resolutions .
" doing nothing about iraq 's breach of these un resolutions is not an option , " he said .
" that 's the only decision that 's been taken so far .
what we do about that is an open question . "
the bbc 's oana lungescu , reporting from elsinore , says that even britain - america 's closest ally in europe - appears worried by washington 's growing determination to confront iraq with or without a un resolution .
eu external affairs commissioner chris patten said everyone recognised the threat from iraq , but that it would take cool heads to plot the right way forward .
eu diplomats are insisting that it is up to the un security council to consider other measures if iraq fails to allow back the inspectors .
british foreign secretary jack straw told the bbc there was overwhelming support for their re-admission , adding that the threat of military action had to remain to ensure they could do their jobs properly .
mr straw said the british parliament would be consulted in the event of the cabinet deciding that military action was necessary , although he said it was unlikely to be recalled in the next few weeks .
french and german leaders have publicly opposed any unilateral us strike .
former us president bill clinton has also sounded a note of caution .
he said that a us attack on iraq might give saddam an excuse to use weapons of mass destruction against the us and its allies .
mr clinton said there was no question that the iraqi president was violating un resolutions and probably stockpiling chemical and biological weapons .
but he said that there should be plenty of public debate on the issue .
' cooling the heat ' at their meeting , the eu ministers also discussed controversial us requests for bilateral deals that would circumvent the newly created icc , in an attempt to lower the temperature in the dispute .
but mr moeller said the bottom line was that the icc should not be undermined , adding that legal advisers had been charged with working out a common position .
the european commission reacted angrily earlier this month to washington 's insistence on concluding bilateral deals that would exempt americans from icc prosecution , arguing that they would fatally undermine the newly created court .
there have been signs that italy and britain are prepared to sign such agreements , but diplomats from both countries said they were prepared to hold off until the eu had agreed a common position .

the 29-year-old convert to islam was arrested trying to board a flight to britain after he a gun was found in his hand luggage .
police ordered all passengers to leave the plane to search baggage the man - whom has been named in some newspapers as kerim chatty - denied knowledge of the gun and said he was on his way to an islamic conference in birmingham in central england .
the conference is for followers of the salafi school of islamic thought , believed to have connections to osama bin laden , the 11 september hijackers and alleged plane shoe-bomber richard reid .
british police - said to include anti-terrorism experts from scotland yard - are working closely with their swedish counterparts on the case .
' too early to know ' swedish officials said it was too early to know if the suspected hijacker had any terror links .
police spokesman ulf palm said : " we do n't want to reveal much information , at least for now .
more people may be implicated . "
the suspect has previous convictions for theft and assault , mr palm added .
britain 's foreign secretary jack straw said the arrest showed " the threat of international terrorism remains " .
the man , who was arrested at vasteras airport , 100km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- north-west of stockholm , was born in sweden to tunisian parents .
although some unnamed officials have said they believe the man was not part of a criminal group , fears of a terrorist connection have been raised with the approach of the first anniversary of the 11 september attacks and the apparent link to the salafi conference .
salafi school the suspect was part of a group with 18 other adults and two children apparently bound for the birmingham meeting .
police released the people who had been travelling with the suspect the leaders of the salafi school have always denounced acts of violence or terrorism and organisers of the conference condemned the latest incident , adding they did not believe the suspect was going to attend .
prosecutors in sweden have until early next week to decide whether to bring formal charges against the man .
mr palm said on friday : " we believe he was going to hijack the plane . "
the offence carries a sentence of between six months and life imprisonment in sweden . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's stephen sackur " ryanair officials said the incident had been handled in text book fashion " airport security adviser gunnar harmen " it 's not difficult to find a gun when they 're screening your luggage " see also : 30 aug 02 -pipe- europe swedish airport security praised 30 aug 02 -pipe- england hijack suspect ' not attending conference ' 30 aug 02 -pipe- europe ' it ca n't get more scary than this ' 08 aug 02 -pipe- uk air passengers ' flouting ' security rules 08 aug 02 -pipe- breakfast what 's lurking in your luggage ? 19 jul 02 -pipe- europe hijack scare forces emergency landing internet links : ryanair swedish police -lrb- in english -rrb- vasteras airport the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top europe stories now : prominent kosovo suspect held turkey ups stakes on us troops ' new europe ' backs eu on iraq omagh detectives make arrest beckham forgives ferguson blair keeps euro options open waiter jailed for underage sex democratic test for armenia links to more europe stories are at the foot of the page .
