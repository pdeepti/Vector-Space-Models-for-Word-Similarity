massive security was in place to prevent clashes between the rival demonstrations , which marked the anniversary of the country 's transition to democracy in 1958 .
the marches on wednesday passed off peacefully on the rain-soaked streets .
a 36-hour ban on carrying guns was announced ahead of the demonstrations .
opponents of the leftist president and his " peaceful revolution " banged pots and pans and waved venezuelan flags and placards reading : " chavez resign " .
the president 's supporters held a counter-march four blocks away and the two groups were separated by about 3,000 police and national guard officers .
opposition unites mr chavez joined the march , wearing his trademark red beret , and was mobbed by supporters .
in a fierce speech that , by law , had to be broadcast by all venezuelan radio and television stations , mr chavez accused the independent news media of inflating the size and importance of the opposition march and of " sowing hate " among venezuelans .
he said his " march of the patriots " had defeated " the march of the filthy ones " led by an opposition " mafia " .
i voted for chavez but i feel betrayed shopkeeper arquimedes gonzalez violence broke out at the end of similar demonstrations last year .
anti-chavez organisers were hoping to draw together trade unionists , business leaders , conservative political parties and civil rights groups in protest at the president 's sweeping reform programme .
they had to re-route their march after the president announced a counter-demonstration and the two looked set to meet outside congress .
" we want chavez out of office .
we do n't need him , he is crazy , " growled one marcher .
opposition groups attack the populist former army officer 's attempts to tackle corruption and redistribute wealth as authoritarian , saying he is eroding the civil rights gained when general marcos perez jimenez was ousted in an uprising 44 years ago .
they also say his strong criticism of the press has led to attacks on journalists .
reforms feared " i voted for chavez but i feel betrayed , " said arquimedes gonzalez , a shopkeeper from the northern state of sucre .
" we have to defend the democracy that we built after we ousted perez jimenez . "
but government supporters say opposition protests are the country 's elite digging in their heels against reforms which will hit their pockets .
" we came in solidarity with the president 's call , " said one marcher , also wearing a red beret .
" we share the ideals of a sovereign country , free and independent and living in equality . "
defence minister jose vicente rangel , also in the government march , said : " this is the best proof that we are living in a real democracy where people can demonstrate . "
mr chavez was elected president of venezuela , the world 's fourth largest oil exporter , in 1998 , six years after he led a failed coup attempt .
his action-man image and revolutionary rhetoric were initially well received among the 24 million venezuelans living in poverty .
general strike but he split the country along class lines and his approval rating dropped from 60 % in january last year to 35 % in december .
last month , millions of venezuelans staged a general strike in protest against 49 laws imposed under special decree , including an unpopular land law allowing the government to seize and redistribute land deemed unproductive .
mr chavez has also recently introduced laws giving the state a stake in all new oil ventures and almost doubling the royalties oil companies must pay .

mr byers was speaking at a meeting of the national rail conference in london as angry train passengers faced the threat of more strikes in the next week .
in this day and age , disputes over pay should not give rise to strikes transport secretary stephen byers the embattled minister used the speech to say the masterplan for improving the uk 's ailing rail network must tackle poor performance and reliability .
passengers deserved better service and the strikes had not helped matters , mr byers told the audience at the queen elizabeth ii conference centre .
strikes ahead guards on arriva trains northern are staging a 48-hour stoppage over pay on thursday and friday .
members of the rail maritime and transport -lrb- rmt -rrb- on south west trains are also planning further strikes .
there are worries too that the london underground could be hit by strikes in a separate pay dispute .
mr byers told the conference : " strike action is in no-one 's interest ...
" in this day and age , disputes over pay should not give rise to strikes .
negotiation , not strike action , must be the only way forward .
" arbitration must be a better way forward than strike action - action which is really just a matter of strength . "
boosting performance saying the government was on the side of passengers , not unions or management , mr byers warned strikes would " turn people off the rail network " .
he also outlined how the measures in the strategic rail authority plan unveiled earlier this month aimed to improve the railway network nationwide .
mr byers said : " the public want simple things .
they want reliable trains that turn up on time and arrive on time and stations that are clean and safe . "
he called on all train operators to examine how they could improve performance with the help of the sra .
the transport secretary promised he would not be distracted from getting on with the job .
" i am not going to be judged by tomorrow 's headlines , i will be judged at the end of the time of the next general election . "
transport underspend mr byers has continued to come under attack after it emerged his department failed to spend Â£ 350m of its capital budget last year .
the minister insisted last week he had introduced steps to reduce the underspend - currently running at 5.5 % of the capital budget .
but his conservative opposite number theresa may cast doubt on whether he would be able to deliver the 10-year plan .
when he unveiled the blueprint , mr byers said a Â£ 67.5bn package of measures to upgrade the railways would " put passengers first " .
but the plan relies on private investors matching public investment .
tube dispute as well as problems on the mainline rail network , london underground -lrb- lu -rrb- also faces the threat of strikes .
tube drivers are to be balloted over the next few weeks over a series of 48-hour strikes .
aslef and the rmt union have accused london underground of reneging on a deal agreed last year to avert industrial action , a claim the company denies .
the dispute centres on different rates of pay for drivers of passenger trains and others who drive engineering trains .
london underground said it had been " honest and open " in its dealings with the unions , adding that threatening strikes was " unnecessarily premature and aggressive " .
thousands of passengers endured disruption earlier this month because of strikes on south west trains services .
