it may prove yet another fatal blow to nature in europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
so much so , that virus ’ have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .

investigation into the cause of the accident will continue throughout the day . a russian tupolev 154 carrying vacationers from moscow to barcelona collided with a dhl cargo jet around 11:40 p.m. on monday night .

air traffic controllers said they had to ask the russian crew three times before they got a reaction .
meanwhile , the dhl aircraft 's warning system instructed that pilot to dive .
both planes were descending when they collided .
debris was spread over a wide area and a number of buildings were set on fire - including a school .
bashkirian airlines operated the tupolev 154 charter flight .
an unconfirmed statement by an airline spokesman said there were 49 people under the age of 18 aboard , and that they were the children of high-ranking russian officials .
a spanish hotel where the group had been booked told news agencies that the children planned to spend their holidays at the spanish resort of vilaseca , which is located near the popular theme park port aventura .
just before its fiery crash , the plane made a stop in munich .
some 500 police and search and rescue workers are now combing the area around überlingen searching for the remains of the victims and examining the wreckage .

but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .

it may prove yet another fatal blow to nature in europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
so much so , that virus ’ have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2002 apartheid lawsuit extends to german banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is a target of the lawsuit an american lawyer is adding three german banks to a class action suit seeking reparations for victims of apartheid in south africa .
but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .
khulumani has filed a suit against president thabo mbeki seeking a copy of the government ’ s draft reparations policy in advance of the official release date . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a u.s. federal bureau of investigation report released in may noted that terrorists and their weapons had successfully infiltrated the country concealed in shipping containers .
in a preemptive measure to stop any further terrorists from getting into the country , u.s. customs service experts are currently cooperating with european port authorities in france , belgium and holland .
u.s. government officials are also negotiating with berlin to extend the cooperation to german harbors .
germany 's federal ministry of finance , which is responsible for customs regulations , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the countries are currently negotiating an increased cooperative relationship .
however , a spokesman for the ministry said no agreement has been reached yet .
stepped up security in the aftermath of september 11 , american politicians proposed providing customs inspectors at ports with additional training to help them ferret out containers that might be storing chemical or biological weapons .
they are also seeking to send inspectors to facilities abroad , including those in europe .
new x-ray scanners , which cost $ 10 million -lrb- 10.15 million euro -rrb- a piece , can penetrate even densely packed containers and can be programmed to detect explosive or radioactive materials .
u.s. customs has also developed software that can flag suspicious cargo based on its origin and route .
a trend towards european cooperation the u.s. has already secured permission to station specially trained american customs officials in three large european ports in the coming weeks .
the agreement , announced last week , will first involve the ports of rotterdam in the netherlands , antwerp in belgium and le havre in france .
rotterdam , the world ’ s largest seaport , was the first european harbor to agree to the arrangement .
rotterdam already has its own system in place for risk analysis of the more than 400 million containers that pass through in a year .
rotterdam 's europoort will now buttress its own program by adding u.s. expertise and the u.s. customs database .
officials are optimistic about the cooperation .

" we 'll start with a six-month pilot project and then see if it 's useful to continue . "
finding a needle in a haystack if german officials agree to participate , the most likely test port would be bremerhaven , located near the northern german city bremen .
there , customs inspectors face the same challenges as their american counterparts .
at bremerhaven , inspectors have the overall capacity to inspect only one percent of the containers being processed , der spiegel reported .
while the american government continues to allocate special funding to increase port security , german customs officials still operate on tighter budgets .
officials at bremerhaven fear that adding additional freight to the volume it already checks could dramatically increase costs and reduce the port 's competitiveness .
mainly exchange of information " what it ’ s going to amount to is mainly an exchange of information , " arne petrick , a customs officer in hamburg , told der spiegel .
but petrick told the magazine it was unlikely the u.s. would be permitted to partake in actual patrols at german harbors because of germany 's strict tax secrecy laws , which forbid making data about the contents of freight available to third parties .
additionally , the two countries will have to negotiate how to fund the increase in personnel and equipment upgrades cooperation would require .

the proposal , outlined in a 50-page plan that was leaked to the media ahead of the meetings , calls for spending 267 million euros -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- over the next four years to improve citizen understanding of the eu .
campaign to promote legitimacy the document - prepared by the eu commissioner for justice and home affairs , antonio vitorino , in cooperation with commission president romano prodi - calls for a campaign to promote " the legitimacy , image and role of the union . "
" a true eu communication method can not be limited to mere diffusion of information : it must give a sense to things and put the eu 's actions and policies in perspective . ...
experience shows that information can not remain neutral because of the constant distortion by the media , intermediaries and other multipliers of opinion , " the plan stated .
the document , titled " an information and communication strategy for the european union , " called for better coordination between three main eu institutions : the council , commission and parliament .
the eu already has some 700 information centers throughout its 15 member states .
but the report said that these have not been able to adequately influence public opinion .
putting on a friendly face the report said that leaders in the realms of business , women 's rights , and education must be recruited to speak out in favor of a united europe .
" the eu cruelly lacks a ' face ' vis-a-vis the ordinary citizens , " the report said .
the plan recommends starting a pr campaign in september by setting up focus groups in each member state and working with the public opinion research departments of each state as well .
a little-known group know as the inter-institutional information group -lrb- gii -rrb- that meets twice a year with representation from the three main eu instiutions would play a central role in defining the new pr strategy .
under the proposal , the new pr program would be operational in time for expected euro referendums in britain and sweden .
new-fangled flag the proposal comes on the heels of another eu effort to add shine to its image : by redesigning the union 's flag .
star architect rem koolhaas from holland was asked by prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt to suggest a new flag .
the result is a bar code-like multicolored image was created by blending all the colors of the national flags of eu nations .
if adopted , the flag would replace the current one which features 12 stars on a blue background .
the current flag was adoped in 1986 , when each star was meant to represent a member state .
as the eu has grown - and with new members in sight - the flag has become outdated .
koolhaas , meanwhile , was also present at a recent round-table discussion that included 12 top european thinkers and executives including author umberto eco and swatch inventor nicolas hayek .

it may prove yet another fatal blow to nature in europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
so much so , that virus ’ have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .

driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
already , local administration is bracing itself .
however , local crisis management is reduced largely to one thing : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .

it may prove yet another fatal blow to nature in europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
so much so , that virus ’ have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
already , local administration is bracing itself .

it may prove yet another fatal blow to nature in europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
so much so , that virus ’ have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .

is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .

investigation into the cause of the accident will continue throughout the day . a russian tupolev 154 carrying vacationers from moscow to barcelona collided with a dhl cargo jet around 11:40 p.m. on monday night .
dhl 's boeing 757 had originated in bahrain and was on its way to brussels .
officials say the two aircraft crashed in mid-air near lake constance on the german-swiss border near the town of überlingen .
swiss authorities say both craft were on a collision course when swiss ground control instructed the tupolev to descend .
air traffic controllers said they had to ask the russian crew three times before they got a reaction .

both planes were descending when they collided .
debris was spread over a wide area and a number of buildings were set on fire - including a school .
bashkirian airlines operated the tupolev 154 charter flight .
an unconfirmed statement by an airline spokesman said there were 49 people under the age of 18 aboard , and that they were the children of high-ranking russian officials .

it may prove yet another fatal blow to nature in europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
so much so , that virus ’ have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .

indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .

a u.s. federal bureau of investigation report released in may noted that terrorists and their weapons had successfully infiltrated the country concealed in shipping containers .
in a preemptive measure to stop any further terrorists from getting into the country , u.s. customs service experts are currently cooperating with european port authorities in france , belgium and holland .
u.s. government officials are also negotiating with berlin to extend the cooperation to german harbors .
germany 's federal ministry of finance , which is responsible for customs regulations , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the countries are currently negotiating an increased cooperative relationship .
however , a spokesman for the ministry said no agreement has been reached yet .
stepped up security in the aftermath of september 11 , american politicians proposed providing customs inspectors at ports with additional training to help them ferret out containers that might be storing chemical or biological weapons .
they are also seeking to send inspectors to facilities abroad , including those in europe .
new x-ray scanners , which cost $ 10 million -lrb- 10.15 million euro -rrb- a piece , can penetrate even densely packed containers and can be programmed to detect explosive or radioactive materials .
u.s. customs has also developed software that can flag suspicious cargo based on its origin and route .
a trend towards european cooperation the u.s. has already secured permission to station specially trained american customs officials in three large european ports in the coming weeks .
the agreement , announced last week , will first involve the ports of rotterdam in the netherlands , antwerp in belgium and le havre in france .
rotterdam , the world ’ s largest seaport , was the first european harbor to agree to the arrangement .
rotterdam already has its own system in place for risk analysis of the more than 400 million containers that pass through in a year .
rotterdam 's europoort will now buttress its own program by adding u.s. expertise and the u.s. customs database .
officials are optimistic about the cooperation .
" we 're basically fine-tuning the system , " renee wesdorp , a spokeswoman for dutch customs told the new york times .
" we 'll start with a six-month pilot project and then see if it 's useful to continue . "
finding a needle in a haystack if german officials agree to participate , the most likely test port would be bremerhaven , located near the northern german city bremen .
there , customs inspectors face the same challenges as their american counterparts .
at bremerhaven , inspectors have the overall capacity to inspect only one percent of the containers being processed , der spiegel reported .
while the american government continues to allocate special funding to increase port security , german customs officials still operate on tighter budgets .
officials at bremerhaven fear that adding additional freight to the volume it already checks could dramatically increase costs and reduce the port 's competitiveness .
mainly exchange of information " what it ’ s going to amount to is mainly an exchange of information , " arne petrick , a customs officer in hamburg , told der spiegel .
but petrick told the magazine it was unlikely the u.s. would be permitted to partake in actual patrols at german harbors because of germany 's strict tax secrecy laws , which forbid making data about the contents of freight available to third parties .
additionally , the two countries will have to negotiate how to fund the increase in personnel and equipment upgrades cooperation would require .
a vulnerable position fears of terrorists stowing away on freighter ships are well grounded .
in october , italian customs discovered an egyptian man with suspected al qaeda ties in a container bound for canada . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the proposal , outlined in a 50-page plan that was leaked to the media ahead of the meetings , calls for spending 267 million euros -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- over the next four years to improve citizen understanding of the eu .
campaign to promote legitimacy the document - prepared by the eu commissioner for justice and home affairs , antonio vitorino , in cooperation with commission president romano prodi - calls for a campaign to promote " the legitimacy , image and role of the union . "
" a true eu communication method can not be limited to mere diffusion of information : it must give a sense to things and put the eu 's actions and policies in perspective . ...
experience shows that information can not remain neutral because of the constant distortion by the media , intermediaries and other multipliers of opinion , " the plan stated .
the document , titled " an information and communication strategy for the european union , " called for better coordination between three main eu institutions : the council , commission and parliament .
the eu already has some 700 information centers throughout its 15 member states .
but the report said that these have not been able to adequately influence public opinion .
putting on a friendly face the report said that leaders in the realms of business , women 's rights , and education must be recruited to speak out in favor of a united europe .
" the eu cruelly lacks a ' face ' vis-a-vis the ordinary citizens , " the report said .
the plan recommends starting a pr campaign in september by setting up focus groups in each member state and working with the public opinion research departments of each state as well .
a little-known group know as the inter-institutional information group -lrb- gii -rrb- that meets twice a year with representation from the three main eu instiutions would play a central role in defining the new pr strategy .
under the proposal , the new pr program would be operational in time for expected euro referendums in britain and sweden .
new-fangled flag the proposal comes on the heels of another eu effort to add shine to its image : by redesigning the union 's flag .
star architect rem koolhaas from holland was asked by prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt to suggest a new flag .
the result is a bar code-like multicolored image was created by blending all the colors of the national flags of eu nations .
if adopted , the flag would replace the current one which features 12 stars on a blue background .
the current flag was adoped in 1986 , when each star was meant to represent a member state .
as the eu has grown - and with new members in sight - the flag has become outdated .
koolhaas , meanwhile , was also present at a recent round-table discussion that included 12 top european thinkers and executives including author umberto eco and swatch inventor nicolas hayek .
among other recommendations coming out of this meeting were the creation of multi-lingual schools and partnerships between brussels and european businesses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for a european constitution french and german leaders are meeting in nantes today for a one-day summit on the future of the european union .

but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .

it may prove yet another fatal blow to nature in europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
so much so , that virus ’ have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
already , local administration is bracing itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2002 apartheid lawsuit extends to german banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is a target of the lawsuit an american lawyer is adding three german banks to a class action suit seeking reparations for victims of apartheid in south africa .
but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .
khulumani has filed a suit against president thabo mbeki seeking a copy of the government ’ s draft reparations policy in advance of the official release date . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it may prove yet another fatal blow to nature in europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
so much so , that virus ’ have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2002 apartheid lawsuit extends to german banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is a target of the lawsuit an american lawyer is adding three german banks to a class action suit seeking reparations for victims of apartheid in south africa .
but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .
khulumani has filed a suit against president thabo mbeki seeking a copy of the government ’ s draft reparations policy in advance of the official release date . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .

it may prove yet another fatal blow to nature in europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
so much so , that virus ’ have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
already , local administration is bracing itself .
however , local crisis management is reduced largely to one thing : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the proposal , outlined in a 50-page plan that was leaked to the media ahead of the meetings , calls for spending 267 million euros -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- over the next four years to improve citizen understanding of the eu .
campaign to promote legitimacy the document - prepared by the eu commissioner for justice and home affairs , antonio vitorino , in cooperation with commission president romano prodi - calls for a campaign to promote " the legitimacy , image and role of the union . "
" a true eu communication method can not be limited to mere diffusion of information : it must give a sense to things and put the eu 's actions and policies in perspective . ...
experience shows that information can not remain neutral because of the constant distortion by the media , intermediaries and other multipliers of opinion , " the plan stated .
the document , titled " an information and communication strategy for the european union , " called for better coordination between three main eu institutions : the council , commission and parliament .
the eu already has some 700 information centers throughout its 15 member states .
but the report said that these have not been able to adequately influence public opinion .

but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .
khulumani has filed a suit against president thabo mbeki seeking a copy of the government ’ s draft reparations policy in advance of the official release date . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a u.s. federal bureau of investigation report released in may noted that terrorists and their weapons had successfully infiltrated the country concealed in shipping containers .
in a preemptive measure to stop any further terrorists from getting into the country , u.s. customs service experts are currently cooperating with european port authorities in france , belgium and holland .
u.s. government officials are also negotiating with berlin to extend the cooperation to german harbors .
germany 's federal ministry of finance , which is responsible for customs regulations , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the countries are currently negotiating an increased cooperative relationship .
however , a spokesman for the ministry said no agreement has been reached yet .
stepped up security in the aftermath of september 11 , american politicians proposed providing customs inspectors at ports with additional training to help them ferret out containers that might be storing chemical or biological weapons .
they are also seeking to send inspectors to facilities abroad , including those in europe .
new x-ray scanners , which cost $ 10 million -lrb- 10.15 million euro -rrb- a piece , can penetrate even densely packed containers and can be programmed to detect explosive or radioactive materials .
u.s. customs has also developed software that can flag suspicious cargo based on its origin and route .
a trend towards european cooperation the u.s. has already secured permission to station specially trained american customs officials in three large european ports in the coming weeks .
the agreement , announced last week , will first involve the ports of rotterdam in the netherlands , antwerp in belgium and le havre in france .
rotterdam , the world ’ s largest seaport , was the first european harbor to agree to the arrangement .
rotterdam already has its own system in place for risk analysis of the more than 400 million containers that pass through in a year .
rotterdam 's europoort will now buttress its own program by adding u.s. expertise and the u.s. customs database .
officials are optimistic about the cooperation .
" we 're basically fine-tuning the system , " renee wesdorp , a spokeswoman for dutch customs told the new york times .
" we 'll start with a six-month pilot project and then see if it 's useful to continue . "
finding a needle in a haystack if german officials agree to participate , the most likely test port would be bremerhaven , located near the northern german city bremen .
there , customs inspectors face the same challenges as their american counterparts .
at bremerhaven , inspectors have the overall capacity to inspect only one percent of the containers being processed , der spiegel reported .
while the american government continues to allocate special funding to increase port security , german customs officials still operate on tighter budgets .
officials at bremerhaven fear that adding additional freight to the volume it already checks could dramatically increase costs and reduce the port 's competitiveness .
mainly exchange of information " what it ’ s going to amount to is mainly an exchange of information , " arne petrick , a customs officer in hamburg , told der spiegel .
but petrick told the magazine it was unlikely the u.s. would be permitted to partake in actual patrols at german harbors because of germany 's strict tax secrecy laws , which forbid making data about the contents of freight available to third parties .
additionally , the two countries will have to negotiate how to fund the increase in personnel and equipment upgrades cooperation would require .
a vulnerable position fears of terrorists stowing away on freighter ships are well grounded .

indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .

scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .

the proposal , outlined in a 50-page plan that was leaked to the media ahead of the meetings , calls for spending 267 million euros -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- over the next four years to improve citizen understanding of the eu .
campaign to promote legitimacy the document - prepared by the eu commissioner for justice and home affairs , antonio vitorino , in cooperation with commission president romano prodi - calls for a campaign to promote " the legitimacy , image and role of the union . "
" a true eu communication method can not be limited to mere diffusion of information : it must give a sense to things and put the eu 's actions and policies in perspective . ...
experience shows that information can not remain neutral because of the constant distortion by the media , intermediaries and other multipliers of opinion , " the plan stated .
the document , titled " an information and communication strategy for the european union , " called for better coordination between three main eu institutions : the council , commission and parliament .
the eu already has some 700 information centers throughout its 15 member states .
but the report said that these have not been able to adequately influence public opinion .
putting on a friendly face the report said that leaders in the realms of business , women 's rights , and education must be recruited to speak out in favor of a united europe .
" the eu cruelly lacks a ' face ' vis-a-vis the ordinary citizens , " the report said .
the plan recommends starting a pr campaign in september by setting up focus groups in each member state and working with the public opinion research departments of each state as well .
a little-known group know as the inter-institutional information group -lrb- gii -rrb- that meets twice a year with representation from the three main eu instiutions would play a central role in defining the new pr strategy .
under the proposal , the new pr program would be operational in time for expected euro referendums in britain and sweden .
new-fangled flag the proposal comes on the heels of another eu effort to add shine to its image : by redesigning the union 's flag .
star architect rem koolhaas from holland was asked by prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt to suggest a new flag .
the result is a bar code-like multicolored image was created by blending all the colors of the national flags of eu nations .
if adopted , the flag would replace the current one which features 12 stars on a blue background .
the current flag was adoped in 1986 , when each star was meant to represent a member state .
as the eu has grown - and with new members in sight - the flag has become outdated .
koolhaas , meanwhile , was also present at a recent round-table discussion that included 12 top european thinkers and executives including author umberto eco and swatch inventor nicolas hayek .
among other recommendations coming out of this meeting were the creation of multi-lingual schools and partnerships between brussels and european businesses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for a european constitution french and german leaders are meeting in nantes today for a one-day summit on the future of the european union .

arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .

the proposal , outlined in a 50-page plan that was leaked to the media ahead of the meetings , calls for spending 267 million euros -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- over the next four years to improve citizen understanding of the eu .
campaign to promote legitimacy the document - prepared by the eu commissioner for justice and home affairs , antonio vitorino , in cooperation with commission president romano prodi - calls for a campaign to promote " the legitimacy , image and role of the union . "
" a true eu communication method can not be limited to mere diffusion of information : it must give a sense to things and put the eu 's actions and policies in perspective . ...
experience shows that information can not remain neutral because of the constant distortion by the media , intermediaries and other multipliers of opinion , " the plan stated .
the document , titled " an information and communication strategy for the european union , " called for better coordination between three main eu institutions : the council , commission and parliament .
the eu already has some 700 information centers throughout its 15 member states .
but the report said that these have not been able to adequately influence public opinion .
putting on a friendly face the report said that leaders in the realms of business , women 's rights , and education must be recruited to speak out in favor of a united europe .
" the eu cruelly lacks a ' face ' vis-a-vis the ordinary citizens , " the report said .
the plan recommends starting a pr campaign in september by setting up focus groups in each member state and working with the public opinion research departments of each state as well .
a little-known group know as the inter-institutional information group -lrb- gii -rrb- that meets twice a year with representation from the three main eu instiutions would play a central role in defining the new pr strategy .
under the proposal , the new pr program would be operational in time for expected euro referendums in britain and sweden .
new-fangled flag the proposal comes on the heels of another eu effort to add shine to its image : by redesigning the union 's flag .
star architect rem koolhaas from holland was asked by prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt to suggest a new flag .
the result is a bar code-like multicolored image was created by blending all the colors of the national flags of eu nations .
if adopted , the flag would replace the current one which features 12 stars on a blue background .
the current flag was adoped in 1986 , when each star was meant to represent a member state .
as the eu has grown - and with new members in sight - the flag has become outdated .
koolhaas , meanwhile , was also present at a recent round-table discussion that included 12 top european thinkers and executives including author umberto eco and swatch inventor nicolas hayek .
among other recommendations coming out of this meeting were the creation of multi-lingual schools and partnerships between brussels and european businesses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for a european constitution french and german leaders are meeting in nantes today for a one-day summit on the future of the european union .

it may prove yet another fatal blow to nature in europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
so much so , that virus ’ have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18 000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
there are now fresh signs that this nightmare may see an unwelcomed revival .
repetition of a nightmare the first dead seals to have been discovered with the lethal virus since 1989 were discovered earlier this year in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
it is an exact repetition of the virus ’ first showing up , 14 years ago .
as the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs , infections with bacteria follow .
parasites spread easily to other body organs .
the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
the origins of pdv are still a mystery .
but also why it has befallen anholt for the second time , too .
scientists say it may have been carried to the area by a single animal from the open sea , or could have its origins in waste water from nearby mink farms .
one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
already , local administration is bracing itself .

one thing , however is sure : the seals here do not have the necessary antibodies .
indeed , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic .
driven to far waters in 1900 , 37 000 seals lived in the north sea ’ s mud flats .
1988 's epidemic was the first to have been reported since then .
scientists believe the first epidemic was sparked by arctic seals , looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat , suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing .
arctic seals may look much like their north german counterparts .
but they have one – vital – difference : arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus .
without the necessary antibodies , and in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
even the discovery of a serum , sparking fresh hopes , has proved no remedy .
as the serum must be injected into muscle tissue , it would only be of help at seal stations .
injecting 20 000 seals in open nature is practically impossible .
no natural selection the animal front is becoming increasingly divided by the discussion over the virus .
some say the virus is natural selection .
others , such as those at the national park in tönningen , say seals ’ normal natural selection follows the classic hunter-prey situation : is fish in abundance , then the seal population grows .
is fish scarce , then females do not reproduce .
the fishing industry says the size of the seal population has grown up to 20 000 animals .
if this was so , experts point out , the seals would both be leaner , and more prone to illness .
however , this is not the case .
the animals are all in a healthy condition , there are no signs of over-population , and therefore no obvious need to decimate the group .
weakened by pollution what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
already , local administration is bracing itself .
however , local crisis management is reduced largely to one thing : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a u.s. federal bureau of investigation report released in may noted that terrorists and their weapons had successfully infiltrated the country concealed in shipping containers .
in a preemptive measure to stop any further terrorists from getting into the country , u.s. customs service experts are currently cooperating with european port authorities in france , belgium and holland .
u.s. government officials are also negotiating with berlin to extend the cooperation to german harbors .
germany 's federal ministry of finance , which is responsible for customs regulations , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the countries are currently negotiating an increased cooperative relationship .
however , a spokesman for the ministry said no agreement has been reached yet .
stepped up security in the aftermath of september 11 , american politicians proposed providing customs inspectors at ports with additional training to help them ferret out containers that might be storing chemical or biological weapons .
they are also seeking to send inspectors to facilities abroad , including those in europe .
new x-ray scanners , which cost $ 10 million -lrb- 10.15 million euro -rrb- a piece , can penetrate even densely packed containers and can be programmed to detect explosive or radioactive materials .
u.s. customs has also developed software that can flag suspicious cargo based on its origin and route .
a trend towards european cooperation the u.s. has already secured permission to station specially trained american customs officials in three large european ports in the coming weeks .
the agreement , announced last week , will first involve the ports of rotterdam in the netherlands , antwerp in belgium and le havre in france .
rotterdam , the world ’ s largest seaport , was the first european harbor to agree to the arrangement .
rotterdam already has its own system in place for risk analysis of the more than 400 million containers that pass through in a year .
rotterdam 's europoort will now buttress its own program by adding u.s. expertise and the u.s. customs database .
officials are optimistic about the cooperation .
" we 're basically fine-tuning the system , " renee wesdorp , a spokeswoman for dutch customs told the new york times .
" we 'll start with a six-month pilot project and then see if it 's useful to continue . "
finding a needle in a haystack if german officials agree to participate , the most likely test port would be bremerhaven , located near the northern german city bremen .
there , customs inspectors face the same challenges as their american counterparts .
at bremerhaven , inspectors have the overall capacity to inspect only one percent of the containers being processed , der spiegel reported .
while the american government continues to allocate special funding to increase port security , german customs officials still operate on tighter budgets .
officials at bremerhaven fear that adding additional freight to the volume it already checks could dramatically increase costs and reduce the port 's competitiveness .
mainly exchange of information " what it ’ s going to amount to is mainly an exchange of information , " arne petrick , a customs officer in hamburg , told der spiegel .
but petrick told the magazine it was unlikely the u.s. would be permitted to partake in actual patrols at german harbors because of germany 's strict tax secrecy laws , which forbid making data about the contents of freight available to third parties .
additionally , the two countries will have to negotiate how to fund the increase in personnel and equipment upgrades cooperation would require .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2002 apartheid lawsuit extends to german banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is a target of the lawsuit an american lawyer is adding three german banks to a class action suit seeking reparations for victims of apartheid in south africa .
but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .

" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .

in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .

germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2002 apartheid lawsuit extends to german banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is a target of the lawsuit an american lawyer is adding three german banks to a class action suit seeking reparations for victims of apartheid in south africa .
but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .
khulumani has filed a suit against president thabo mbeki seeking a copy of the government ’ s draft reparations policy in advance of the official release date . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "

the proposal , outlined in a 50-page plan that was leaked to the media ahead of the meetings , calls for spending 267 million euros -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- over the next four years to improve citizen understanding of the eu .
campaign to promote legitimacy the document - prepared by the eu commissioner for justice and home affairs , antonio vitorino , in cooperation with commission president romano prodi - calls for a campaign to promote " the legitimacy , image and role of the union . "
" a true eu communication method can not be limited to mere diffusion of information : it must give a sense to things and put the eu 's actions and policies in perspective . ...
experience shows that information can not remain neutral because of the constant distortion by the media , intermediaries and other multipliers of opinion , " the plan stated .
the document , titled " an information and communication strategy for the european union , " called for better coordination between three main eu institutions : the council , commission and parliament .
the eu already has some 700 information centers throughout its 15 member states .
but the report said that these have not been able to adequately influence public opinion .
putting on a friendly face the report said that leaders in the realms of business , women 's rights , and education must be recruited to speak out in favor of a united europe .
" the eu cruelly lacks a ' face ' vis-a-vis the ordinary citizens , " the report said .
the plan recommends starting a pr campaign in september by setting up focus groups in each member state and working with the public opinion research departments of each state as well .
a little-known group know as the inter-institutional information group -lrb- gii -rrb- that meets twice a year with representation from the three main eu instiutions would play a central role in defining the new pr strategy .
under the proposal , the new pr program would be operational in time for expected euro referendums in britain and sweden .
new-fangled flag the proposal comes on the heels of another eu effort to add shine to its image : by redesigning the union 's flag .
star architect rem koolhaas from holland was asked by prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt to suggest a new flag .
the result is a bar code-like multicolored image was created by blending all the colors of the national flags of eu nations .
if adopted , the flag would replace the current one which features 12 stars on a blue background .
the current flag was adoped in 1986 , when each star was meant to represent a member state .
as the eu has grown - and with new members in sight - the flag has become outdated .
koolhaas , meanwhile , was also present at a recent round-table discussion that included 12 top european thinkers and executives including author umberto eco and swatch inventor nicolas hayek .
among other recommendations coming out of this meeting were the creation of multi-lingual schools and partnerships between brussels and european businesses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for a european constitution french and german leaders are meeting in nantes today for a one-day summit on the future of the european union .

but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .

the proposal , outlined in a 50-page plan that was leaked to the media ahead of the meetings , calls for spending 267 million euros -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- over the next four years to improve citizen understanding of the eu .
campaign to promote legitimacy the document - prepared by the eu commissioner for justice and home affairs , antonio vitorino , in cooperation with commission president romano prodi - calls for a campaign to promote " the legitimacy , image and role of the union . "
" a true eu communication method can not be limited to mere diffusion of information : it must give a sense to things and put the eu 's actions and policies in perspective . ...
experience shows that information can not remain neutral because of the constant distortion by the media , intermediaries and other multipliers of opinion , " the plan stated .
the document , titled " an information and communication strategy for the european union , " called for better coordination between three main eu institutions : the council , commission and parliament .
the eu already has some 700 information centers throughout its 15 member states .
but the report said that these have not been able to adequately influence public opinion .
putting on a friendly face the report said that leaders in the realms of business , women 's rights , and education must be recruited to speak out in favor of a united europe .
" the eu cruelly lacks a ' face ' vis-a-vis the ordinary citizens , " the report said .
the plan recommends starting a pr campaign in september by setting up focus groups in each member state and working with the public opinion research departments of each state as well .
a little-known group know as the inter-institutional information group -lrb- gii -rrb- that meets twice a year with representation from the three main eu instiutions would play a central role in defining the new pr strategy .

but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .

but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .
rights groups worried about confusion the german banks have so far refused to comment on the details .
the swiss institutes have already dismissed the action as " preposterous " .
south african victims ' groups have also raised concerns .
thandi shezi of the khulumani victims ’ rights group told reuters news agency that fagan 's suit was inspiring false hope among apartheid victims .
a toll-free number fagan 's group set up for those willing to join the class-action lawsuit has confused victims into thinking restitution will come quick .
many do n't understand that the suit faces tall hurdles and wo n't be decided on any time soon .
" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .
shezi fears that some might turn to fagan 's class action suit , thinking it is a quicker fix .
germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .
in truth , however , the parallel requires a stretch of the imagination .
the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .
with no single government to strike a deal with , it is unlikely that firms innocent of any links to the apartheid regime will be willing to put money into the reparations pot like they did in germany .
in addition , a feeling of collective guilt still surrounds the nazi past in germany , but there ’ s little reason for companies to harbour the same sentiment about south africa .
reparations an urgent issue the khulumani group is holding community meetings in soweto and other areas to explain the implications of fagan ’ s suit , which is fueling impatience on the reparations issue .
only last week , standard bank chief economist iraj abedian told journalists that payments were crucial to preserving social and economic stability .
khulumani has filed a suit against president thabo mbeki seeking a copy of the government ’ s draft reparations policy in advance of the official release date . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

at bremerhaven , inspectors have the overall capacity to inspect only one percent of the containers being processed , der spiegel reported .
while the american government continues to allocate special funding to increase port security , german customs officials still operate on tighter budgets .
officials at bremerhaven fear that adding additional freight to the volume it already checks could dramatically increase costs and reduce the port 's competitiveness .
mainly exchange of information " what it ’ s going to amount to is mainly an exchange of information , " arne petrick , a customs officer in hamburg , told der spiegel .
but petrick told the magazine it was unlikely the u.s. would be permitted to partake in actual patrols at german harbors because of germany 's strict tax secrecy laws , which forbid making data about the contents of freight available to third parties .
additionally , the two countries will have to negotiate how to fund the increase in personnel and equipment upgrades cooperation would require .
a vulnerable position fears of terrorists stowing away on freighter ships are well grounded .

the proposal , outlined in a 50-page plan that was leaked to the media ahead of the meetings , calls for spending 267 million euros -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- over the next four years to improve citizen understanding of the eu .
campaign to promote legitimacy the document - prepared by the eu commissioner for justice and home affairs , antonio vitorino , in cooperation with commission president romano prodi - calls for a campaign to promote " the legitimacy , image and role of the union . "
" a true eu communication method can not be limited to mere diffusion of information : it must give a sense to things and put the eu 's actions and policies in perspective . ...
experience shows that information can not remain neutral because of the constant distortion by the media , intermediaries and other multipliers of opinion , " the plan stated .
the document , titled " an information and communication strategy for the european union , " called for better coordination between three main eu institutions : the council , commission and parliament .
the eu already has some 700 information centers throughout its 15 member states .
but the report said that these have not been able to adequately influence public opinion .
putting on a friendly face the report said that leaders in the realms of business , women 's rights , and education must be recruited to speak out in favor of a united europe .
" the eu cruelly lacks a ' face ' vis-a-vis the ordinary citizens , " the report said .
the plan recommends starting a pr campaign in september by setting up focus groups in each member state and working with the public opinion research departments of each state as well .
a little-known group know as the inter-institutional information group -lrb- gii -rrb- that meets twice a year with representation from the three main eu instiutions would play a central role in defining the new pr strategy .
under the proposal , the new pr program would be operational in time for expected euro referendums in britain and sweden .
new-fangled flag the proposal comes on the heels of another eu effort to add shine to its image : by redesigning the union 's flag .
star architect rem koolhaas from holland was asked by prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt to suggest a new flag .
the result is a bar code-like multicolored image was created by blending all the colors of the national flags of eu nations .
if adopted , the flag would replace the current one which features 12 stars on a blue background .
the current flag was adoped in 1986 , when each star was meant to represent a member state .
as the eu has grown - and with new members in sight - the flag has become outdated .
koolhaas , meanwhile , was also present at a recent round-table discussion that included 12 top european thinkers and executives including author umberto eco and swatch inventor nicolas hayek .
among other recommendations coming out of this meeting were the creation of multi-lingual schools and partnerships between brussels and european businesses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for a european constitution french and german leaders are meeting in nantes today for a one-day summit on the future of the european union .

but some victims ’ rights activists are criticizing the move . us lawyer ed fagan , who pressed swiss banks into compensating relatives of holocaust survivors , has set his bespectacled sights on pressuring swiss , us and german banks into paying billions to victims of south africa 's apartheid regime .
the 51 billion euro us-based class action lawsuit was originally announced last month and encompassed swiss banks credit suisse and ubs along with the u.s.-based citigroup .
now , germany ’ s deutsche bank , dresdner bank and commerzbank are being added – along with computer giant ibm .
the banks are accused of loaning billions to the apartheid regime at a time when international economic sanctions against south africa were in place .
fagan included ibm because the company supplied technology and equipment to south africa during white minority rule .
" business was central to the economy that sustained the south african state during the apartheid years , " fagan said according to the guardian newspaper .

" some people think if they call the number and wait one or two months , the money will come , " said shezi .
" we have told them it could take five or six years . "
in addition , shezi said some people believed the suit was replacing state compensation recommended by south africa ’ s own truth and reconciliation commission -lrb- trc -rrb- .
the commission decided in 1998 that some 300 million euro should be given to more than 21,000 victims of the apartheid regime that was dismantled in the early 1990 ’ s .
but the government has been slow in paying that money out until the commission finalizes its draft reparations policy this august .

germans may see parallels im germany , the case could remind some people of the u.s. class action taken against german companies by survivors of the nazis ’ forced labor policy during wwii .

the lawsuit waged by former foreign laborers targeted german firms exclusively and led to a deal with the berlin government , granting the victims about 2.5 billion euro in reparation .
that agreement is supported by german companies ’ voluntary donations to a special fund .
the apartheid case , on the other hand , already involves companies from three countries – and fagan has warned that other firms may be drawn in .

jean marie messier born grenoble , 1956 vivendi chief executive and chairman 1994 - general partner , lazard freres 1989 - 1994 french economy ministry official 1982 - 1988 ecole nationale d 'administration 1980 - 1982 mr messier held a variety of senior roles in the french economy ministry during the 1980s before going into investment banking .
he took over as head of the staid utility group compagnie generale des eaux in 1994 .
he immediately set about transforming the 150 year old company , whose core activities were refuse collection and running sewage plants , into nothing less than a global media and telecommunications giant .
it was an audacious gamble , typical of mr messier 's flamboyance , and on paper at least , he pulled it off .
growing pains within six short years , the business had been renamed vivendi universal , and , thanks to a wave of acquisitions , ranked as the world 's second biggest media company after aol time warner .
the company 's subsidiaries included the hollywood film studio universal , its affiliated record label universal music , and french pay tv station canal plus .
in europe , vivendi also owned mobile telecom services , theme parks , educational publishing businesses , and , of course , its original french utility operations .
the scale of the transformation that mr messier had brought about won him many plaudits in france , where business leaders rarely display such unabashed global ambitions .
french commentators joked that on dying , mr messier would ascend to the pearly gates to inform st peter that he had bought out heaven itself .
the colourful chief executive , still in his early 40s , became known as j6m , short for jean marie messier , moi meme maitre du monde -lrb- master of the world . -rrb-
boom to bust ?
there was one small problem , however .
vivendi 's unprecedented expansion had been fuelled largely by buy-outs , and , as economic growth began to falter , concerns that the company had paid over the odds for its acquisitions began to mount .
at the same time , resentment over mr messier 's brash style , which had always irked the more conservative french commentators , began to drown out the earlier plaudits .
mr messier 's decision to relocate to new york , where he took up residence in a 20 million euro -lrb- £ 12.9m ; $ 19.8m -rrb- apartment paid for by the company , did not help matters .
more controversial still was his remark late last year that " the french cultural exception is dead , " widely interpreted as a condemnation of government subsidies for french art and culture .
this caused uproar in france , where the government 's policy of funding the domestic film and music industries is widely seen as an essential bulwark against the global dominance of anglophone entertainment media .
financial pressure back in the boardroom , things went from bad to worse .
in march , vivendi universal unveiled a 13.6bn euro loss for 2001 , weighed down by a colossal downward revision in the value of its assets .
the news unnerved investors , who marked the company 's shares down by about 60 % during the first half of this year .
the day before his resignation , the company 's stock surged on exepctations of his imminent departure , a sign that the markets saw him as a liability .
political pressure while vivendi 's deteriorating financial performance seems to be the main reason for mr messier 's fall from grace , there may be more to it than that .
mr messier , a graduate of the prestigious ecole nationale d 'administration , and a holder of the legion d 'honneur , is a fully paid up member of the french elite .
however , he was widely seen as an ally of former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , who lost out to centre-right rival jacques chirac in the country 's presidential elections earlier this year .
given the close ties between the upper echelons of government and business in france , mr chirac 's election victory is likely to have done mr messier no favours at all .

by myles neligan bbc news online business staff with the resignation of vivendi universal boss jean marie messier , france has lost by far its most colourful and controversial business leader .
jean marie messier born grenoble , 1956 vivendi chief executive and chairman 1994 - general partner , lazard freres 1989 - 1994 french economy ministry official 1982 - 1988 ecole nationale d 'administration 1980 - 1982 mr messier held a variety of senior roles in the french economy ministry during the 1980s before going into investment banking .
he took over as head of the staid utility group compagnie generale des eaux in 1994 .
he immediately set about transforming the 150 year old company , whose core activities were refuse collection and running sewage plants , into nothing less than a global media and telecommunications giant .
it was an audacious gamble , typical of mr messier 's flamboyance , and on paper at least , he pulled it off .
growing pains within six short years , the business had been renamed vivendi universal , and , thanks to a wave of acquisitions , ranked as the world 's second biggest media company after aol time warner .
the company 's subsidiaries included the hollywood film studio universal , its affiliated record label universal music , and french pay tv station canal plus .
in europe , vivendi also owned mobile telecom services , theme parks , educational publishing businesses , and , of course , its original french utility operations .
the scale of the transformation that mr messier had brought about won him many plaudits in france , where business leaders rarely display such unabashed global ambitions .
french commentators joked that on dying , mr messier would ascend to the pearly gates to inform st peter that he had bought out heaven itself .
the colourful chief executive , still in his early 40s , became known as j6m , short for jean marie messier , moi meme maitre du monde -lrb- master of the world . -rrb-
boom to bust ?
there was one small problem , however .
vivendi 's unprecedented expansion had been fuelled largely by buy-outs , and , as economic growth began to falter , concerns that the company had paid over the odds for its acquisitions began to mount .
at the same time , resentment over mr messier 's brash style , which had always irked the more conservative french commentators , began to drown out the earlier plaudits .
mr messier 's decision to relocate to new york , where he took up residence in a 20 million euro -lrb- £ 12.9m ; $ 19.8m -rrb- apartment paid for by the company , did not help matters .
more controversial still was his remark late last year that " the french cultural exception is dead , " widely interpreted as a condemnation of government subsidies for french art and culture .
this caused uproar in france , where the government 's policy of funding the domestic film and music industries is widely seen as an essential bulwark against the global dominance of anglophone entertainment media .
financial pressure back in the boardroom , things went from bad to worse .
in march , vivendi universal unveiled a 13.6bn euro loss for 2001 , weighed down by a colossal downward revision in the value of its assets .
the news unnerved investors , who marked the company 's shares down by about 60 % during the first half of this year .
the day before his resignation , the company 's stock surged on exepctations of his imminent departure , a sign that the markets saw him as a liability .
political pressure while vivendi 's deteriorating financial performance seems to be the main reason for mr messier 's fall from grace , there may be more to it than that .
mr messier , a graduate of the prestigious ecole nationale d 'administration , and a holder of the legion d 'honneur , is a fully paid up member of the french elite .
however , he was widely seen as an ally of former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , who lost out to centre-right rival jacques chirac in the country 's presidential elections earlier this year .
given the close ties between the upper echelons of government and business in france , mr chirac 's election victory is likely to have done mr messier no favours at all .

the aurora is due to set sail again for countries where abortion is forbidden .
it will dock in international waters and members of women on waves will offer advice and treatment to women who come on board .
the group sparked a storm of protest from pro-life activists last year when they docked off the coast of ireland , where the practice of abortion is illegal .
the first stop for the aurora - sometimes known as the sea of change - will probably be back to ireland , from where 6,000 women travel to england for abortions each year .
the dutch health minister , els borst , said the decision to allow women on waves to give out the abortion pill was in line with government policy regarding the sexual independence of women .
women on waves are allowed to offer the drug to terminate pregnancies of up to six weeks , provided a gynaecologist is present .
however the group say they will appeal against the decision in the hope of being able to offer clinical abortions to women who are up to three months pregnant .
the world health organization estimates that 100,000 women die each year from illegal back-street abortions .

china 's huge mining industry has a poor safety record with more than 3,000 deaths reported in the past six months alone .
china has recently ordered illegal mines to close , but this is not in the interests of the local authorities , who rely on the mines ' revenue .
analysts say that the government 's pledge to jail the officials responsible for poor safety may actually lead to more accidents going unreported .

the new closures will leave china with about 15,000 mines , down from 82,000 in 1997 .

the train suffered little damage and there was no damage to the track .

the restructuring has been excruciating vasan shridharan , economist hsbc singapore the vocabulary of economic crisis appears to have become even more hackneyed and overused in the intervening five years .
but when the government of thailand devalued its currency , the baht , on 2 july 1997 , its effect was real and immediate .
hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs - many have still to be regained - local currencies plunged in value and businesses shut down .
first quarter gdp south korea : 5.7 % thailand : 3.9 % indonesia : 2.5 % taiwan : 0.9 % singapore : -1.7 % china : 7.6 % malaysia : 1.1 % philippines : 3.8 % percentage change on year earlier source : economist the ' managed float ' was one of the first of a series of events that together became known as the asian economic crisis .
five years on , many of these economies are growing again , in part because their cheaper currencies made their exports more competitive .
in countries throughout the region - led by south korea - domestic demand is picking up , reducing the reliance on exports .
but the effects of the crisis are still felt , with many businesses and governments behaving very differently to how they did in 1997 .
where it began during the 1990s , foreign investment had been pouring into thailand , attracted by cheap labour for assembly plants .
bangkok was growing , stoking a property and stock market boom , which was largely financed by money borrowed in us dollars .
these workers at hyundai feared job losses but the size of the country 's current account deficit led many to believe the currency was overvalued , encouraging investors to quickly swap any thai baht earned back into dollars .
speculators moved in and with few reserves to defend its currency , the thai authorities gave in and allowed the currency to plummet .
speculators began to move from one currency to the next .
the crisis moved quickly and within months the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had to provide bail-outs for thailand , south korea and indonesia .
the imf money came with conditions , aimed at shaking new life into corporate asia , new rigour into its economic management the crisis did expose several fault lines running through asian economies - namely a reliance on short term debt , burgeoning current account deficits , poor corporate legislation , an unwieldy and inefficient banking sector .
and it was these problems that the imf wanted the region to address .
unmasking a crisis falling currencies meant that many companies found themselves unable to pay their dollar debts , increasing the weight of bad debts that the region 's banks were already saddled with .
" many of the companies that looked to be fundamentally strong were unmasked by the asian crisis , " vasan shridharan , economist at hsbc singapore said .
the restructuring required " has been excruciating " , he added .
much of asian business life appears to have been a complicated web of relationships , not just with creditors and clients , but also within the families that ran the business .
many were reluctant to bring outsiders in .
in any crisis , it is hard to see any clear winner .
everyone feels very much the loser claudio piron , standard chartered " we have -lsb- since the crisis -rsb- also seen second and third generation families , thinking that for the long term success of the company , we need to consider flotation ... bringing in other investors , " standard chartered 's head of foreign exchange strategy claudio piron said .
in some countries the change has been more dramatic than others .
an estimated 34 % of the south korean equity market is owned by foreigners , piron points out .
" before the crisis , there were 30 chaebol -lsb- huge conglomerates -rsb- , now there are about 16 .
they had 2,100 financial institutions , now there are 1,600 ... crazy numbers , " piron said .
many people were angered by the intervention of international agencies pradumna rana , director of the asian development bank 's regional economic monitoring unit in manila agrees that " the economic and financial landscape in east asia five years after the crisis is quite different " .
degrees of change but while reforms and new legislation - such as bankruptcy laws - have been introduced , the actual practice of change has proved harder .
the fear of further change is linked by many to fear of greater poverty - as restructuring often leads to job losses .
hsbc 's vasan shridharan points out that - with the exception of south korea - the region 's unemployment rate is higher than the average for the previous 10 years .
even in south korea , where the recovery has been strongest , there is " a degree of disappointment that a lot of foreign companies and banks bought in at the lows " , standard chartered 's claudio piron said .
" a lot of foreign investors are sitting on substantial gains .
a lot of koreans are saying we have borne all the hardship and yet the foreigners have gained . "
his view is that " both -lsb- sides -rsb- are unhappy with the deal they got .
" in any crisis , it is hard to see any clear winner .
everyone feels very much the loser . "
the handling of the crisis has prompted a rethinking of the role of international agencies that is still ongoing .
" there has been a lot of soul searching since then , particularly with indonesia , the whole crisis plunged a third of the population into poverty , " mr piron said .
the adb 's pradumna rana voices cautious optimism .
these countries " have built up a cushion to prevent future crises , the current account is relatively comfortable , reserve levels are fairly high in the region .
" in a globalising world , we do n't know -lsb- where the next shocks could come from -rsb- the shocks could be good as well as bad .

around 100 workers at the caparo natural gas tubes plant at tredegar said the action would go ahead on tuesday afternoon unless an agreement with the management is reached .
the industrial action follows caparo 's decision to replace its final salary pension scheme with a new system based on stock market performance .
the action to defend pension rights is the first of its kind in the uk .
the caparo group , owned by labour peer lord paul , is one of the uk 's largest steel businesses with branches in scunthorpe , tredegar , walsall and wrexham .
the north east wales workers are also voting to decide whether or not to ban overtime .
the results of that ballot are due be disclosed at the end of this week .
the tredegar workers are angry their pension scheme is being replaced for both new and existing members .
modest incomes workers at the company 's scunthorpe plant carried out an overtime ban last friday , ahead of the proposed action at tredegar on tuesday .
stakeholder pensions were launched in april last year as a low-cost way for those earning modest incomes to save for retirement , and ease the burden on state coffers .
like other pension plans , money paid into a stakeholder pension is invested in items such as stocks and shares , bonds and cash savings accounts .
however , istc members in scunthorpe and tredegar opposed to the plans have already voted to take strike action if caparo refuse to comply with union wishes .
the union wants caparo to suspend the scheme and meet the union to discuss other options .
poor markets michael leahy , istc general secretary , said caparo workers are " outraged " that their security in retirement is being threatened .
" istc members at caparo face the prospect of a much reduced income after years of service than that which they expected , " he said .
an increasing number of companies have closed their final salary pension schemes over the last few years , blaming poorly-performing stock markets , punitive taxation and a new accounting standard .
a recent poll revealed plans by a quarter of small firms to wind-up or close schemes within the next year .
in their place , companies are offering riskier schemes , known as " money purchase " plans , which pass on the investment risk to the worker .

with corporate earnings remaining stubbornly in the doldrums despite signs of an economic upturn , an eerie hush has settled across the city 's once hectic trading floors and boardrooms .
the outlook , unless it 's addressed , is extremely bleak .
some radical action needs to be taken if we 're to tackle this increasing problem .
ken farrow even the lunchtime crowds in the square mile 's wine bars and restaurants are thinner than usual .
but amidst the calm , one little-known corner of the uk 's financial hub is as busy as ever .
" you have peaks and troughs , and usually in the troughs we know we 're going to get some blockbuster cases , " says detective superintendent ken farrow , head of the city of london police fraud squad .
mr farrow , for the last five years head of the british police service 's biggest anti-fraud unit , has had ample opportunity to observe the corrupting effect of economic downturns .
" once credit lines start to tighten up , organisations come under pressure , and the directors of those organisations can come closer to crossing that white line , " mr farrow says .
words of warning mr farrow 's warning over the correlation between corporate fraud and economic slumps carries extra weight in the light of the recent financial scandals at enron and worldcom in the us .
the two us corporate giants ' disregard for normal accounting rules , which helped boost their share prices during the 1990s boom , only came to light after last year 's global economic downturn began to bite into their earnings .
enron and worldcom 's fall from grace , together with allegations of insider dealing and tax-dodging at a string of other respected us companies , have dealt a serious blow to investor confidence in corporate america .
this loss of faith is now a major factor in the persistent weakness of the us stock market , and could even prolong the original economic slowdown .
while corporate skulduggery on this scale has yet to be detected in the uk , mr farrow stresses that fraud is a major and growing problem here too .
cover up " -lsb- fraud -rsb- in the uk is serious .
it is becoming a real concern , " he says .
the city : fraud a growing threat the cost of corporate fraud is thought to run as high as £ 14bn a year , although mr farrow believes that even this estimate is conservative .
frauds in the city of london range from attempts by conmen to raise bank loans using phoney securities as collateral , to orchestrated internal scams such as robert maxwell 's plundering of the mirror group pension funds .
but firms ' reluctance to report fraud , especially when it has been carried out by insiders , makes it difficult to gauge the full extent of the problem .
recent research by corporate investigations agency risk advisory group suggests that british companies ' first instinct is to cover up internal scams so as to avoid bad publicity .
the research , based on a study of 50 recent cases , also found that senior executives were involved in nearly three-quarters of frauds worth in excess of £ 1m .
villains and there is anecdotal evidence that professional criminals , who have realised that there are fewer checks on fraud than on their more traditional activities , are increasingly targeting city institutions .
" from a criminal perspective , -lsb- corporate fraud -rsb- is seen as highly rewarding , low risk , and has therefore become the most productive way of diversifying their business , " says mr farrow .
st paul 's : targeted by fraudsters in a recent high-profile case , mr farrow 's men helped to foil a plot to defraud st paul 's cathedral of £ 100m by convincing it to put money in a bogus investment scheme .
he warns that the situation can only get worse unless the uk 's under-resourced network of anti-fraud agencies is beefed up and brought under a greater degree of centralised control .
" the outlook , unless it 's addressed , is extremely bleak .
some radical action needs to be taken if we 're to tackle this increasing problem . "
fragmented responsibility for bringing corporate fraudsters to book is shared between a number of different organisations in the uk .
the financial services authority and the department of trade and industry investigate mainstream corporate frauds , while the serious fraud office tackles the most lucrative and complex cases .
however , staffing constraints usually force these agencies to rely on officers seconded from police forces to carry out their enquiries .
and many police chiefs , under intense pressure to crack down on high-profile crimes such as street robbery and drug trafficking , are reluctant to divert officers to fraud investigations .
" in the last couple of years , there has been a downward spiral in the number of officers that the police can devote to this kind of investigation , " mr farrow says .
mr farrow 's own unit , charged with policing a financial district where over 300,000 people work , has just 65 full-time officers .
under resourced mr farrow is in favour of setting up a national fraud squad , which he says would need to be staffed by 1,200 full-time investigators in order to make a significant difference .
the squad , which would probably be amalgamated with the serious fraud office , would also help define a national strategy for dealing with corporate fraud .
the proposal was discussed by a working group made up of senior figures from all the major fraudbusting agencies earlier this year .
however , in the absence of fresh funding commitments from the government , and with regional police forces continuing to resist moves to divert officers from mainstream duties , the talks came to nothing .
" the indication i 'm getting is that there is no prospect of getting a national fraud squad in the foreseeable future , " mr farrow said .
public concern a veteran of the mirror group investigation who talks more like a banker or an accountant than a policeman , mr farrow adds that most people underestimate the impact of corporate fraud .
he believes that the lack of political will to tackle corporate fraud stems in part from the public 's relatively relaxed attitude to white-collar crime , which is widely seen as victimless .
" but the public should be concerned , " he stresses .
" every single one of us who works and pays taxes are paying huge amounts annually through higher insurance premiums to cover the losses . "

the cartoon video for shoot the dog also features a scene in which the singer , dressed in a leopard-print thong , apparently tries to seduce cherie blair . "
i am definitely not anti-american , how could i be , i have been in love with a texan for six years and we are still going strong " george michael michael said he had begun writing the song before the us attacks on 11 september , but because of its political nature he had delayed its release until 12 august .
the new release follows a furore over michael 's video for his last single , freeek .
the broadcasting standards commission criticised bbc one for broadcasting it before 9pm on top of the pops , because of its sexual imagery .
michael said that shoot the dog was motivated by his concern about the lack of public consultation over president bush 's " war on terror " .
" on an issue as enormous as the possible bombing of iraq , how can you represent us when you have n't asked us what we think ?
" and let 's be honest , we have n't even begun to discuss it as a society , " said michael .
shoot the dog lampoons the two leaders by depicting them dancing the tango , with mr blair in a flowing dress .
it also depicts mr blair as the captain of a ship in the shape of britain sailing ever closer to the us , but without realising he is still moored to europe .
michael said he was concerned about the growing relationship between the prime minister and president bush .

the cartoon video for shoot the dog also features a scene in which the singer , dressed in a leopard-print thong , apparently tries to seduce cherie blair .
i am definitely not anti-american , how could i be , i have been in love with a texan for six years and we are still going strong george michael michael said he had begun writing the song before the us attacks on 11 september , but because of its political nature he had delayed its release until 12 august .
the new release follows a furore over michael 's video for his last single , freeek .
the broadcasting standards commission criticised bbc one for broadcasting it before 9pm on top of the pops , because of its sexual imagery .
cherie blair also features in the video michael said that shoot the dog was motivated by his concern about the lack of public consultation over president bush 's " war on terror " .
" on an issue as enormous as the possible bombing of iraq , how can you represent us when you have n't asked us what we think ?
" and let 's be honest , we have n't even begun to discuss it as a society , " said michael .
shoot the dog lampoons the two leaders by depicting them dancing the tango , with mr blair in a flowing dress .
it also depicts mr blair as the captain of a ship in the shape of britain sailing ever closer to the us , but without realising he is still moored to europe .
michael said he was concerned about the growing relationship between the prime minister and president bush .
" do n't get me wrong , i am definitely not anti-american , how could i be , i have been in love with a texan for six years and we are still going strong , " he said .

the royal family are satirised but he also said he was " under no illusions " his comments were anything more than that of a pop star .

twenty-five years ago computers were big and capable only of very simple word processing and basic spreadsheets .
by contrast the pc of today allows users to send e-mails and instant messages , browse the internet and even manage the household budget .
wearable computers are already available and in the future you may even be wearing your computer or have it embedded in your eyes .
" in 25 years ' time the pc will have disappeared .
it is a temporary artefact of low technology , " said bt futurologist ian pearson .
" in the future , displays could be put directly on to retinas with lasers implanted straight into the eye .
" the processing power of computers will be in every object in the environment .
there will even be smart dust . "
entertainment hub since the first commercially and widely available pc , the altair , went on sale in 1975 , entertainment has been one of the driving forces in bringing computers into homes .
while the 1970s enthusiast was limited to a black and white game of ping pong , the pc gamer of today can enjoy sophisticated 3d games with ultra-realistic backgrounds .
without computers there would be ...
no computer-generated films such as antz no cashpoint machines or credit cards no computer-based air traffic control systems no accurate predictions of weather the entertainment capacity of the modern pc does not just lie in gaming .
users can edit home movies , create digital photo albums and download music files .
intel , which powers the majority of the one billion pcs on the market today , believes computers of the future will change as drastically as they have since the early 70s .
" in 25 years ' time it probably will not be called a pc .
it will be integrated into everyday consumer goods , cars and washing machines , " said chris hogg , a spokesperson for intel .
its role in the home is likely to change from an isolated machine to a gateway to all the gadgets in the house .
fast chips " as consumer entertainment goes digital , there are more and more digital islands in the home .
the pc will link them all together , " he said .
from the intel 8080 chip used in the altair which delivered speeds of 2 mhz , to the 4.77 mhz processor that powered the ibm pc launched in 1981 , to the era of the 2.53 ghz pentium 4 , chips have got a whole lot faster .
an early ibm computer they have also got smarter and intel is now looking at incorporating a radio on every processor to allow chips to talk to each other .
while some experts have suggested that both pc penetration and processor speed will reach saturation point , intel is convinced it will continue to accelerate .
" new applications will always come along which need more performance power .
things like speech recognition and video recognition , " said mr hogg .
digital divide around one in 10 people in the world has a computer but the gulf between the digital haves and have-nots is markedly wider in the developing world .
in india there are seven million pcs compared with a population of one billion .
the massachusetts institute of technology in the us is working with the indian government to develop ultra-low-cost computers that could be available for just a few dollars and be widely deployed to unite citizens and cut down on bureaucracy .
