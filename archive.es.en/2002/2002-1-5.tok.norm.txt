bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- mullah omar ' flees on motorbike ' categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : south asia front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 5 january , 2002 , 08:32 gmt mullah omar ' flees on motorbike ' anti-taleban forces now control the country taleban militia leader mullah mohammad omar has escaped from his hideout in southern afghanistan on a motorbike , according to an afghan official .
the head of intelligence in kandahar , haji gulalai , told the bbc that all the taleban sympathisers around the area of baghran in the helmand province had surrendered to anti-taleban forces .
but the whereabouts of mullah omar - who apparently escaped with four sympathisers - are not known .
the bbc 's richard miron , who is in the afghan capital kabul , says it has not been confirmed that mullah omar was in the baghran area - and his reported escape adds to confusion about his fate .
the surrender of taleban sympathisers in the area , who were able to go free after handing over their weapons , was brokered during the last few days in negotiations with local tribal leaders .
our correspondent says their submission appears to indicate the weakness of the remnants of the taleban movement in the country .
i want the war against terrorism to continue .
this is a pledge we have made to the afghan people - to free them from terrorism hamid karzai earlier , it emerged that an american soldier had been killed in combat in afghanistan - the first us serviceman to die from hostile fire since the american military campaign that toppled the taleban regime began nearly three months ago .
he was killed during an exchange of gunfire near the town of khost in the east of the country , near the border with pakistan .
the us general in charge of the afghan campaign , tommy franks , said the soldier was part of a special forces team liaising with local tribal forces .
general franks added that his death showed the dangerous nature of mopping up operations against the taleban and their allies , osama bin laden 's al-qaeda terror network .
bin laden is accused of masterminding the 11 september suicide attacks on new york and washington that sparked the us military campaign .
afghanistan 's interim leader , hamid karzai , has committed his government to capturing mullah omar .
afghanistan 's new leader has promised to hand over mullah omar to the us " we are looking for him , mullah omar .
he is a criminal of an international standard and he should be delivered .
if the us wants him , we will deliver him to the united states , " mr karzai told the american abc news .
mr karzai also said he supported the continuing bombardment of suspected taleban and al-qaeda sites by the us .
" primarily i want the war against terrorism to continue .
this is a pledge we have made to the afghan people - to free them from terrorism , " he said .
but he cautioned : " we want our civilians not to be caught in the middle of fighting between our forces and the terrorists , or the american bombings and terrorism . "
al-qaeda compound the us says it is continuing to bomb a suspected al-qaeda compound in the khost region , near the border with pakistan .
the pakistan-based afghan islamic press news agency reported that the air strikes had killed 32 people , quoting witnesses as saying the bombing was so intense that residents had no chance to remove bodies .
the same compound was attacked in august 1998 following the bombings of us embassies in kenya and tanzania .
" it has been a place where the al-qaeda goes to regroup , " said general richard myers , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff .
he declined to describe in detail what triggered the attack , which was launched on thursday , except to say " activity " had been detected there .
tribal leaders in baghran are known to be unhappy about continued american bombing in the area , which they say has led to unnecessary civilian casualties .

the israelis have accused the authority of trying to smuggle 50 tons of iranian-made missiles and other weapons into the west bank and gaza strip on board one of its ships .
israel said its commandos had intercepted the shipment on friday in the red sea , adding that the captain and some of the crew were members of the palestinian naval police .
palestinian officials deny the allegations , accusing israel of trying to sabotage mr zinni 's attempts to broker a truce between the two sides after 15 months of violence that have left more than 1,000 dead .
mr zinni asked palestinian leader yasser arafat about the weapons shipment when the two met on friday in the west bank town of ramallah , us state department spokesman richard boucher said .
the envoy had " expressed our strong condemnation of any attempt to escalate the conflict in the region by militant groups or others , " mr boucher said .
israeli foreign minister shimon peres said mr arafat had a choice to make .
" they have to make strategic decision whether they support terrorism or they are against it , " he said in a statement .
mr peres added that he would be asking the international community to declare iran - the alleged supplier of the shipment - a supporter of terrorism .
iran denies that it had any connection with the shipment .
mr zinni is trying to move both sides towards accepting a formal truce , the details of which were outlined last year by the head of the us central intelligence agency , george tenet .
under this plan , israel would withdraw its troops from palestinian areas to positions they held before the outbreak of fighting in september 2000 , and the palestinian security forces would make an all-out effort to prevent attacks on israelis by palestinian militants .
mitchell plan with a truce in place , the two sides would then implement the proposals of an international commission headed by former us senator george mitchell .
israel would freeze all settlement activity in the west bank and gaza , while the palestinians would dismantle militant groups .
israeli prime minister ariel sharon - who also met mr zinni on friday - has said he will only commit himself to the truce deal once there has been a week of complete calm .
there has been a sharp drop in violence since mr arafat renewed his commitment to a ceasefire on 16 december , although there has been sporadic violence .
