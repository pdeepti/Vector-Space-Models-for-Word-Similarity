" we can confirm that we have n't put anybody on a plane today and we have no intention to deport anyone in the next 24 hours home office spokesman the move will be welcomed by opponents of zimbabwean president robert mugabe trying to remain in britain .
it follows increasing international pressure on the british government to change its policy towards zimbabwean asylum seekers , after mr mugabe introduced tough laws to suppress opposition .
activists fear violence and intimidation in the run-up to elections in march .

" we can confirm that we have n't put anybody on a plane today and we have no intention to deport anyone in the next 24 hours , " he said .
mr blunkett revealed the decision at a cross-party meeting with his tory counterpart oliver letwin , who hailed the move as " a victory for common sense " .
the new home office assessment of zimbabwe , which is due by the end of the week , could to be used as a platform for a more permanent review of asylum policy towards the country , in the light of heightened political tensions .
the move comes after prime minister tony blair discussed the troubled situation in zimbabwe with south african president thabo mbeki .
downing street says both mr blair and mr mbeki , who spoke by telephone on saturday , are taking the matter very seriously .
meanwhile , mr mugabe was in malawi on monday to discuss the crisis in zimbabwe with other african leaders at a meeting of the southern african development community .
' extreme caution ' earlier , downing street 's apparent change of heart was welcomed by amnesty international .
" amnesty international has always urged that there is the need for extreme caution in deporting zimbabweans in the present climate , " a spokesman told the bbc .
meanwhile , human rights groups have stepped up calls for a change in the way the uk 's asylum system works .
alasdair mackenzie , of pressure group asylum aid , said the home office did not have " adequate information " on countries to make informed decisions on asylum claims .
calling for an independent documentation centre for asylum claims , he said the home office only updated its assessments every six months and tended to put a positive gloss on events .

professor muhammad anwar , of the university of warwick 's centre for research in ethic relations , said britain 's multi-racial society is scarcely reflected within the political institutions .
it 's alright to appoint an asian as deputy chairman of the conservative party but what does it mean ?
professor anwar he told bbc news online that with only a handful of members from ethnic minorities at the greater london and welsh assemblies , the scottish parliament and at westminster , it was time for action .
" it 's a two-way thing - obviously ethnic minorities have to come forward to participate but they can only participate if the system encourages them .

the result was a large increase in the intake of women mps and , although the system was subsequently shown to be in breach of employment laws in the courts in 1998 , professor anwar believes it could apply to the ethnic minorities .

" it 's like a medical doctor who is a spokesman on health .
it 's like working class mps who were miners , " he said .
as long ago as 1974 professor anwar was involved in a national survey concerned with finding out whether members of the ethnic minorities were registering to vote .
it is an issue that still concerns him today .
in his 1999 research for operation black vote , which aimed to get ethnic groups involved in the process , he demonstrated that while 18 % of white people were not on the electoral register that figure shot to 25 % among ethnic minorities .
professor anwar is now waiting to see whether the new rolling system of registration introduced at the beginning of this year has an impact .
" if you miss the first step then you are not there as far as the parties are concerned - you do n't exist , " he said .

figures highlight an increase of more than 1,000 in the number of attacks causing actual bodily harm last year , compared with the 1999 statistics .
the annual crime report from the garda siochana -lrb- irish police -rrb- for the year 2000 also showed that the number of murders and manslaughters had risen on the previous year 's figure .
and the report indicated that there were six rapes each week and four serious drugs offences for every day of the year . "
there is a need for a greater emphasis on community policing and a more visible garda presence on the streets " alan shatter fine gael however , figures for burglary , armed robbery and theft from cars were down .
garda spokesman superintendent john farrelly said : " the increase in assaults against persons is a worrying trend , even though the detection rate is 82 % . "
the sections of the report indicating a decrease in certain crimes were welcomed by irish justice minister john o 'donoghue .
he said it was further evidence that the commitments made by the irish government in relation to fighting crime were being delivered .
criticism but he added : " i am the first to recognise that greatly improved crime statistics are cold comfort to those who find themselves the victims of crime .
" we can not allow a return to the type of complacency which gave rise to the highest levels ever of serious crime here in 1995 .
" i propose , in particular , to continue to give priority to reducing the level of street crime , which i know can cause so much concern in our communities . "
however , the report was criticised by the largest opposition party , fine gael .
the party 's justice spokesman alan shatter said : " the justice minister has failed abysmally to ensure that streets are safe .
" this report confirms that there has been a disturbing increase in street violence throughout the country .
" there is a need for a greater emphasis on community policing and a more visible garda presence on the streets . "

slimming clubs - led by weight watchers - are signing in more customers than ever before .
weight watchers ' chief first joined classes in london with minds intent on weight loss , few dieters are worried about the other pounds they will be shedding in the form of weekly fees .
and yet as the weight comes off the slimmers , the companies are piling on the profits .
weight watchers is a testimony to the financial success of slimming firms .
it enjoyed one of the most successful flotations of 2001 - while a wide range of other companies suffered a miserable year and the market for new listings all but dried up amid a great deal of stock market gloom .
spreading out " we 've seen five years of very consistent growth worldwide , " linda huett , president and chief executive of weight watchers told bbc news online " i see no reason why we ca n't consistently deliver strong growth .
the sad fact is that as nations we 're just getting heavier and more people are facing a weight problem . "
the company now runs more than 37,000 classes - in countries such as australia , mexico , south africa , latvia , hong kong and the cayman islands - with attendance growing 13 % every year for the last three years .
as far as i 'm concerned , i 've lost weight and maintained it ... to me it was worth every ha 'penny linda nicholson weight watcher in the uk alone , weight watchers holds 6,000 meetings a week , with an average of 40 members - each paying £ 4.50 .
that 's revenues of over £ 1m pounds each week - with relatively few overheads other than the hourly rental of a church hall and the salary of one or two employees , usually part-time and working on commission .
then there 's the profitable business of selling a wide assortment of diet accessories - including healthy snack food , recipe books , cds and calorie counting calculators .
share success given the way that the firm is growing - and some alarming statistics about rising obesity in the western world - it is perhaps no surprise that investors decided the firm was a safe bet .
it 's tapping into people 's vulnerabilities lindsay allen actress with a starting price of $ 24 , the stock rocketed by almost a fifth on its first day of trading and has stayed above $ 30 for the past seven weeks .

perhaps more surprising than the enthusiasm of investors , is the enthusiasm of class attendees despite their knowing the firm is on target to report annual profits of well over $ 200m .
successful weight loss , it seems , overshadows any worries about profiteering .
" yes , it does cost quite a lot , but i do n't mind paying because it was the only thing which made me stick to the diet , " said becky openshaw , a lecturer from rickmansworth .
sarah ferguson is a figurehead for the plan " in some ways it 's paying to extend your life and improve its quality . "
" initially i thought - why should i be paying to lose weight ?
but as the weight came off , i realised the value of the classes , " said linda nicholson , from manchester who has been a member of weight watchers for 18 years and is now a class leader .
" as far as i 'm concerned , i 've lost weight and maintained it .
to me it was worth every ha 'penny . "
she even seemed unconcerned about the $ 417.6m raked in - and not reinvested into the weight watchers business - by the private investment firm artal luxembourg when in floated a 17 % stake last november .
" i say well done to them - they came up trumps , " ms nicholson told bbc news online .
disaster benefits not even the depressing combination of an economic slowdown and the tragic events of 11 september has been able to suppress the growth of the classes .
weight watchers , expanding profits , year ending in april 1999-2000 : $ 198.1m 1998-1999 : $ 185.7m 1997-1998 : $ 137.2m profits for the first nine months of 2001 rose an impressive 63.5 % to $ 160m .
" when there are a lot of things going wrong in your life , taking control of -lsb- your weight -rsb- makes you feel you 're doing something that is good , " explains ms huett .
and even the rise in unemployment has been a boon for the diet business .
" when people are having to go out into a job market , taking control or your weight and feeling better about how you present yourself to strangers is also a positive , " said ms huett .
room for growth of course , some people have more reservations about the money being made by slimming clubs .
percentage of women aged 25-64 , who have attended weight watchers uk : 20 % us : 7 % sweden : 13 % finland : 10 % germany : 2 % " it 's tapping into people 's vulnerabilities , " said lindsay allen , an actress from south london .
while that is indisputably true , so is the fact that more and more people are desperate to lose weight .
and , as ms huett explains , there are plenty new areas for weight watchers to target - more male slimmers , interactive dieting through the internet and new regions of the world .
only 1 % of british woman like the way they look , while 70 % say they are depressed by their appearance , according to a recent survey by newwoman.co.uk.
and health experts warned earlier this year that obesity is rising to epidemic levels and is now affecting more than 300 million people worldwide .
so as people keep on growing , weight watchers is likely to be doing the same .

the underlying rate of inflation rose by 0.1 percentage points in december to an annual rate of 1.9 % , still below the government 's target of 2.5 % - with a leeway of one percentage point in each direction .
higher food prices are thought to have been offset by cheaper petrol prices and lower prices in the high street as retailers battle for custom .
the headline rate of inflation - which includes the cost of home loans - fell by 0.2 percentage points to 0.7 % because of cheaper mortgage costs .
rate cuts the underlying rate of inflation - which strips out mortgage costs - has now remained below the target level for 32 of the past 33 months .
this allowed the bank to make seven rate cuts last year without too much fear of stoking inflation as it tried to prevent the uk economy from falling into recession .
the uk base rate is now at 4.0 % - its lowest level for 37 years .
but there has been speculation that the direction may not be about to change , after strong high street sales in the run-up to christmas raised fears of a consumer boom .
earlier this month the governor of the bank of england sir edward george told the bbc that the bank may have to raise rates if the surge in spending saw no signs of abating .
sir edward on monday toned down his warning , saying in a speech in glasgow that a rate rise was not " imminent " .
last week the british retail consortium said high street prices were remaining stable despite the high levels of consumer demand .
and some economists think that there may be room for one more rate cut in the current cycle , before rates begin to rise again later in the year .

there has been no new outbreak for three months in northumberland - the county where the disease was initially traced - and tests on sheep there have proved negative .
it will still be several weeks before restrictions on livestock farmers can be lifted - and perhaps months before britain can trade fully with the rest of the world .
the national farmers ' union said the lifting of restrictions would remove a " long , dark shadow " from the countryside after 11 months of hell .
foot-and-mouth facts confirmed cases : 2,030 cattle slaughtered : 595,000 sheep slaughtered : 3,306,000 pigs slaughtered : 142,000 other animals slaughtered : 4,000 total animals culled : 4,047,000 countryside agency puts cost to uk farming at up to £ 2.4bn cost to tourism estimated at between £ 2bn and £ 3bn many farmers are critical of the government 's handling of the foot-and-mouth crisis and say far more should have been done to stop the disease spreading .
there were more than 2,000 cases in britain in the 2001 outbreak and more than four million animals have been culled .
the cost to farming - leaving aside any damage to tourism - stands at more than £ 2bn .
a spokesman for the organisation that sets the worldwide guidelines on animal diseases says a final decision on britain 's foot-and-mouth free status could be made as early as next week .
speaking on radio 4 's farming today programme , dr jim pearson from the oie -lrb- office international des epizooties -rrb- says the organisation 's foot-and-mouth commission is meeting next week .
if the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- makes an application in time , this could be considered favourably by the commission .
oie disease-free status would allow britain to export to the rest of the world .
at present , only limited exports are allowed within the eu .
' step forward ' dougie watkins , a sheep and cattle farmer from berwick-upon-tweed in northumberland , said of the all-clear : " everybody will be just issuing a huge sigh of relief . "
mr watkins ' livestock were destroyed last april but he said he was well on his way to rebuilding his business .
but he said the government had many lessons to learn from the outbreak , and added : " the great worry is that the fundamentals of how it started are n't known . "
earlier on monday , rural affairs minister lord whitty told the house of lords of northumberland 's change in status , describing it as " a good news announcement " .
the move was " a major step forward " but was " not the end of the story or the end of the risk of the disease " , he said .
" it will be some time , probably months , before our international partners restore our trading status in the european union and beyond as a fully foot-and-mouth free state , " lord whitty added .
northumberland has been one of the areas worst affected by foot-and-mouth , with a total of 234,117 animals culled in the county since the outbreak began last year .
the county had one of the first confirmed cases at heddon-on-the-wall in february last year .
controversial legislation lord whitty was speaking as the second reading began of the animal health bill , which aims to strengthen protection against future outbreaks of foot-and-mouth and other infectious diseases .
the controversial legislation would give government vets the power to enter a farm and cull all its animals and force farmers to help in the cull , with little right of appeal .
it was branded a " panic measure " and a " bad bill " by the opposition .
meanwhile , it has been claimed that an inquiry into the foot-and-mouth outbreak in northumberland has been weakened by the absence of army and government officials .
northumberland county council is hosting a five-day investigation into the spread of the virus and how rural communities were affected .
the inquiry is being led by professor michael dower , a former director general of the countryside commission and a lecturer in european rural development at the university of gloucestershire .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- farmers hail foot-and-mouth ' victory ' news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : uk news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england n ireland scotland wales politics education business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk tuesday , 15 january , 2002 , 10:08 gmt farmers hail foot-and-mouth ' victory ' the outbreak has cost uk farming more than £ 2bn britain has been officially declared free of foot-and-mouth almost 11 months after the first case of the disease was found , in a decision farmers say gives new hope for their industry 's future .
there has been no new outbreak for three months in northumberland - the county where the disease was initially traced - and tests on sheep there have proved negative .
it will still be several weeks before restrictions on livestock farmers can be lifted - and perhaps months before britain can trade fully with the rest of the world .
the national farmers ' union said the lifting of restrictions would remove a " long , dark shadow " from the countryside after 11 months of hell .
foot-and-mouth facts confirmed cases : 2,030 cattle slaughtered : 595,000 sheep slaughtered : 3,306,000 pigs slaughtered : 142,000 other animals slaughtered : 4,000 total animals culled : 4,047,000 countryside agency puts cost to uk farming at up to £ 2.4bn cost to tourism estimated at between £ 2bn and £ 3bn many farmers are critical of the government 's handling of the foot-and-mouth crisis and say far more should have been done to stop the disease spreading .
there were more than 2,000 cases in britain in the 2001 outbreak and more than four million animals have been culled .
the cost to farming - leaving aside any damage to tourism - stands at more than £ 2bn .
a spokesman for the organisation that sets the worldwide guidelines on animal diseases says a final decision on britain 's foot-and-mouth free status could be made as early as next week .
speaking on radio 4 's farming today programme , dr jim pearson from the oie -lrb- office international des epizooties -rrb- says the organisation 's foot-and-mouth commission is meeting next week .
if the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- makes an application in time , this could be considered favourably by the commission .
oie disease-free status would allow britain to export to the rest of the world .
at present , only limited exports are allowed within the eu .
' step forward ' dougie watkins , a sheep and cattle farmer from berwick-upon-tweed in northumberland , said of the all-clear : " everybody will be just issuing a huge sigh of relief . "
mr watkins ' livestock were destroyed last april but he said he was well on his way to rebuilding his business .
but he said the government had many lessons to learn from the outbreak , and added : " the great worry is that the fundamentals of how it started are n't known . "
earlier on monday , rural affairs minister lord whitty told the house of lords of northumberland 's change in status , describing it as " a good news announcement " .
the move was " a major step forward " but was " not the end of the story or the end of the risk of the disease " , he said .
" it will be some time , probably months , before our international partners restore our trading status in the european union and beyond as a fully foot-and-mouth free state , " lord whitty added .
northumberland has been one of the areas worst affected by foot-and-mouth , with a total of 234,117 animals culled in the county since the outbreak began last year .
the county had one of the first confirmed cases at heddon-on-the-wall in february last year .
controversial legislation lord whitty was speaking as the second reading began of the animal health bill , which aims to strengthen protection against future outbreaks of foot-and-mouth and other infectious diseases .

nhs chief executive nigel crisp said it was not acceptable that some managers had been re-employed elsewhere in the service after resigning because they were under investigation .
he told the commons public accounts committee that he also wants an end to big pay-offs to such individuals and a managerial code of conduct was being introduced .
responding to questions about allegations that waiting lists were manipulated to show better results he also promised greater openness to prevent similar action in the future .
the committee called mr crisp in after a national audit office report alleged that up to 6,000 patients in nine hospitals had been affected by the practice .
whistle-blowing mr crisp said he regarded the waiting list ' fiddles ' extremely seriously and the significance of the action for those patients affected could not be underestimated .
nigel crisp was ' shocked ' by the findings promising clearer guidelines he said : " we 're introducing a management code of conduct so that if somebody is adjudged to have broken the management code of conduct in one setting as a manager in the nhs , they should not be employed as a manager anywhere else in the nhs . "
but mr crisp said the key to patient satisfaction would come from better whistle-blowing systems inside the nhs , an independent inspection system and the publication of waiting list information on the internet .
" i think giving patients information is probably the single biggest safeguard we can bring in , " he said .
' shocking ' it 's the lowest form of cynicism for managers to protect their own backs and their own jobs at the risk of extending and aggravating the suffering of patients waiting for treatment alan williams mr crisp told mps he found the report 's findings shocking and that very serious issues had been raised , damaging the reputation of honest , hardworking nhs managers .
he said very important lessons had been learned from the nao report and patients should be able to expect better from nhs management .
mp 's on the committee expressed anger at cases of nhs managers who were found manipulating waiting list figures and then allowed to resign with compensation packages .
alan williams , labour mp for swansea west , said : " it 's the lowest form of cynicism for managers to protect their own backs and their own jobs at the risk of extending and aggravating the suffering of patients waiting for treatment . "
pressure pressure is no excuse for doing these sorts of things nigel crisp mr crisp denied claims , backed by conservative leader iain duncan smith , that the problems were caused because waiting list targets put too much pressure on managers .
he said : " there is no evidence that it was pressure .
if it was , everybody would be doing it .
" pressure is no excuse for doing these sorts of things . "
mr crisp said he did not believe any of the 6,000 patients affected had died as a result , although he was asking the trusts involved to establish whether any had suffered .
whether compensation should be paid to any of them was a matter for the trusts , he said .
' organisational failure ' the national audit office report said waiting lists were manipulated , on purpose or as a result of " organisational failure " , so patients did not exceed the government 's 18 month limit .
at the surrey and sussex healthcare trust it is claimed patients were asked when they would be on holiday and then deliberately offered appointments at those times .
elsewhere it is alleged patient records were systematically amended and patients removed from waiting lists .

the new year brings a host of new singles , including a re-release of george harrison 's my sweet lord .
also released on monday are the chemical brothers ' star guitar , new band black rebel motorcycle club 's love burns , pop diva pink 's latest , get the party started and fat boy slim 's retox .
the bbc 's nigel packer said of my sweet lord : " few songs capture the spirit of george 's solo work as well as this gentle anthem from 1971 . "
but what do you think ?
is it a timeless track ?
what about the rest of this week 's competition ?
have your say my sweet lord is a timeless classic from an album full of brilliant songs made by an excellent musician but most of all an outstanding human being .
terry harbron , england songs like my sweet lord will never cease to sound fresh .
i still have my original vinyl copy on the apple label , with a great b side what is life .
i ¿ m looking forward to it being back in the charts .
tim , uk yes , one of the most inspirational songs of all time .
huck jordan , us virgin islands my sweet lord is an uplifting , beautiful track .
all those acoustic guitars and masses of voices .
gorgeous .
it would have made a wonderful christmas release .
god bless you george !
pete tucker , uk my sweet lord is an example of what a simple well-structured song may achieve raul arreola chapa , mexico as timeless as its subject .
r richards , usa serene and soothing .
peter foster , usa my sweet lord is an example of what a simple well-structured song may achieve .
its sensitive harmonics make you want to grab an acoustic guitar on the spot .
however , i 'm not sure whether g.h. enjoyed the success of this song due to the long legal battle that the song provoked .
raul arreola chapa , mexico my sweet lord is indeed a timeless classic !
the song really was a statement of who george was and what he believed in .
of all the meaningless songs out these days , it is great to have such a powerful song back on the air .
tony s. , usa proved in court to be a blatant riff off from the chiffons " he 's so fine " .
therefore does n't exactly show much originality does it ?
andy shanks , uk i think george harrisons single will get to number one easy , i think it is a great record , i was 13 when it first came out .
i will be buying it .
graham powell , uk although i am 24 i had never heard the song until after georges ' death .
from the first time i heard it i absolutely fell in love with the song .
i would say that on this point alone it must be considered timeless .
i do n't usually buy singles but i shall definitely be buying this one !
adrian manic , uk what a fitting tribute it would be if the song got to number one in the charts chris o 'donoghue , uk ca n't we forget about the beatles now ?
look at the fuss the bbc made of acid house .
well , what were half of the beatles records about ?
the world has grown up since the 60s .
no-one -lrb- who 's worth listening to -rrb- cares about what paul mccartney or yoko ono have to say .
why do n't they just do like ringo and fade away with some respect intact ?
j roberts , england i think my sweet lord is a wonderful song , which i was too young to buy when it came out , so i 'm seizing the opportunity now .
it 's also a great way to celebrate george 's genius , which was n't always recognised when he was alive .
what 's more , i believe , although it 's not often been stated in the news lately , that although george lost the lawsuit over plagiarising my sweet lord from the chiffons ' he 's so fine , he subsequently bought the rights to he 's so fine , so that he owned both songs free and clear .
his way of making things all right with the karma police ?
lucy , london , england i find the song very objectional because it is worship of someone other than god .
hari krishner is not god .
if the bbc played a hymn of worship to the lord god on the radio / tv as part of entertainment they would get loads of comments and objections .
brian reid , uk is it really 31 years since we first heard george harrison 's timeless classic ?
what a fitting tribute it would be if the song got to number one in the charts .
how sad it is that we never recognise how great people are until they die .
the other new releases can not compete but maybe it is unfair to even ask them to .
chris o 'donoghue , uk it was beautiful on its original release and still sounds amazing today felix , uk i still think that it sounds like " he 's so fine " ! ! !
john mills , uk another cash-in .
every time someone dies , their greatest number one is re-released -lrb- unless you are royalty , in which case elton john 's greatest number one gets re-released . -rrb-
the british public love to openly mourn strangers ' deaths , and this gives a cynical pop industry fuel enough to milk them .
krelling , uk this is timeless alright , because of the power of the message .
it is a call from the heart to lord krishna .
george harrison 's passing is very sad but his relationship with krishna is here for us all to witness again with the re-release of my sweet lord .
andy jordan , england as for competition to the re-release of my sweet lord ...
the chemical brothers are pretty good and my old mate quentin -lrb- aka norman -rrb- cook is n't short on talent .
however , just when we all thought that the mid eighties was the worst period for music since the second ice age , the early 2000s happened .
my sweet lord is one of the all time greats - no contest .
frank , uk my sweet lord is a beautiful track .
it was beautiful on its original release and still sounds amazing today .
truly timeless .
felix , uk it is very sad that he is remembered by a song he " borrowed " from the chiffons and not one he wrote himself -lrb- like " got my mind set on you " -rrb- .
al , uk harrison 's track holds fond memories for me .
i welcome its re-release .
the rest will be the usual dross bar , perhaps , fbs 's single .
pepe , uk surely a more suitable tribute release would have been the title track from his first solo album all things must pass mick ferris , uk george was great while in the beatles , but afterwards it was all downhill .
my sweet lord has the same bit for the chorus as the verse , and sounds very repetitive .
i remember reading somewhere that the melody of harrison 's my sweet lord was taken from the song of another writer , and harrison had to pay compensation from his royalties .
this song exemplifies how harrison was out of touch with his audience .
during his disastrous us tour of the early 1970s , he would ask the audience to chant hare krishna for several minutes at a time .
great entertainment .
andrew strong , uk is my sweet lord a timeless track ?
yes .
should it be re-released ?
no .
why ?
if emi is so concerned about donating the proceeds to charity , why not donate the 2002 proceeds from all things must pass ?
emi is clearly hoping to capitalise on the success of the single to boost sales of harrison 's emi-apple output .
corporate altruism not only does n't exist ; it 's a contradiction in terms .
even in death harrison is living in the material world .
is n't it a pity !
cyril , canada i think the song my sweet lord is a fantastic track , that really should have been released in time for christmas .
it evokes loving , friendly , neighbourly thoughts , that many songs that are around now do not , but actually cause frustration and anger instead .
i will be buying one when it is out .
sam bird , uk considering the lost plagiarism case with the publishers of the chiffons ' 1964 hit she 's so fine -lrb- which has an almost identical melody to my sweet lord -rrb- , surely a more suitable tribute release would have been the title track from his first solo album all things must pass , a beautiful , and far more original song than my sweet lord .
mick ferris , uk i guess the bbc will give this hari krishna record plenty of airplay whilst continuing to ignore really good christian contemporary music keith waters , uk my sweet lord is a beautiful song with a simple but important message .
the most impressive thing about the song is the sincerity .
few artists have the skill to write this sort of song well .
a classic !
richard mands , uk nothing wrong with my sweet lord but he did produce other material over the years and it would have been nice for something less stereotypical to have been chosen .
for example , his album cloud nine , produced by jeff lynn in 1987 , had a fine track called just for today .
and does n't a large proportion of the royalties from my sweet lord go to the writers of he 's so fine ?
alastair , uk george harrison 's my sweet lord is needed now more than ever .
let 's pray for each other and world peace !
patricia humphrey , usa my sweet lord is one of the greatest songs ever written .
it is great news that it is going to be re-released and should make a significant contribution to the material world foundation and a wonderul tribute to the memory of george harrison .
zoe , uk i guess the bbc will give this hari krishna record plenty of airplay whilst continuing to ignore really good christian contemporary music such as delirious ?
it is not that i have any thing against it musically , it 's just that the bbc seems frightened to acknowledge that equally valid music exists from a christian faith view .
sad but true , the bbc is biased .
keith waters , uk this song begins interesting and thereafter disappoints , right to the end .
it is repetitive , monotonous and unimaginative , just like humming a mantra over and over .
the relics are not intelligent , nor thought-provoking , nor significant .
this is a complete con and anyone buying the cd and listening to it deserves to lose their money and their time respectively .
mervyn hing , uk my sweet lord is a mediocre track , bland and boring trevor james , uk here goes the music industry again , anything goes in the pursuit of money .
odds-on number one record from someone who recently dies and the " charity " record comes out .
some money will go to charity , but a big chunk goes in the slimy pockets of the music mogels .
sick , sick , sick .
neil , uk the pathetic response of record companies , jumping onto any occasion where they can imagine a mid-term profit , shows how mean and ridiculous the music business is .
despite granting the earnings of this single to charity , they 'll be making loads of money by " reminding " people that george harrison has other recordings .
obviously , the record company wo n't donate any of the profits on other recordings ...
xavier sanchez , spain i think it 's a great idea , and i shall personally buy it , having bought the first record .
to give the proceeds to charity is good thing .
jennifer roberts , uk " my sweet lord " is a mediocre track , bland and boring .
it has only succeeded in the charts this time round due to the massive radio play it has received .
i do n't know the official figures , but i 'm sure it 's one of the most played songs at the moment on virgin radio .
surely he wrote something better ?
trevor james , uk great idea .
it will give us a chance to remember and appreciate george harrison .
nadeem fayyaz , usa considering this single caused george so many troubles in copyright suits i thought it would be better to take another song of his eddie , switzerland as someone who received sergeant pepper as a 21st birthday present - it was first released just before my birthday - i have been a lifelong follower of the beatles and their component parts .
george 's my sweet lord is a favourite and i am very happy to see it re-released .
i just hope that those who buy it will listen to its sentiments , and think about their own spirituality , and the fact that we are not alone in this world .
the words , however , can be misleading .
it does n't take so long to see or to find our lord .
the evidence is all around us .
it is up to us humans to make the most of that evidence - something we seem singularly unable to do for any length of time .
perhaps , however , george knew better - he was always the deeepest and most thinking of the four .
graham follett , uk ever since i was a child i have been told that the beatles were the best thing since sliced bread , something that has coloured my view of them .
this song , however , is beautiful .
having heard it a couple of times since george harrison died , it is constantly popping up in my mind .
a credit to its lasting quality .
andreas white , united kingdom my sweet lord is nothing but nauseating , twee , self-congratulatory rubbish to appeal to the self-righteous .
luckily i was n't born the last time around .
iain nicholson , uk a great record , but i wonder whether my sweet lord is the best choice for a charity record - much of the royalties will surely go to the authors of the chiffons hit " he 's so fine " which harrison plagiarised -lrb- albeit unconsciously -rrb- for my sweet lord .
gareth parry , uk my sweet lord is a song with real meaning and a timeless message , unlike much of the trash that is released nowadays .
if more " artists " had the same kind of god consciousness that george harrison had , and if more of the music we hear on a daily basis carried this same feeling of love for god , then the world would be a much better place .
my sweet lord should be played as much as possible this week , and all the weeks to come .
richard , uk would prefer a remake of his song that he wrote for patti boyd iris sharland , england considering this single caused george so many troubles in copyright suits i thought it would be better to take another song of his .
was n't " while my guitar gently weeps " one of his few songs ?
maybe not as popular like " got my mind set on you " or " my sweet lord " but at least is less controversial .
personally i suggest a re-release of " life of brian " ; after all rumour has it that it was only with george 's money that the film got produced in the first place .
eddie , switzerland is this song really relevant when the chart audience is so young ?
but it will get to no.1 of course .
jamie , uk it 's number one in my heart .
i wore my original vinyl out .
looking forward to hearing my sweet lord all over the air waves .
wish there were more music heros like george .
bob d. , usa my radio playing " my sweet lord " on my way home , after my happy weekend kayak fishing in malibu , california .
these few minutes are the happiest time of my life , i wish the station could repeat them several times . "
my sweet lord " - dear george , you are the greatest .
you enrich our life and make our life so enjoyable .
i am 54 , so you know it 's timeless !
robert sheu , california , usa it will be a wonderful tribute to a great musician and artist who is sadly missed to have it re-released .
gill goodsell , england utterly tedious .
andrew collyer , uk i do n't think that this is the best choice of song .
to me it sounds somewhat dated and rather miserable .
one of his more recent hits like " got my mind set on you " would have been much better .
it 's a more lifting song and dare i say , not a blatant rip-off of an old hit .
jason jones , england , uk andy shanks is wrong .
" my sweet lord " was proven in court to be a subconscious copy of the chiffons song .
admittedly he ended up paying up over the lawsuit , but do you think george would have done something as stupid as to deliberately copy the riff from " he 's so fine " when millions of people would have spotted this ?
paul , england would prefer a remake of his song that he wrote for patti boyd - lovely - but ca n't remember title .
iris sharland , england i was especially taken by pink 's number - a high-energy-take- no-prisoners-in-your-face jam !
robert del valle , usa shiny , insubstantial ear-candy .
morbid , uk i believe my sweet lord deserves to be number one for this week .
the single is the best thing i 've heard on the radio for a long time and puts a lot of so called modern music to shame .
it would have been somewhat crass to put the single out for christmas and now as it is the new year and the fact that the proceeds will go to a good cause reinforces its appeal and now it can be number one for all the right reasons .
well done to all concerned .
alex , uk george harrison wrote and performed some beautiful songs , but this is n't one of them .
my sweet lord is a repetitive dirge , and it was proved in court that he plagiarised the writers of a near identical tune .
why not " something " or one of his truly great hits instead of this popularist rubbish ?
tony clare , uk one of the most beautiful rip offs of our time .
reckon noel gallagher would be jealous of that one .
george is missed .
james bate , uk i have never bought an album or a single , which is not in hindi -lrb- bollywood -rrb- .
but the release of my sweet lord will change it ..
raju khagram , united kingdom i have always had mixed feelings about my sweet lord because of the embarassing lawsuit brought against it by the chiffons .
while mu guitar gently weeps is the definitive harrison work .
the other songs are great , but i was especially taken by pink 's number - a high-energy-take- no-prisoners-in-your-face jam !
robert del valle , usa of course that george 's song my sweet lord it ´ s a timeless track ! ! , i think the songs in the competition wo n't last much time like george 's .
my sweet lord has lasted more than 30 years and i 'm very sure will last another 30 and much more , and after that nobody will remember the songs , even the groups or singers in this week 's competition .
alberto nájera-garcía , puebla , pue .
méxico almost anything by george harrison is timeless and beautiful .
my sweet lord is expecially moving and is as relevant and great today as it was in ' 71 .
christina salomon , usa " few songs capture the spirit of george 's solo work " - funny , i thought he was found guilty of plagiarising this song from the chiffons ? !
hardly a solo effort .
andy , uk although i am big fan of george harrison and the beatles , am i the only person who thinks this song is not very good .
it is repetitive and lyrically poor .
he wrote lots of better songs that could have been released instead .
conal , england when paul mc cartney was singing silly love songs and john lennon was trying to give peace a chance , dear old george was singing to the lord with what must be the best song of that decade and runner up to yesterday the best song ever .
peter walker , berks long live george , great solo song from 1971 and his best solo lp .
sad to say he probably did lose it a little after all things must pass , but here was an ex-beatle at his peak. john king , uk it 's one of the songs that proves harrison was as good a songwriter , if not better than either mccartney or lennon .
and i doubt we 'll hear a slide guitar line as haunting as that again .
stuart , uk it 's okay , but nothing special .
i do n't remember anyone waxing lyrical before he died ian matthews , uk i think it is disgusting that someone has to die before they are appreciated , but apart fom that it is a good idea .
sandra harrigan , england good to see the record industry always ready to leap on a tragic death and make a bit of money .
robin , uk sorry , i hated this track first time around .
i do n't suppose it will be any different this time .
dougie lawson , uk as with other former beatles ' production , this song is good but does not reach the heights of george 's earlier work .
i would not go as far as labelling it a " timeless " tune , but it is undoubtedly better than 90 % of new songs -lrb- and its dreadful 2000 remake -rrb- .
andrea costa , italy my sweet lord is not one of the " golden oldies " that one hears so often on the radio .
only after the older generation have pushed it into the charts will the younger generation have the chance to hear it regularly and then also buy it .
alastair hood , germany it 's a good song but he wrote much better ones .
i think " here comes the sun " is far better but if it makes loads of money for charity -what the hell .
anna , uk i have great admiration for george - being a beatles fan but i would be suprised if this single tops the chart given the dross our teenagers are prepared to listen to these days .
it appears that who is singing is more important than what is being sung !
also , is n't there a cloud over this particular track re it was or may not have been written by george harrison ?
islwyn , wales the re-release of george harrison 's my sweet lord is a suitable memorial to this greatly missed man .
in death his talent has finally been regcognised .
i do so hope something and here comes the sun will also be re-released .
god bless and thank you george .
david arlow , uk it 's okay , but nothing special .
i do n't remember anyone waxing lyrical before he died .
this has more to do with george harrison 's death than anything else .
ian matthews , uk a timeless classic !
lesley harold , england the market for cds stretches right through the age ranges these days , many tracks get to no. 1 because middle-aged people buy them , the charts are now not solely about young people .
i know there are people who will complain that this is a non-christian song , but when i used to hear it as a child i always assumed it was a christian song anyway and i am sure many people will this time round , so there will be spin-off for all monotheistic religions .
maybe it should be classified simply as a ' spiritual ' song with the listener putting their own interpretation on who it refers to .
keir , uk glad to hear that this song is going to be re-released , i heard it being played on the radio on the sunday morning after george harrison 's death and forgot how happy and uplifting this song is , to me its real ' feel good ' music. stephen lindsay , belfast-n.ireland i must admit the " my sweet lord / i wish i was a pirate " was a much better version !
lee carter , uk ' something ' would have been a better choice or ' what is life ? '
my sweet lord is awful and should be consigned into the bin along with lennon 's ' imagine ' .
sassy , england a beautiful song that reminds us that god is the only important thing in life .
a message of love in a fighting world .
our sweet lord bless you george .
cecilia and cristina , argentina nice song - but uncomfortable with the religious bit .
he found the religion he was happy with and then started preaching .
luigi , uk it was a dreary dirge thirty years ago richard stansfield , uk those who suggest that " my sweet lord " is an inappropriate choice for a charity single because of the plagiarism suit are wrong .
after losing the case george bought the rights to " he 's so fine " outright , so no payments to any other songwriters will have to be made from the single 's proceeds -lrb- also , george did n't write " got my mind set on you " it 's a cover ! ! -rrb- .
yes , record companies are cynical , but so what ?
this re-release is still a fine tribute to george whatever the motives of the men in suits & hard up children around the world will benefit .
i bought it today , i hope it gets to number 1 , i 'm enjoying hearing it on the radio & only wish george was still here to bless us with more great guitar in the future .
rest in peace dear friend , we miss you ...
paul kindred , uk dear mr slim , why do you bother tormenting us by ' doing a michael jackson ' and releasing the umpteenth single of your bad third album ?
why ca n't you take your wife and your money and retire gracefully ?
mike , uk nothing more than a bland advertisment for the hare krishna movement .
unoriginal melody and repetitive lyrics .
i personally rate it as one of the most pathetic of harrisons solo efforts .
methinks it only got to number 1 as it was riding off the success of the beatles .
why not try looking at " when we was fab " or " something " or even " norwegian wood " for some classic songwriting / dry humour !
sadly this effort will probably get to number 1 .
sorry george it 's nothing personal , but if thats considered your best solo effort , lennon & mccartney really did n't have much to worry about !
paul turner , scotland is n't it strange how some people can become unreasonably feted in death ?
my sweet lord is a dreadful song - it 's the sort of thing i used to write aged 14 and would be too embarrassed to play to my friends .
it 's almost one held chord with a pathetic , uninspired melody over it .
and if you had put it on a pub jukebox two months ago , people would have demanded it be turned off .
just because he is no longer with us , we do n't have to lose our heads .
we all know who the talent was in the beatles , and he too is sadly dead .
the other three were largely passengers .
and let 's not forget harrison is the man who also gave us got my mind set on you .
enough said .
alex large , britain yes it is a great song , but it is not his best solo work even if it is his most marketable .
buy the reissue of his album " all things must pass " instead .
edward haworth , uk one of the great number ones , a truly universal song .
it owes more to oh happy day than he 's so fine - it 's a gospel song .
it would be wonderful to see it at number one again .
gordon hastie , scotland why bother re-releasing ?
it 's available in any record store to anyone who really has the need to buy it .
frankly " my sweet lord " is an old , tired song whose only value is nostalgia .
let it go .
linda , canada it was a dreary dirge thirty years ago .
time has not improved it .
richard stansfield , uk why is it that when george harrison sings about his lord , it is considered hip - but when cliff richard sings about jesus people snort and scoff ?
kira , usa my sweet lord is a timeless number one song .
george 's new version on the all things must pass cd is too .
every time that song ends , time stands still .
george knew how to make your heart dance .
hari krishna my sweet george , sherry pietras , usa people have often viewed ' my sweet lord ' as being plagiarised from the chiffons hit ' he 's so fine ' .
not many people remember that george could easily have sued the jam for their number 1 song ' start ' , which was a blatant rip-off of his song ' taxman ' .
jeremy , usa -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- my sweet lord is one of the greatest songs written in history .
it demonstrates what good music can do and what effect it has on us .
pierre , monaco brilliant .
george was just that .
a driving and extremely innovative force behind the beatles .
" my sweet lord " is just a beautiful piece .
while most others will fade away , george and the beatles will withstand the test of time .
ted , usa i am continually disappointed by human nature .
my sweet lord is a track that touches my heart and draws my ear constantly , but why does it take george 's death to provoke this re-release , and the giving of the proceeds to charity ?
this seems to me to be a cynical exercise in public relations , riding the handy passing wave of all the publicity surround george 's tragic departure .
i ca n't quite put my finger on it , but something about this situation simply does n't gel .
great song though , george .
miss you terribly .
warren loveridge , new zealand why is it that when george harrison sings about his lord , it is considered hip - but when cliff richard sings about his lord -lrb- jesus -rrb- people snort and scoff , ridicule him , and say it 's boring old drivel ?
not trying to pour cold water on george 's memory , but cliff has done more to promote his god and his country than ol ' george ever did .

the new year brings a host of new singles , including a re-release of george harrison 's my sweet lord .
also released on monday are the chemical brothers ' star guitar , new band black rebel motorcycle club 's love burns , pop diva pink 's latest , get the party started and fat boy slim 's retox .
the bbc 's nigel packer said of my sweet lord : " few songs capture the spirit of george 's solo work as well as this gentle anthem from 1971 . "
but what do you think ?
is it a timeless track ?
what about the rest of this week 's competition ?
my sweet lord is a timeless classic from an album full of brilliant songs made by an excellent musician but most of all an outstanding human being .
terry harbron , england songs like my sweet lord will never cease to sound fresh .
i still have my original vinyl copy on the apple label , with a great b side what is life .
i ¿ m looking forward to it being back in the charts .
tim , uk yes , one of the most inspirational songs of all time .
huck jordan , us virgin islands my sweet lord is an uplifting , beautiful track .
all those acoustic guitars and masses of voices .
gorgeous .
it would have made a wonderful christmas release .
god bless you george !
pete tucker , uk my sweet lord is an example of what a simple well-structured song may achieve raul arreola chapa , mexico as timeless as its subject .
r richards , usa serene and soothing .
peter foster , usa my sweet lord is an example of what a simple well-structured song may achieve .
its sensitive harmonics make you want to grab an acoustic guitar on the spot .
however , i 'm not sure whether g.h. enjoyed the success of this song due to the long legal battle that the song provoked .
raul arreola chapa , mexico my sweet lord is indeed a timeless classic !
the song really was a statement of who george was and what he believed in .
of all the meaningless songs out these days , it is great to have such a powerful song back on the air .
tony s. , usa proved in court to be a blatant riff off from the chiffons " he 's so fine " .
therefore does n't exactly show much originality does it ?
andy shanks , uk i think george harrisons single will get to number one easy , i think it is a great record , i was 13 when it first came out .
i will be buying it .
graham powell , uk although i am 24 i had never heard the song until after georges ' death .
from the first time i heard it i absolutely fell in love with the song .
i would say that on this point alone it must be considered timeless .
i do n't usually buy singles but i shall definitely be buying this one !
adrian manic , uk what a fitting tribute it would be if the song got to number one in the charts chris o 'donoghue , uk ca n't we forget about the beatles now ?
look at the fuss the bbc made of acid house .
well , what were half of the beatles records about ?
the world has grown up since the 60s .
no-one -lrb- who 's worth listening to -rrb- cares about what paul mccartney or yoko ono have to say .
why do n't they just do like ringo and fade away with some respect intact ?
j roberts , england i think my sweet lord is a wonderful song , which i was too young to buy when it came out , so i 'm seizing the opportunity now .
it 's also a great way to celebrate george 's genius , which was n't always recognised when he was alive .
what 's more , i believe , although it 's not often been stated in the news lately , that although george lost the lawsuit over plagiarising my sweet lord from the chiffons ' he 's so fine , he subsequently bought the rights to he 's so fine , so that he owned both songs free and clear .
his way of making things all right with the karma police ?
lucy , london , england i find the song very objectional because it is worship of someone other than god .
hari krishner is not god .
if the bbc played a hymn of worship to the lord god on the radio / tv as part of entertainment they would get loads of comments and objections .
brian reid , uk is it really 31 years since we first heard george harrison 's timeless classic ?
what a fitting tribute it would be if the song got to number one in the charts .
how sad it is that we never recognise how great people are until they die .
the other new releases can not compete but maybe it is unfair to even ask them to .
chris o 'donoghue , uk it was beautiful on its original release and still sounds amazing today felix , uk i still think that it sounds like " he 's so fine " ! ! !
john mills , uk another cash-in .
every time someone dies , their greatest number one is re-released -lrb- unless you are royalty , in which case elton john 's greatest number one gets re-released . -rrb-
the british public love to openly mourn strangers ' deaths , and this gives a cynical pop industry fuel enough to milk them .
krelling , uk this is timeless alright , because of the power of the message .
it is a call from the heart to lord krishna .
george harrison 's passing is very sad but his relationship with krishna is here for us all to witness again with the re-release of my sweet lord .
andy jordan , england as for competition to the re-release of my sweet lord ...
the chemical brothers are pretty good and my old mate quentin -lrb- aka norman -rrb- cook is n't short on talent .
however , just when we all thought that the mid eighties was the worst period for music since the second ice age , the early 2000s happened .
my sweet lord is one of the all time greats - no contest .
frank , uk my sweet lord is a beautiful track .
it was beautiful on its original release and still sounds amazing today .
truly timeless .
felix , uk it is very sad that he is remembered by a song he " borrowed " from the chiffons and not one he wrote himself -lrb- like " got my mind set on you " -rrb- .
al , uk harrison 's track holds fond memories for me .
i welcome its re-release .
the rest will be the usual dross bar , perhaps , fbs 's single .
pepe , uk surely a more suitable tribute release would have been the title track from his first solo album all things must pass mick ferris , uk george was great while in the beatles , but afterwards it was all downhill .
my sweet lord has the same bit for the chorus as the verse , and sounds very repetitive .
i remember reading somewhere that the melody of harrison 's my sweet lord was taken from the song of another writer , and harrison had to pay compensation from his royalties .
this song exemplifies how harrison was out of touch with his audience .
during his disastrous us tour of the early 1970s , he would ask the audience to chant hare krishna for several minutes at a time .
great entertainment .
andrew strong , uk is my sweet lord a timeless track ?
yes .
should it be re-released ?
no .
why ?
if emi is so concerned about donating the proceeds to charity , why not donate the 2002 proceeds from all things must pass ?
emi is clearly hoping to capitalise on the success of the single to boost sales of harrison 's emi-apple output .
corporate altruism not only does n't exist ; it 's a contradiction in terms .
even in death harrison is living in the material world .
is n't it a pity !
cyril , canada i think the song my sweet lord is a fantastic track , that really should have been released in time for christmas .
it evokes loving , friendly , neighbourly thoughts , that many songs that are around now do not , but actually cause frustration and anger instead .
i will be buying one when it is out .
sam bird , uk considering the lost plagiarism case with the publishers of the chiffons ' 1964 hit she 's so fine -lrb- which has an almost identical melody to my sweet lord -rrb- , surely a more suitable tribute release would have been the title track from his first solo album all things must pass , a beautiful , and far more original song than my sweet lord .
mick ferris , uk i guess the bbc will give this hari krishna record plenty of airplay whilst continuing to ignore really good christian contemporary music keith waters , uk my sweet lord is a beautiful song with a simple but important message .
the most impressive thing about the song is the sincerity .
few artists have the skill to write this sort of song well .
a classic !
richard mands , uk nothing wrong with my sweet lord but he did produce other material over the years and it would have been nice for something less stereotypical to have been chosen .
for example , his album cloud nine , produced by jeff lynn in 1987 , had a fine track called just for today .
and does n't a large proportion of the royalties from my sweet lord go to the writers of he 's so fine ?
alastair , uk george harrison 's my sweet lord is needed now more than ever .
let 's pray for each other and world peace !
patricia humphrey , usa my sweet lord is one of the greatest songs ever written .
it is great news that it is going to be re-released and should make a significant contribution to the material world foundation and a wonderul tribute to the memory of george harrison .
zoe , uk i guess the bbc will give this hari krishna record plenty of airplay whilst continuing to ignore really good christian contemporary music such as delirious ?
it is not that i have any thing against it musically , it 's just that the bbc seems frightened to acknowledge that equally valid music exists from a christian faith view .
sad but true , the bbc is biased .
keith waters , uk this song begins interesting and thereafter disappoints , right to the end .
it is repetitive , monotonous and unimaginative , just like humming a mantra over and over .
the relics are not intelligent , nor thought-provoking , nor significant .
this is a complete con and anyone buying the cd and listening to it deserves to lose their money and their time respectively .
mervyn hing , uk my sweet lord is a mediocre track , bland and boring trevor james , uk here goes the music industry again , anything goes in the pursuit of money .
odds-on number one record from someone who recently dies and the " charity " record comes out .
some money will go to charity , but a big chunk goes in the slimy pockets of the music mogels .
sick , sick , sick .
neil , uk the pathetic response of record companies , jumping onto any occasion where they can imagine a mid-term profit , shows how mean and ridiculous the music business is .
despite granting the earnings of this single to charity , they 'll be making loads of money by " reminding " people that george harrison has other recordings .
obviously , the record company wo n't donate any of the profits on other recordings ...
xavier sanchez , spain i think it 's a great idea , and i shall personally buy it , having bought the first record .
to give the proceeds to charity is good thing .
jennifer roberts , uk " my sweet lord " is a mediocre track , bland and boring .
it has only succeeded in the charts this time round due to the massive radio play it has received .
i do n't know the official figures , but i 'm sure it 's one of the most played songs at the moment on virgin radio .
surely he wrote something better ?
trevor james , uk great idea .
it will give us a chance to remember and appreciate george harrison .
nadeem fayyaz , usa considering this single caused george so many troubles in copyright suits i thought it would be better to take another song of his eddie , switzerland as someone who received sergeant pepper as a 21st birthday present - it was first released just before my birthday - i have been a lifelong follower of the beatles and their component parts .
george 's my sweet lord is a favourite and i am very happy to see it re-released .
i just hope that those who buy it will listen to its sentiments , and think about their own spirituality , and the fact that we are not alone in this world .
the words , however , can be misleading .
it does n't take so long to see or to find our lord .
the evidence is all around us .
it is up to us humans to make the most of that evidence - something we seem singularly unable to do for any length of time .
perhaps , however , george knew better - he was always the deeepest and most thinking of the four .
graham follett , uk ever since i was a child i have been told that the beatles were the best thing since sliced bread , something that has coloured my view of them .
this song , however , is beautiful .
having heard it a couple of times since george harrison died , it is constantly popping up in my mind .
a credit to its lasting quality .
andreas white , united kingdom my sweet lord is nothing but nauseating , twee , self-congratulatory rubbish to appeal to the self-righteous .
luckily i was n't born the last time around .
iain nicholson , uk a great record , but i wonder whether my sweet lord is the best choice for a charity record - much of the royalties will surely go to the authors of the chiffons hit " he 's so fine " which harrison plagiarised -lrb- albeit unconsciously -rrb- for my sweet lord .
gareth parry , uk my sweet lord is a song with real meaning and a timeless message , unlike much of the trash that is released nowadays .
if more " artists " had the same kind of god consciousness that george harrison had , and if more of the music we hear on a daily basis carried this same feeling of love for god , then the world would be a much better place .
my sweet lord should be played as much as possible this week , and all the weeks to come .
richard , uk would prefer a remake of his song that he wrote for patti boyd iris sharland , england considering this single caused george so many troubles in copyright suits i thought it would be better to take another song of his .
was n't " while my guitar gently weeps " one of his few songs ?
maybe not as popular like " got my mind set on you " or " my sweet lord " but at least is less controversial .
personally i suggest a re-release of " life of brian " ; after all rumour has it that it was only with george 's money that the film got produced in the first place .
eddie , switzerland is this song really relevant when the chart audience is so young ?
but it will get to no.1 of course .
jamie , uk it 's number one in my heart .
i wore my original vinyl out .
looking forward to hearing my sweet lord all over the air waves .
wish there were more music heros like george .
bob d. , usa my radio playing " my sweet lord " on my way home , after my happy weekend kayak fishing in malibu , california .
these few minutes are the happiest time of my life , i wish the station could repeat them several times . "
my sweet lord " - dear george , you are the greatest .
you enrich our life and make our life so enjoyable .
i am 54 , so you know it 's timeless !
robert sheu , california , usa it will be a wonderful tribute to a great musician and artist who is sadly missed to have it re-released .
gill goodsell , england utterly tedious .
andrew collyer , uk i do n't think that this is the best choice of song .
to me it sounds somewhat dated and rather miserable .
one of his more recent hits like " got my mind set on you " would have been much better .
it 's a more lifting song and dare i say , not a blatant rip-off of an old hit .
jason jones , england , uk andy shanks is wrong .
" my sweet lord " was proven in court to be a subconscious copy of the chiffons song .
admittedly he ended up paying up over the lawsuit , but do you think george would have done something as stupid as to deliberately copy the riff from " he 's so fine " when millions of people would have spotted this ?
paul , england would prefer a remake of his song that he wrote for patti boyd - lovely - but ca n't remember title .
iris sharland , england i was especially taken by pink 's number - a high-energy-take- no-prisoners-in-your-face jam !
robert del valle , usa shiny , insubstantial ear-candy .
morbid , uk i believe my sweet lord deserves to be number one for this week .
the single is the best thing i 've heard on the radio for a long time and puts a lot of so called modern music to shame .
it would have been somewhat crass to put the single out for christmas and now as it is the new year and the fact that the proceeds will go to a good cause reinforces its appeal and now it can be number one for all the right reasons .
well done to all concerned .
alex , uk george harrison wrote and performed some beautiful songs , but this is n't one of them .
my sweet lord is a repetitive dirge , and it was proved in court that he plagiarised the writers of a near identical tune .
why not " something " or one of his truly great hits instead of this popularist rubbish ?
tony clare , uk one of the most beautiful rip offs of our time .
reckon noel gallagher would be jealous of that one .
george is missed .
james bate , uk i have never bought an album or a single , which is not in hindi -lrb- bollywood -rrb- .
but the release of my sweet lord will change it ..
raju khagram , united kingdom i have always had mixed feelings about my sweet lord because of the embarassing lawsuit brought against it by the chiffons .
while mu guitar gently weeps is the definitive harrison work .
the other songs are great , but i was especially taken by pink 's number - a high-energy-take- no-prisoners-in-your-face jam !
robert del valle , usa of course that george 's song my sweet lord it ´ s a timeless track ! ! , i think the songs in the competition wo n't last much time like george 's .
my sweet lord has lasted more than 30 years and i 'm very sure will last another 30 and much more , and after that nobody will remember the songs , even the groups or singers in this week 's competition .
alberto nájera-garcía , puebla , pue .
méxico almost anything by george harrison is timeless and beautiful .
my sweet lord is expecially moving and is as relevant and great today as it was in ' 71 .
christina salomon , usa " few songs capture the spirit of george 's solo work " - funny , i thought he was found guilty of plagiarising this song from the chiffons ? !
hardly a solo effort .
andy , uk although i am big fan of george harrison and the beatles , am i the only person who thinks this song is not very good .
it is repetitive and lyrically poor .
he wrote lots of better songs that could have been released instead .
conal , england when paul mc cartney was singing silly love songs and john lennon was trying to give peace a chance , dear old george was singing to the lord with what must be the best song of that decade and runner up to yesterday the best song ever .
peter walker , berks long live george , great solo song from 1971 and his best solo lp .
sad to say he probably did lose it a little after all things must pass , but here was an ex-beatle at his peak. john king , uk it 's one of the songs that proves harrison was as good a songwriter , if not better than either mccartney or lennon .
and i doubt we 'll hear a slide guitar line as haunting as that again .
stuart , uk it 's okay , but nothing special .
i do n't remember anyone waxing lyrical before he died ian matthews , uk i think it is disgusting that someone has to die before they are appreciated , but apart fom that it is a good idea .
sandra harrigan , england good to see the record industry always ready to leap on a tragic death and make a bit of money .
robin , uk sorry , i hated this track first time around .
i do n't suppose it will be any different this time .
dougie lawson , uk as with other former beatles ' production , this song is good but does not reach the heights of george 's earlier work .
i would not go as far as labelling it a " timeless " tune , but it is undoubtedly better than 90 % of new songs -lrb- and its dreadful 2000 remake -rrb- .
andrea costa , italy my sweet lord is not one of the " golden oldies " that one hears so often on the radio .
only after the older generation have pushed it into the charts will the younger generation have the chance to hear it regularly and then also buy it .
alastair hood , germany it 's a good song but he wrote much better ones .
i think " here comes the sun " is far better but if it makes loads of money for charity -what the hell .
anna , uk i have great admiration for george - being a beatles fan but i would be suprised if this single tops the chart given the dross our teenagers are prepared to listen to these days .
it appears that who is singing is more important than what is being sung !
also , is n't there a cloud over this particular track re it was or may not have been written by george harrison ?
islwyn , wales the re-release of george harrison 's my sweet lord is a suitable memorial to this greatly missed man .
in death his talent has finally been regcognised .
i do so hope something and here comes the sun will also be re-released .
god bless and thank you george .
david arlow , uk it 's okay , but nothing special .
i do n't remember anyone waxing lyrical before he died .
this has more to do with george harrison 's death than anything else .
ian matthews , uk a timeless classic !
lesley harold , england the market for cds stretches right through the age ranges these days , many tracks get to no. 1 because middle-aged people buy them , the charts are now not solely about young people .
i know there are people who will complain that this is a non-christian song , but when i used to hear it as a child i always assumed it was a christian song anyway and i am sure many people will this time round , so there will be spin-off for all monotheistic religions .
maybe it should be classified simply as a ' spiritual ' song with the listener putting their own interpretation on who it refers to .
keir , uk glad to hear that this song is going to be re-released , i heard it being played on the radio on the sunday morning after george harrison 's death and forgot how happy and uplifting this song is , to me its real ' feel good ' music. stephen lindsay , belfast-n.ireland i must admit the " my sweet lord / i wish i was a pirate " was a much better version !
lee carter , uk ' something ' would have been a better choice or ' what is life ? '
my sweet lord is awful and should be consigned into the bin along with lennon 's ' imagine ' .
sassy , england a beautiful song that reminds us that god is the only important thing in life .
a message of love in a fighting world .
our sweet lord bless you george .
cecilia and cristina , argentina nice song - but uncomfortable with the religious bit .
he found the religion he was happy with and then started preaching .
luigi , uk it was a dreary dirge thirty years ago richard stansfield , uk those who suggest that " my sweet lord " is an inappropriate choice for a charity single because of the plagiarism suit are wrong .
after losing the case george bought the rights to " he 's so fine " outright , so no payments to any other songwriters will have to be made from the single 's proceeds -lrb- also , george did n't write " got my mind set on you " it 's a cover ! ! -rrb- .
yes , record companies are cynical , but so what ?
this re-release is still a fine tribute to george whatever the motives of the men in suits & hard up children around the world will benefit .
i bought it today , i hope it gets to number 1 , i 'm enjoying hearing it on the radio & only wish george was still here to bless us with more great guitar in the future .
rest in peace dear friend , we miss you ...
paul kindred , uk dear mr slim , why do you bother tormenting us by ' doing a michael jackson ' and releasing the umpteenth single of your bad third album ?
why ca n't you take your wife and your money and retire gracefully ?
mike , uk nothing more than a bland advertisment for the hare krishna movement .
unoriginal melody and repetitive lyrics .
i personally rate it as one of the most pathetic of harrisons solo efforts .
methinks it only got to number 1 as it was riding off the success of the beatles .
why not try looking at " when we was fab " or " something " or even " norwegian wood " for some classic songwriting / dry humour !
sadly this effort will probably get to number 1 .
sorry george it 's nothing personal , but if thats considered your best solo effort , lennon & mccartney really did n't have much to worry about !
paul turner , scotland is n't it strange how some people can become unreasonably feted in death ?
my sweet lord is a dreadful song - it 's the sort of thing i used to write aged 14 and would be too embarrassed to play to my friends .
it 's almost one held chord with a pathetic , uninspired melody over it .
and if you had put it on a pub jukebox two months ago , people would have demanded it be turned off .
just because he is no longer with us , we do n't have to lose our heads .
we all know who the talent was in the beatles , and he too is sadly dead .
the other three were largely passengers .
and let 's not forget harrison is the man who also gave us got my mind set on you .
enough said .
alex large , britain yes it is a great song , but it is not his best solo work even if it is his most marketable .
buy the reissue of his album " all things must pass " instead .
edward haworth , uk one of the great number ones , a truly universal song .
it owes more to oh happy day than he 's so fine - it 's a gospel song .
it would be wonderful to see it at number one again .
gordon hastie , scotland why bother re-releasing ?
it 's available in any record store to anyone who really has the need to buy it .
frankly " my sweet lord " is an old , tired song whose only value is nostalgia .
let it go .
linda , canada it was a dreary dirge thirty years ago .
time has not improved it .
richard stansfield , uk why is it that when george harrison sings about his lord , it is considered hip - but when cliff richard sings about jesus people snort and scoff ?
kira , usa my sweet lord is a timeless number one song .
george 's new version on the all things must pass cd is too .
every time that song ends , time stands still .
george knew how to make your heart dance .
hari krishna my sweet george , sherry pietras , usa people have often viewed ' my sweet lord ' as being plagiarised from the chiffons hit ' he 's so fine ' .
not many people remember that george could easily have sued the jam for their number 1 song ' start ' , which was a blatant rip-off of his song ' taxman ' .
jeremy , usa -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- my sweet lord is one of the greatest songs written in history .
it demonstrates what good music can do and what effect it has on us .
pierre , monaco brilliant .
george was just that .
a driving and extremely innovative force behind the beatles .
" my sweet lord " is just a beautiful piece .
while most others will fade away , george and the beatles will withstand the test of time .
ted , usa i am continually disappointed by human nature .
my sweet lord is a track that touches my heart and draws my ear constantly , but why does it take george 's death to provoke this re-release , and the giving of the proceeds to charity ?
this seems to me to be a cynical exercise in public relations , riding the handy passing wave of all the publicity surround george 's tragic departure .
i ca n't quite put my finger on it , but something about this situation simply does n't gel .
great song though , george .
miss you terribly .
warren loveridge , new zealand why is it that when george harrison sings about his lord , it is considered hip - but when cliff richard sings about his lord -lrb- jesus -rrb- people snort and scoff , ridicule him , and say it 's boring old drivel ?
not trying to pour cold water on george 's memory , but cliff has done more to promote his god and his country than ol ' george ever did .

the new year brings a host of new singles , including a re-release of george harrison 's my sweet lord .
also released on monday are the chemical brothers ' star guitar , new band black rebel motorcycle club 's love burns , pop diva pink 's latest , get the party started and fat boy slim 's retox .
the bbc 's nigel packer said of my sweet lord : " few songs capture the spirit of george 's solo work as well as this gentle anthem from 1971 . "
but what do you think ?
is it a timeless track ?
what about the rest of this week 's competition ?
my sweet lord is a timeless classic from an album full of brilliant songs made by an excellent musician but most of all an outstanding human being .
terry harbron , england songs like my sweet lord will never cease to sound fresh .
i still have my original vinyl copy on the apple label , with a great b side what is life .
i ¿ m looking forward to it being back in the charts .
tim , uk yes , one of the most inspirational songs of all time .
huck jordan , us virgin islands my sweet lord is an uplifting , beautiful track .
all those acoustic guitars and masses of voices .
gorgeous .
it would have made a wonderful christmas release .
god bless you george !
pete tucker , uk my sweet lord is an example of what a simple well-structured song may achieve raul arreola chapa , mexico as timeless as its subject .
r richards , usa serene and soothing .
peter foster , usa my sweet lord is an example of what a simple well-structured song may achieve .
its sensitive harmonics make you want to grab an acoustic guitar on the spot .
however , i 'm not sure whether g.h. enjoyed the success of this song due to the long legal battle that the song provoked .
raul arreola chapa , mexico my sweet lord is indeed a timeless classic !
the song really was a statement of who george was and what he believed in .
of all the meaningless songs out these days , it is great to have such a powerful song back on the air .
tony s. , usa proved in court to be a blatant riff off from the chiffons " he 's so fine " .
therefore does n't exactly show much originality does it ?
andy shanks , uk i think george harrisons single will get to number one easy , i think it is a great record , i was 13 when it first came out .
i will be buying it .
graham powell , uk although i am 24 i had never heard the song until after georges ' death .
from the first time i heard it i absolutely fell in love with the song .
i would say that on this point alone it must be considered timeless .
i do n't usually buy singles but i shall definitely be buying this one !
adrian manic , uk what a fitting tribute it would be if the song got to number one in the charts chris o 'donoghue , uk ca n't we forget about the beatles now ?
look at the fuss the bbc made of acid house .
well , what were half of the beatles records about ?
the world has grown up since the 60s .
no-one -lrb- who 's worth listening to -rrb- cares about what paul mccartney or yoko ono have to say .
why do n't they just do like ringo and fade away with some respect intact ?
j roberts , england i think my sweet lord is a wonderful song , which i was too young to buy when it came out , so i 'm seizing the opportunity now .
it 's also a great way to celebrate george 's genius , which was n't always recognised when he was alive .
what 's more , i believe , although it 's not often been stated in the news lately , that although george lost the lawsuit over plagiarising my sweet lord from the chiffons ' he 's so fine , he subsequently bought the rights to he 's so fine , so that he owned both songs free and clear .
his way of making things all right with the karma police ?
lucy , london , england i find the song very objectional because it is worship of someone other than god .
hari krishner is not god .
if the bbc played a hymn of worship to the lord god on the radio / tv as part of entertainment they would get loads of comments and objections .
brian reid , uk is it really 31 years since we first heard george harrison 's timeless classic ?
what a fitting tribute it would be if the song got to number one in the charts .
how sad it is that we never recognise how great people are until they die .
the other new releases can not compete but maybe it is unfair to even ask them to .
chris o 'donoghue , uk it was beautiful on its original release and still sounds amazing today felix , uk i still think that it sounds like " he 's so fine " ! ! !
john mills , uk another cash-in .
every time someone dies , their greatest number one is re-released -lrb- unless you are royalty , in which case elton john 's greatest number one gets re-released . -rrb-
the british public love to openly mourn strangers ' deaths , and this gives a cynical pop industry fuel enough to milk them .
krelling , uk this is timeless alright , because of the power of the message .
it is a call from the heart to lord krishna .
george harrison 's passing is very sad but his relationship with krishna is here for us all to witness again with the re-release of my sweet lord .
andy jordan , england as for competition to the re-release of my sweet lord ...
the chemical brothers are pretty good and my old mate quentin -lrb- aka norman -rrb- cook is n't short on talent .
however , just when we all thought that the mid eighties was the worst period for music since the second ice age , the early 2000s happened .
my sweet lord is one of the all time greats - no contest .
frank , uk my sweet lord is a beautiful track .
it was beautiful on its original release and still sounds amazing today .
truly timeless .
felix , uk it is very sad that he is remembered by a song he " borrowed " from the chiffons and not one he wrote himself -lrb- like " got my mind set on you " -rrb- .
al , uk harrison 's track holds fond memories for me .
i welcome its re-release .
the rest will be the usual dross bar , perhaps , fbs 's single .
pepe , uk surely a more suitable tribute release would have been the title track from his first solo album all things must pass mick ferris , uk george was great while in the beatles , but afterwards it was all downhill .
my sweet lord has the same bit for the chorus as the verse , and sounds very repetitive .
i remember reading somewhere that the melody of harrison 's my sweet lord was taken from the song of another writer , and harrison had to pay compensation from his royalties .
this song exemplifies how harrison was out of touch with his audience .
during his disastrous us tour of the early 1970s , he would ask the audience to chant hare krishna for several minutes at a time .
great entertainment .
andrew strong , uk is my sweet lord a timeless track ?
yes .
should it be re-released ?
no .
why ?
if emi is so concerned about donating the proceeds to charity , why not donate the 2002 proceeds from all things must pass ?
emi is clearly hoping to capitalise on the success of the single to boost sales of harrison 's emi-apple output .
corporate altruism not only does n't exist ; it 's a contradiction in terms .
even in death harrison is living in the material world .
is n't it a pity !
cyril , canada i think the song my sweet lord is a fantastic track , that really should have been released in time for christmas .
it evokes loving , friendly , neighbourly thoughts , that many songs that are around now do not , but actually cause frustration and anger instead .
i will be buying one when it is out .
sam bird , uk considering the lost plagiarism case with the publishers of the chiffons ' 1964 hit she 's so fine -lrb- which has an almost identical melody to my sweet lord -rrb- , surely a more suitable tribute release would have been the title track from his first solo album all things must pass , a beautiful , and far more original song than my sweet lord .
mick ferris , uk i guess the bbc will give this hari krishna record plenty of airplay whilst continuing to ignore really good christian contemporary music keith waters , uk my sweet lord is a beautiful song with a simple but important message .
the most impressive thing about the song is the sincerity .
few artists have the skill to write this sort of song well .
a classic !
richard mands , uk nothing wrong with my sweet lord but he did produce other material over the years and it would have been nice for something less stereotypical to have been chosen .
for example , his album cloud nine , produced by jeff lynn in 1987 , had a fine track called just for today .
and does n't a large proportion of the royalties from my sweet lord go to the writers of he 's so fine ?
alastair , uk george harrison 's my sweet lord is needed now more than ever .
let 's pray for each other and world peace !
patricia humphrey , usa my sweet lord is one of the greatest songs ever written .
it is great news that it is going to be re-released and should make a significant contribution to the material world foundation and a wonderul tribute to the memory of george harrison .
zoe , uk i guess the bbc will give this hari krishna record plenty of airplay whilst continuing to ignore really good christian contemporary music such as delirious ?
it is not that i have any thing against it musically , it 's just that the bbc seems frightened to acknowledge that equally valid music exists from a christian faith view .
sad but true , the bbc is biased .
keith waters , uk this song begins interesting and thereafter disappoints , right to the end .
it is repetitive , monotonous and unimaginative , just like humming a mantra over and over .
the relics are not intelligent , nor thought-provoking , nor significant .
this is a complete con and anyone buying the cd and listening to it deserves to lose their money and their time respectively .
mervyn hing , uk my sweet lord is a mediocre track , bland and boring trevor james , uk here goes the music industry again , anything goes in the pursuit of money .
odds-on number one record from someone who recently dies and the " charity " record comes out .
some money will go to charity , but a big chunk goes in the slimy pockets of the music mogels .
sick , sick , sick .
neil , uk the pathetic response of record companies , jumping onto any occasion where they can imagine a mid-term profit , shows how mean and ridiculous the music business is .
despite granting the earnings of this single to charity , they 'll be making loads of money by " reminding " people that george harrison has other recordings .
obviously , the record company wo n't donate any of the profits on other recordings ...
xavier sanchez , spain i think it 's a great idea , and i shall personally buy it , having bought the first record .
to give the proceeds to charity is good thing .
jennifer roberts , uk " my sweet lord " is a mediocre track , bland and boring .
it has only succeeded in the charts this time round due to the massive radio play it has received .
i do n't know the official figures , but i 'm sure it 's one of the most played songs at the moment on virgin radio .
surely he wrote something better ?
trevor james , uk great idea .
it will give us a chance to remember and appreciate george harrison .
nadeem fayyaz , usa considering this single caused george so many troubles in copyright suits i thought it would be better to take another song of his eddie , switzerland as someone who received sergeant pepper as a 21st birthday present - it was first released just before my birthday - i have been a lifelong follower of the beatles and their component parts .
george 's my sweet lord is a favourite and i am very happy to see it re-released .
i just hope that those who buy it will listen to its sentiments , and think about their own spirituality , and the fact that we are not alone in this world .
the words , however , can be misleading .
it does n't take so long to see or to find our lord .
the evidence is all around us .
it is up to us humans to make the most of that evidence - something we seem singularly unable to do for any length of time .
perhaps , however , george knew better - he was always the deeepest and most thinking of the four .
graham follett , uk ever since i was a child i have been told that the beatles were the best thing since sliced bread , something that has coloured my view of them .
this song , however , is beautiful .
having heard it a couple of times since george harrison died , it is constantly popping up in my mind .
a credit to its lasting quality .
andreas white , united kingdom my sweet lord is nothing but nauseating , twee , self-congratulatory rubbish to appeal to the self-righteous .
luckily i was n't born the last time around .
iain nicholson , uk a great record , but i wonder whether my sweet lord is the best choice for a charity record - much of the royalties will surely go to the authors of the chiffons hit " he 's so fine " which harrison plagiarised -lrb- albeit unconsciously -rrb- for my sweet lord .
gareth parry , uk my sweet lord is a song with real meaning and a timeless message , unlike much of the trash that is released nowadays .
if more " artists " had the same kind of god consciousness that george harrison had , and if more of the music we hear on a daily basis carried this same feeling of love for god , then the world would be a much better place .
my sweet lord should be played as much as possible this week , and all the weeks to come .
richard , uk would prefer a remake of his song that he wrote for patti boyd iris sharland , england considering this single caused george so many troubles in copyright suits i thought it would be better to take another song of his .
was n't " while my guitar gently weeps " one of his few songs ?
maybe not as popular like " got my mind set on you " or " my sweet lord " but at least is less controversial .
personally i suggest a re-release of " life of brian " ; after all rumour has it that it was only with george 's money that the film got produced in the first place .
eddie , switzerland is this song really relevant when the chart audience is so young ?
but it will get to no.1 of course .
jamie , uk it 's number one in my heart .
i wore my original vinyl out .
looking forward to hearing my sweet lord all over the air waves .
wish there were more music heros like george .
bob d. , usa my radio playing " my sweet lord " on my way home , after my happy weekend kayak fishing in malibu , california .
these few minutes are the happiest time of my life , i wish the station could repeat them several times . "
my sweet lord " - dear george , you are the greatest .
you enrich our life and make our life so enjoyable .
i am 54 , so you know it 's timeless !
robert sheu , california , usa it will be a wonderful tribute to a great musician and artist who is sadly missed to have it re-released .
gill goodsell , england utterly tedious .
andrew collyer , uk i do n't think that this is the best choice of song .
to me it sounds somewhat dated and rather miserable .
one of his more recent hits like " got my mind set on you " would have been much better .
it 's a more lifting song and dare i say , not a blatant rip-off of an old hit .
jason jones , england , uk andy shanks is wrong .
" my sweet lord " was proven in court to be a subconscious copy of the chiffons song .
admittedly he ended up paying up over the lawsuit , but do you think george would have done something as stupid as to deliberately copy the riff from " he 's so fine " when millions of people would have spotted this ?
paul , england would prefer a remake of his song that he wrote for patti boyd - lovely - but ca n't remember title .
iris sharland , england i was especially taken by pink 's number - a high-energy-take- no-prisoners-in-your-face jam !
robert del valle , usa shiny , insubstantial ear-candy .
morbid , uk i believe my sweet lord deserves to be number one for this week .
the single is the best thing i 've heard on the radio for a long time and puts a lot of so called modern music to shame .
it would have been somewhat crass to put the single out for christmas and now as it is the new year and the fact that the proceeds will go to a good cause reinforces its appeal and now it can be number one for all the right reasons .
well done to all concerned .
alex , uk george harrison wrote and performed some beautiful songs , but this is n't one of them .
my sweet lord is a repetitive dirge , and it was proved in court that he plagiarised the writers of a near identical tune .
why not " something " or one of his truly great hits instead of this popularist rubbish ?
tony clare , uk one of the most beautiful rip offs of our time .
reckon noel gallagher would be jealous of that one .
george is missed .
james bate , uk i have never bought an album or a single , which is not in hindi -lrb- bollywood -rrb- .
but the release of my sweet lord will change it ..
raju khagram , united kingdom i have always had mixed feelings about my sweet lord because of the embarassing lawsuit brought against it by the chiffons .
while mu guitar gently weeps is the definitive harrison work .
the other songs are great , but i was especially taken by pink 's number - a high-energy-take- no-prisoners-in-your-face jam !
robert del valle , usa of course that george 's song my sweet lord it ´ s a timeless track ! ! , i think the songs in the competition wo n't last much time like george 's .
my sweet lord has lasted more than 30 years and i 'm very sure will last another 30 and much more , and after that nobody will remember the songs , even the groups or singers in this week 's competition .
alberto nájera-garcía , puebla , pue .
méxico almost anything by george harrison is timeless and beautiful .
my sweet lord is expecially moving and is as relevant and great today as it was in ' 71 .
christina salomon , usa " few songs capture the spirit of george 's solo work " - funny , i thought he was found guilty of plagiarising this song from the chiffons ? !
hardly a solo effort .
andy , uk although i am big fan of george harrison and the beatles , am i the only person who thinks this song is not very good .
it is repetitive and lyrically poor .
he wrote lots of better songs that could have been released instead .
conal , england when paul mc cartney was singing silly love songs and john lennon was trying to give peace a chance , dear old george was singing to the lord with what must be the best song of that decade and runner up to yesterday the best song ever .
peter walker , berks long live george , great solo song from 1971 and his best solo lp .
sad to say he probably did lose it a little after all things must pass , but here was an ex-beatle at his peak. john king , uk it 's one of the songs that proves harrison was as good a songwriter , if not better than either mccartney or lennon .
and i doubt we 'll hear a slide guitar line as haunting as that again .
stuart , uk it 's okay , but nothing special .
i do n't remember anyone waxing lyrical before he died ian matthews , uk i think it is disgusting that someone has to die before they are appreciated , but apart fom that it is a good idea .
sandra harrigan , england good to see the record industry always ready to leap on a tragic death and make a bit of money .
robin , uk sorry , i hated this track first time around .
i do n't suppose it will be any different this time .
dougie lawson , uk as with other former beatles ' production , this song is good but does not reach the heights of george 's earlier work .
i would not go as far as labelling it a " timeless " tune , but it is undoubtedly better than 90 % of new songs -lrb- and its dreadful 2000 remake -rrb- .
andrea costa , italy my sweet lord is not one of the " golden oldies " that one hears so often on the radio .
only after the older generation have pushed it into the charts will the younger generation have the chance to hear it regularly and then also buy it .
alastair hood , germany it 's a good song but he wrote much better ones .
i think " here comes the sun " is far better but if it makes loads of money for charity -what the hell .
anna , uk i have great admiration for george - being a beatles fan but i would be suprised if this single tops the chart given the dross our teenagers are prepared to listen to these days .
it appears that who is singing is more important than what is being sung !
also , is n't there a cloud over this particular track re it was or may not have been written by george harrison ?
islwyn , wales the re-release of george harrison 's my sweet lord is a suitable memorial to this greatly missed man .
in death his talent has finally been regcognised .
i do so hope something and here comes the sun will also be re-released .
god bless and thank you george .
david arlow , uk it 's okay , but nothing special .
i do n't remember anyone waxing lyrical before he died .
this has more to do with george harrison 's death than anything else .
ian matthews , uk a timeless classic !
lesley harold , england the market for cds stretches right through the age ranges these days , many tracks get to no. 1 because middle-aged people buy them , the charts are now not solely about young people .
i know there are people who will complain that this is a non-christian song , but when i used to hear it as a child i always assumed it was a christian song anyway and i am sure many people will this time round , so there will be spin-off for all monotheistic religions .
maybe it should be classified simply as a ' spiritual ' song with the listener putting their own interpretation on who it refers to .
keir , uk glad to hear that this song is going to be re-released , i heard it being played on the radio on the sunday morning after george harrison 's death and forgot how happy and uplifting this song is , to me its real ' feel good ' music. stephen lindsay , belfast-n.ireland i must admit the " my sweet lord / i wish i was a pirate " was a much better version !
lee carter , uk ' something ' would have been a better choice or ' what is life ? '
my sweet lord is awful and should be consigned into the bin along with lennon 's ' imagine ' .
sassy , england a beautiful song that reminds us that god is the only important thing in life .
a message of love in a fighting world .
our sweet lord bless you george .
cecilia and cristina , argentina nice song - but uncomfortable with the religious bit .
he found the religion he was happy with and then started preaching .
luigi , uk it was a dreary dirge thirty years ago richard stansfield , uk those who suggest that " my sweet lord " is an inappropriate choice for a charity single because of the plagiarism suit are wrong .
after losing the case george bought the rights to " he 's so fine " outright , so no payments to any other songwriters will have to be made from the single 's proceeds -lrb- also , george did n't write " got my mind set on you " it 's a cover ! ! -rrb- .
yes , record companies are cynical , but so what ?
this re-release is still a fine tribute to george whatever the motives of the men in suits & hard up children around the world will benefit .
i bought it today , i hope it gets to number 1 , i 'm enjoying hearing it on the radio & only wish george was still here to bless us with more great guitar in the future .
rest in peace dear friend , we miss you ...
paul kindred , uk dear mr slim , why do you bother tormenting us by ' doing a michael jackson ' and releasing the umpteenth single of your bad third album ?
why ca n't you take your wife and your money and retire gracefully ?
mike , uk nothing more than a bland advertisment for the hare krishna movement .
unoriginal melody and repetitive lyrics .
i personally rate it as one of the most pathetic of harrisons solo efforts .
methinks it only got to number 1 as it was riding off the success of the beatles .
why not try looking at " when we was fab " or " something " or even " norwegian wood " for some classic songwriting / dry humour !
sadly this effort will probably get to number 1 .
sorry george it 's nothing personal , but if thats considered your best solo effort , lennon & mccartney really did n't have much to worry about !
paul turner , scotland is n't it strange how some people can become unreasonably feted in death ?
my sweet lord is a dreadful song - it 's the sort of thing i used to write aged 14 and would be too embarrassed to play to my friends .
it 's almost one held chord with a pathetic , uninspired melody over it .
and if you had put it on a pub jukebox two months ago , people would have demanded it be turned off .
just because he is no longer with us , we do n't have to lose our heads .
we all know who the talent was in the beatles , and he too is sadly dead .
the other three were largely passengers .
and let 's not forget harrison is the man who also gave us got my mind set on you .
enough said .
alex large , britain yes it is a great song , but it is not his best solo work even if it is his most marketable .
buy the reissue of his album " all things must pass " instead .
edward haworth , uk one of the great number ones , a truly universal song .
it owes more to oh happy day than he 's so fine - it 's a gospel song .
it would be wonderful to see it at number one again .
gordon hastie , scotland why bother re-releasing ?
it 's available in any record store to anyone who really has the need to buy it .
frankly " my sweet lord " is an old , tired song whose only value is nostalgia .
let it go .
linda , canada it was a dreary dirge thirty years ago .
time has not improved it .
richard stansfield , uk why is it that when george harrison sings about his lord , it is considered hip - but when cliff richard sings about jesus people snort and scoff ?
kira , usa my sweet lord is a timeless number one song .
george 's new version on the all things must pass cd is too .
every time that song ends , time stands still .
george knew how to make your heart dance .
hari krishna my sweet george , sherry pietras , usa people have often viewed ' my sweet lord ' as being plagiarised from the chiffons hit ' he 's so fine ' .
not many people remember that george could easily have sued the jam for their number 1 song ' start ' , which was a blatant rip-off of his song ' taxman ' .
jeremy , usa -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- my sweet lord is one of the greatest songs written in history .
it demonstrates what good music can do and what effect it has on us .
pierre , monaco brilliant .
george was just that .
a driving and extremely innovative force behind the beatles .
" my sweet lord " is just a beautiful piece .
while most others will fade away , george and the beatles will withstand the test of time .
ted , usa i am continually disappointed by human nature .
my sweet lord is a track that touches my heart and draws my ear constantly , but why does it take george 's death to provoke this re-release , and the giving of the proceeds to charity ?
this seems to me to be a cynical exercise in public relations , riding the handy passing wave of all the publicity surround george 's tragic departure .
i ca n't quite put my finger on it , but something about this situation simply does n't gel .
great song though , george .
miss you terribly .
warren loveridge , new zealand why is it that when george harrison sings about his lord , it is considered hip - but when cliff richard sings about his lord -lrb- jesus -rrb- people snort and scoff , ridicule him , and say it 's boring old drivel ?
not trying to pour cold water on george 's memory , but cliff has done more to promote his god and his country than ol ' george ever did .

" i searched it thoroughly and studied it carefully looking for problems or flaws , " he said .
" i could n't find anything .
it is brilliant design , " he told the bbc world service programme go digital .
the new imac , unveiled last week after two years in development , combines innovative design with powerful multimedia features .
the new model has been likened to an anglepoise lamp , with the flat panel attached to the dome-shaped base via a pivoting arm .
' it 's very impressive ' " when i first saw the machine , i thought it was going to be hard to connect to it , hard to expand , " said dr norman .
don norman : impressed " when you first look at the machine , it does n't even look like it has a cd drive .
but if you look in detail , it 's very impressive , it 's all there . "
apple is hoping the new imac will appeal broadly to consumers and prompt existing imac owners to buy a new one .
public reaction has been mixed , with some viewing the new imac as rather odd .
the new imac 15 " flat screen 700 or 800mhz g4 processor 40gb or 60gb hard drive optional cd / dvd writer 2 firewire and 3 usb ports but dr norman argues this is not something that should worry apple .
" some people may dislike it .
but that 's a sign of good design , " he said .
" if you do n't provoke strong opinions , you have n't done your job . "
three all-white models will be available , at $ 1,299 , $ 1,499 and $ 1,799 .
apple expects to ship the top-of-the-line imac by the end of the month .
the midrange model is expected to be available in february and the entry-level imac in march .
apple has 5 % of the pc market in the us and 3 % worldwide .
but historically its designs have influenced developments in the pc market .
invisible computers dr norman sees the new imac as an example of technology designed to be simple and easy to use .
some may dislike the design he is annoyed by the unnecessary complexity of many of today 's products .
his ultimate aim is to have technology like computers disappear from sight and be replaced by a family of information appliances communicating wirelessly with each other .
" what you really want in the home is a modular system scattered throughout the house , all powered by a central computer , just like you have a furnace or a hot water heater in a closet , " he explains .
" apple is the best company in the world to make this because apple understands consumers , understands design and understands computers .
dr norman is professor of computer science at northwestern university in the us and is a former vice president of the advanced technology group at apple computer .
he is the author or co-author of 13 books , with translations into twelve languages , including the design of everyday things and the invisible computer .

" we hope the japanese government will heed the concerns of asian economies and will maintain the stability of the yen and avoid a domino effect of the depreciation of the yen in asia , " said dai xianglong , governor of the people 's bank of china , the country 's central bank .

japan has tacitly opted for weak-yen policy this year , in the hope of stimulating exports , and its currency has fallen to three-year lows .
but neighbouring states have voiced concerns that the move could undermine currency stability around the region , sparking a series of competitive currency devaluations .
nervous neighbours in the past few days , a number of asia countries , most forcibly malaysia , have expressed concern .
but it is the attitude of china - asia 's second-biggest economy - that will prove most decisive , observers have said .
the people 's bank was in contact with its counterpart in tokyo and had expressed concerns over the depreciation of the yen , mr dai said .
he insisted that it would herald no immediate change in chinese currency policy .
the people 's bank would continue to allow the controlled fluctuation of the chinese yuan in the long term , mr dai said .
the yuan is at present only partially convertible , and therefore does not float freely .
steady as she goes strong economic fundamentals mean that the yuan should avoid devaluation , mr dai said .
" the economy is in good shape in terms of the balance of payments , " he said .
" china 's foreign direct investment rose 15 % last year .
china still enjoys a trade surplus and -lsb- foreign currency -rsb- reserves are growing .
" based on these factors , the exchange rate will be stable . "
china plans gradually to make the yuan more freely convertible as membership of the world trade organisation gathers pace , but the pace and extent of liberalisation has long been a matter for debate among asian investors .

the abundance and taxonomic breadth of the animals we found was quite a surprise linda kuhnz , moss landing marine labs biologist " this was an epic journey in search of geological knowledge from a remote corner of the earth , " said peter michael , of the university of tulsa , us .
" we have completely unexpected results , " said charles langmuir , of columbia university .
" the ocean ridge below the arctic is completely unique .
we found 12 new volcanoes where we expected to find none , and we found unexpected and abundant hydrothermal activity . "
the researchers believe they have found new organisms living around hydrothermal vents - cracks in the ocean floor through which hot mineral-rich waters flow - where none were expected .
the geology of the region will change our understanding of how the earth works .
unique fascination for good reason , the gakkel ridge is one of the least explored places on our world .
it extends over 1,500 kilometres -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- through the eurasian basin of the arctic ocean , from north of greenland to the laptev sea off siberia .
it is the deepest and most remote mid-ocean ridge on our planet - a place where the sea floor is being pushed apart by upwellings of magma from inside the earth .
the ridge , however , expands very slowly - at less than one centimetre a year .
the spreading ridges in the pacific ocean , widen 20 times faster , or about as fast as your fingernails grow .
but despite , or because of , its slow growth , the gakkel ridge has a unique fascination .
the problem has been getting at it to study it .
it is five km -lrb- three miles -rrb- beneath the ice cover of one of the most inhospitable seas on earth .
henry dick , of the woods hole oceanographic institution , said : " the ridge is unique because it is virtually unsampled .
it is located in a very hostile environment , and logistics have prevented us from getting there until now . "
scientists are analysing the results of the first full-scale expedition to the region which took place last year .
active surprise from the end of july to early october 2001 , researchers aboard the new icebreaker the united states coast guard healy and the german research vessel polarstern undertook the first systematic sampling of the gakkel ridge .
" we accomplished easily a factor of two more than we planned , " said dr michael .
small robotic submarines , called miniature autonomous plume recorders -lrb- maprs -rrb- , were deployed on a trawl wire during sea-floor dredging and drilling operations , in order to identify sites of hydrothermal venting , by looking in the water for the chemicals these remarkable geological features spew into the ocean .
the scientists involved in the research programme said the extent of the hydrothermal activity they detected was remarkable , especially since it was thought the prevalence of venting was related to the rate at which the sea floor spreads .
" our discovery of these signals clearly show that hydrothermal vents similar to those present on faster-spreading mid-ocean ridges are present in abundance here , too " said henrietta edmonds , of the university of texas .
new organisms according to charles langmuir the expedition " found more hydrothermal activity on this cruise than in 20 years of exploration on the mid-atlantic ridge " .
" these exciting discoveries on gakkel ridge , " said peter michael , " pave the way for future expeditions that will map the vents and may discover completely new organisms . "
linda kuhnz , a biologist from moss landing marine labs in california , who participated in the expedition , added : " the abundance and taxonomic breadth of the animals we found was quite a surprise . "
the isolation of the arctic ocean has long intrigued biologists .
they hope that some of the samples recovered will help answer the question of whether the lifeforms and ecosystems in the arctic resemble those from the atlantic ocean or pacific ocean , or whether they have evolved separately .

warhol 's instantly-recognisable images of campbell 's soup and can and marilyn monroe will be plastered across 400sq ft poster sites in the city from wednesday .
the three-part tv series andy warhol : the complete picture begins on 27 january and coincides with a major restrospective of the artist 's work at the capital 's tate modern from 7 february .
channel 4 's marketing manager nick stringer said : " the new andy warhol series presented us with a great opportunity to do something original and surprising and , to be honest , anything you do to promote warhol demands you think differently . "
low brow andy warhol was born andrew warhola in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , in 1928 establishing himself as a successful commercial artist in the 1950s .
in the 1960s warhol mixed the low brow world of consumer culture with the high brow world of art and his images quickly caught both the public 's and intellectual world 's imagination .
the artist died in 1987 after routine gall bladder surgery .
channel 4 was given permission to display warhol 's work on more than 50 billboards across london by the warhol foundation .
martin cribb from the warhol foundation said : " this poster campaign seems particularly apt because warhol always observed that pop was all around on billboards and hoardings , and he saw his work as reflecting the existing landscape . "
the tv series will feature interviews with more than 60 of warhol 's close friends , collaborators and admirers .

the three-part tv series andy warhol : the complete picture begins on 27 january and coincides with a major restrospective of the artist 's work at the capital 's tate modern from 7 february .
channel 4 's marketing manager nick stringer said : " the new andy warhol series presented us with a great opportunity to do something original and surprising and , to be honest , anything you do to promote warhol demands you think differently . "
low brow andy warhol was born andrew warhola in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , in 1928 establishing himself as a successful commercial artist in the 1950s .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- fast and ' reliable ' dvt test unveiled categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 15 january , 2002 , 11:07 gmt fast and ' reliable ' dvt test unveiled dvt is thought to affect people in cramped conditions british scientists say they have discovered a fast , accurate way to detect the potentially fatal deep vein thrombosis -lrb- dvt -rrb- , which can occur during long-distance flights .
the sophisticated scanning method removes the need to use invasive techniques to monitor blood flow to detect a blockage .
experts use magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging -lrb- mrdti -rrb- to reveal the blood clot .
we believe the future application of mrdti will be enormously valuable in the early diagnosis and monitoring of dvt professor alan moody , university of nottingham scientists at the university of nottingham , who developed the method , said it could be particularly helpful for pregnant women and travellers .
professor alan moody , who led the research team , said : " the great advantages that mrdti has over other methods to detect thrombosis are that it is non-invasive , quick and reliable .
" mrdti produces good images of the pelvis and the pregnant mother would not need x-rays for us to see the blood vessels . "
the current method of detecting dvt is with venography , in which a catheter is inserted into the veins , and ultrasound .
the condition can be particularly difficult to diagnose in pregnancy if it originates in the pelvis , where it is hard to detect .
early diagnosis dvt has been dubbed " economy class syndrome " because it is associated with cramped conditions on aircraft , but experts say it can occur during any mode of transport after long periods of immobility .
dvt can be fatal if the blood clot , or part of it , dislodges and moves to the lungs or brain .
mrdti is said to be very sensitive and allows radiologists to diagnose and treat the condition at a very early stage before symptoms such as leg pains develop .
a study , funded by the british heart foundation , and published in the medical journal the annals of internal medicine , tested the method on 101 people .
the results were compared with standard tests and were found to be just as accurate .
professor moody said : " we believe the future application of mrdti will be enormously valuable in the early diagnosis and monitoring of dvt . "
the chances of developing dvt for most travellers are thought to be quite low .
however , passengers who are overweight or obese , or those who drink heavily or smokers with existing problems , have an increased risk .
the death of a 28-year-old woman from dvt after a flight from australia to britain in october 2000 raised awareness of the condition .
airlines and doctors advise travellers on long-haul flights to exercise their legs , drink plenty of water and not to drink too much alcohol .
compression stockings help reduce the risk of dvt .

home secretary david blunkett announced in october that the home office and department of health would draw up new guidelines for supplying heroin on prescription to addicts .
the idea has gained also favour amongst some senior police officers , who believe it could reduce the amount of drug-related crime .
but the royal college of general practitioners told a session of the home affairs select committee on tuesday that it is against the idea .
we would not be getting to the route of the problem dr claire gerada , rcgp doctors ' reluctance to prescribe heroin is emphasised by the findings of a survey by imperial college in london .
it found that fewer than half of those entitled to hold a licence to administer the drug had applied for one .
the survey also found that the home office list of prescribers was inaccurate .
many who supposely had licences did not , others could not be traced .
police backing at the moment , around 300 addicts around the country are prescribed heroin .
some senior police officers have called for the scheme to be widened .
last week , chief superintendent john issac of devon and cornwall police told bbc 's newsnight : " there will always be a debate among the medical profession about the ethics of prescribing heroin .
" but from a police officer 's point of view , i have to say that if it reduces crime , reduces the number of victims , that has to be a very serious consideration .
and i would support it . "
the association of chief police officers said the area was " something it was looking at " .
but the rcgp said it was concerned about spending up to £ 15,000 per year funding heroin prescriptions for a user , money it said could be better spent in improving treatment programmes to help addicts stop taking drugs altogether .
dr claire gerada , a south london gp who has run a clinic for drugs misusers for the last 10 years , will attend the session on the college 's behalf .
she told bbc news online she was worried that decisions about treatment were being considered without the input of doctors .
" my fundamental concern is that we would be running the risk of creating addicts for life , " she said .
' pie-in-the-sky ' she added that increased prescription of heroin would not be the solution for the drugs misusers .
" we would not be getting to the route of the problem .
we would just be colluding with them . "
dr gerada added that there was no need to increase the amount of heroin prescribed when methadone , the heroin substitute , was effective and a fifth of the cost of heroin .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- backed the rcgp .
dr rob barnett , a liverpool gp and member of the bma 's gps committee , said : " we have enough problems encouraging gps to prescribe methadone .
going down the route of telling them to prescribe heroin is pie-in-the-sky . "
christine glover , past president of the royal pharmaceutical society of great britain , also attended the select committee hearing .
she said pharmacists ' main concern was addressing problems which arise out of the current methadone prescribing procedures .
she told bbc news online she believed gps should be able to prescribe heroin , as long as they had adequate training and support .
" we have to recognise that there will be a cohort who will always be addicts and that 's probably the right cohort for this measure . "
training call dr andrew thompson , the nhs alliance 's special adviser on drug misuse , told the committee that gps and pharmacists need more training , resources and support to deal with the growing demands of treating drug addicts .
he said the problems of drug misuse and addiction were exacting an increasing toll on gps .
" addiction services have been traditionally an under-resourced area of an under-resourced speciality , psychiatry , and the users on the waiting lists , six months or more in places , are either left without a service , or are prescribed for by a few willing gps with little training , and no resource or remuneration for this . "
the select committee session is part of a long term inquiry into the effectiveness of the government 's drug policy .
the inquiry is due to end in february , with a report expected in the spring .
the home office has convened a meeting of experts to take place in february , which will update national guidance in a bid to minimise variations in practice around the country .

the simple aim is to avoid war between these nuclear-armed neighbours .
the tools are diplomacy and power .
right now we have to focus on the dangerous situation that is before us colin powell as india and pakistan have massed troops on their border , the united states has maintained a studied neutrality .
mr powell has sympathised with india , as it tries to root out what the indian government says is terrorism sponsored by pakistan .
but he has also given his warm endorsement to general pervez musharraf , as the pakistani leader has moved against militants based on pakistani territory .
difficult dennis kux of the woodrow wilson center says it is a very delicate diplomatic operation .
" we are trying to help general musharraf make this very difficult turning ... to shut down the jihad , really , against india in kashmir .
" it is particularly difficult for him because he , i think , in his heart is in favour of it .
" as he said in his speech , ' we ca n't give up on kashmir , it is in our blood ' . "
mr powell raced to endorse general musharraf 's weekend speech condemning terrorism , almost the moment it was made .
it was a " bold and principled " stand , said the secretary of state .
now his message to the indian government is that it should have patience , while the americans help to ensure actions continue to follow general musharraf 's words .
military build-up but so far mr powell has been careful not to call on india to scale down its military build-up .
" the indians have to make the judgement as to when they move their forces , " he said before leaving washington .
an end to the military confrontation is clearly the goal , but what then ?
is washington prepared to wade into the murky waters of the kashmir issue ?
in an interview with the bbc a few days ago , the secretary of state was characteristically cautious .
kashmir , he acknowledged was " a difficult issue " .
dialogue " i think it 's going to have to be part of a dialogue between the two nations in due course , " he went on .
" but right now we have to focus on the dangerous situation that is before us , and that is the mobilisation of forces that are in close proximity to one another , with the possibility of some sparks setting that off . "
it is as if colin powell is trying to take india and pakistan gently by the hand , moving them away from the danger of war , step by step .

" as he said in his speech , ' we ca n't give up on kashmir , it is in our blood ' . "
mr powell raced to endorse general musharraf 's weekend speech condemning terrorism , almost the moment it was made .
it was a " bold and principled " stand , said the secretary of state .
now his message to the indian government is that it should have patience , while the americans help to ensure actions continue to follow general musharraf 's words .
military build-up but so far mr powell has been careful not to call on india to scale down its military build-up .
the us secretary of state has not called on india to pull back troops " the indians have to make the judgement as to when they move their forces , " he said before leaving washington .
an end to the military confrontation is clearly the goal , but what then ?
is washington prepared to wade into the murky waters of the kashmir issue ?
in an interview with the bbc a few days ago , the secretary of state was characteristically cautious .
kashmir , he acknowledged was " a difficult issue " .
dialogue " i think it 's going to have to be part of a dialogue between the two nations in due course , " he went on .
" but right now we have to focus on the dangerous situation that is before us , and that is the mobilisation of forces that are in close proximity to one another , with the possibility of some sparks setting that off . "
it is as if colin powell is trying to take india and pakistan gently by the hand , moving them away from the danger of war , step by step .

this is one of the few places where peace activists from the two communities can meet .
they have formed a choir which they hope will help encourage ethnic harmony .
things are much better now , we salute each other and we even say hello turkish cypriot official ahmet sakilli " we build a base , " says lena mexelebi , the greek cypriot conductor .
" and we just help things go positively .
we do n't give solutions , we are not ... "
" politicians , " says her turkish counterpart caner ilgar .
but now even the politicians have agreed to talk .
the veteran leaders of the two communities on cyprus are embarking on what the united nations hopes will be several months of talks .
the aim by mid-summer is a settlement of one of the most intractable disputes in the world .
the greek cypriot president glafkos clerides is recognised internationally as the legitimate ruler of the whole island .
but the turkish cypriots in the north , led by rauf denktash , have declared independence , supported by 30,000 troops from mainland turkey .
since 1974 , the united nations has had to keep the two sides apart .
pyla is the only mixed community in the buffer zone , and it has had its share of problems .
there are plenty of people who do n't share the passion for contacts between the two communities .
the greek cafe is on one side of the village square , and the turkish coffee house on the other .
they do n't mix much , and it had taken four years of negotiations for local greek and turkish cypriot representatives to agree on a plan to build speed bumps to slow down the traffic on the main road .
the main turkish official in the village , ahmet sakilli , admits that he visited the greek café for the first time just a few weeks ago .
" things are much better now , we salute each other and we even say hello , " he said .
lingering doubts just across the square , the greek cypriots playing cards in the sun agree that the political thaw , which has seen mr clerides and mr denktash visit each other for the first time in a generation , has made life in the village a little easier .
but there are still grave doubts about whether cyprus can reach a solution without a little help from its friends .
" they need help from someone like bush say , or the british government , " says spirou kiriagos .
" if those two countries are moving things a bit , they can find a good solution for cyprus . "
the consensus on both sides of the square is that the main impetus for the renewed talks has been the greek cypriot government 's application for membership of the european union .
it is likely to be approved at the end of this year , and for the first time in a generation that sets a real deadline .
but no one expects it to be easy .
in both communities , there is a huge legacy of bitterness .
greek cypriot women dressed in black come to the checkpoint which divides north from south every saturday - still haunted by the past .
mothers want to know what happened to sons who disappeared 28 years ago .
just a short distance across the barbed wire , the turkish cypriots have set up a " museum of barbarism " in a house where a turkish cypriot family was killed in the early 1960s .
nationalists feed off the painful memories of a period when inter-communal violence left thousands dead or missing .
it makes the search for a permanent settlement all the more difficult .
abandoned villages and so the united nations is still here - keeping a watchful eye on turkish soldiers in the north , and on the greek cypriot national guard .
un troops patrol the buffer zone every day , through abandoned villages which are slowly collapsing .
it is not a place which inspires much optimism .
for all the talk of a solution in six months , there is little sign that political positions on either side have changed .
the greek cypriots insist that the basis for a solution must be a bi-communal federal state .
the turkish cypriots are still pushing for a much looser confederation of two sovereign states .
it is complicated , and neither side is giving much away before the talks begin in earnest .
but if cyprus does join the eu without a settlement in place , things are likely to get worse .
in the eyes of the world , turkish troops in the north would then be occupying part of the european union .
that is why international pressure for a settlement is growing .
no-one wants to have to deal with an even greater mess .
critical year if cyprus 's application is delayed in any way , greece has threatened to hold up the entire eu enlargement process .
on the other hand if cyprus is accepted as a member of the european union while the island remains divided , turkey has threatened to annex the north altogether .
on one thing everyone agrees - the eu application has changed the dynamics of a conflict which often seems frozen in time .
this will be a critical year .
but if the talks are to succeed both sides will have to compromise , and that will be a tough task on an island where history casts such a long shadow .

the approval of a government grant will lead to a fibre pulp facility being built at shotton paper 's deeside site which should mean an extra four million households being involved in recycling schemes .
it will also produce huge environmental benefits by greatly increasing the amount of paper recycled welsh assembly first minister rhodri morgan the project will turn waste into paper and is part of a government drive to increase recycling in the uk .
welsh assembly first minister rhodri morgan said it is a step in the right direction to achieving european directives .
" the proposed investment by the waste and resources action programme -lrb- wrap -rrb- will enhance the performance at shotton securing employment at the plant , " he said .
" it will also produce huge environmental benefits by greatly increasing the amount of paper recycled .
" this is a major part of the new waste strategy for wales and i hope that the new capacity will assist local authorities in wales to expand their own recycling operations . "
according to assembly statistics wales is near the bottom of the european league in waste management .
currently around 95 % of domestic rubbish in wales goes to landfill sites .
despite a series of government and eu targets , the proportion that is recycled has remained around 5 % .
to comply with eu directives , ministers want that to increase to 25 % by 2005 , rising to at least 33 % by 2015 .
bosses at the plant have said that this latest investment will have far reaching implications .
increased efficiency shotton paper 's managing director martin gale said : " it 's very significant for local authorities within a 100 mile radius .
" they now have an outlet available to them for recycling newspapers and magazines . "
the plant 's finland-based parent company , upm kymmene , say the investment will increase efficiency at the plant .
the development means the company will be able to take an additional 320,000 tonnes of recovered newspapers and magazines every year .
upm have said it is unlikely to lead to the creation of any more jobs at shotton however the move has been seen as a significant boost to the local economy .
alyn and deeside mp mark tami said : " this is great news for shotton paper , the company is going from strength to strength and this is an extremely significant victory . "
many local authorities will be assisted in meeting their national recycling targets wrap chairman vic cocker the new recycled fibre pulp facility is due to be commissioned in september 2003 and is expected to be up to full production by april 2004 .
wrap chairman vic cocker said the recycling facility would help local authorities become more environmentally friendly .
" many local authorities will be assisted in meeting their national recycling targets by the early and guaranteed provision of this new capacity , " he said .
the investment will convert shotton paper , the uk 's largest newsprint mill , to use 100 % recycled fibre .
to ensure the efficient flow of reusable fibre from the new local authority recycling schemes - where there are currently low levels of paper recovery from the waste stream - contract agreements and collection development will commence immediately .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- nhs patients ' opt for private surgery ' categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 15 january , 2002 , 11:34 gmt nhs patients ' opt for private surgery ' patients are giving up holidays to buy surgery around 100,000 uninsured nhs patients are paying for private surgery because they have waited so long for treatment , according to a survey .
researchers claim that eight out of ten doctors believe the number of patients paying for operations because of long waiting lists has grown over the last five years .
they also said 40,000 people waiting to be seen as hospital outpatients were admitted as emergency cases in december because their condition deteriorated .
the study of 400 gps , by medix uk plc , says the workload of family practitioners is dominated by patients whose condition is worsening as they wait to see a specialist .
mike stone , director of the patients ' association , told bbc news online the situation would not improve until the nhs " gets its act together by cutting waiting times " .
appointments according to the survey unnecessary appointments involving people waiting for surgery were a serious problem , with gps coping with more than 100,000 such cases in december .
there is no doubt that gps are spending far too much of their valuable time in efforts to get patients onto waiting lists dr rino coladangelo medix said the appointments , affecting nine out of ten doctors , would not have been required if the patients had received the surgery they required .
a similar number had tried to get patients seen at a hospital sooner because their condition worsened in december .
almost 80 % said half of more of their recent referrals to outpatients were asked to wait too long to see a specialist .
the same proportion of gps thought their local hospitals discharged patients too soon after operations to make way for new cases .
a clear majority had treated patients because they had been sent home too early .
no choice mr stone said he was unsurprised by the findings , adding that more and more patients were realising the only way they could get treatment was to pay for it themselves .
he said : " people , quite rightly , are making decisions - rather than perhaps taking a two week holiday , they 're thinking ' well , my health is more important ' .
" we have heard of patients who have had to have their houses remortgaged to get the operation . "
mr stone said many patients , particularly those needing potentially life-saving operations , felt they had no choice but to find the money for private treatment .
' valuable time ' dr rino coladangelo , medix chief executive and himself a family doctor with 20 years experience , said the survey revealed the real experiences of gps and their patients .
he said : " there is no doubt that gps are spending far too much of their valuable time in efforts to get patients onto waiting lists , to expedite appointments and to cope with premature discharge . "
he said : " they are important because they give a picture of how nhs waiting list problems are affecting the already over-burdened gp . "

researchers claim that eight out of ten doctors believe the number of patients paying for operations because of long waiting lists has grown over the last five years .
they also said 40,000 people waiting to be seen as hospital outpatients were admitted as emergency cases in december because their condition deteriorated .
the study of 400 gps , by medix uk plc , says the workload of family practitioners is dominated by patients whose condition is worsening as they wait to see a specialist .
mike stone , director of the patients ' association , told bbc news online the situation would not improve until the nhs " gets its act together by cutting waiting times " .
appointments according to the survey unnecessary appointments involving people waiting for surgery were a serious problem , with gps coping with more than 100,000 such cases in december .
there is no doubt that gps are spending far too much of their valuable time in efforts to get patients onto waiting lists dr rino coladangelo medix said the appointments , affecting nine out of ten doctors , would not have been required if the patients had received the surgery they required .
a similar number had tried to get patients seen at a hospital sooner because their condition worsened in december .
almost 80 % said half of more of their recent referrals to outpatients were asked to wait too long to see a specialist .
the same proportion of gps thought their local hospitals discharged patients too soon after operations to make way for new cases .
a clear majority had treated patients because they had been sent home too early .
no choice mr stone said he was unsurprised by the findings , adding that more and more patients were realising the only way they could get treatment was to pay for it themselves .
he said : " people , quite rightly , are making decisions - rather than perhaps taking a two week holiday , they 're thinking ' well , my health is more important ' .
" we have heard of patients who have had to have their houses remortgaged to get the operation . "
mr stone said many patients , particularly those needing potentially life-saving operations , felt they had no choice but to find the money for private treatment .
' valuable time ' dr rino coladangelo , medix chief executive and himself a family doctor with 20 years experience , said the survey revealed the real experiences of gps and their patients .
he said : " there is no doubt that gps are spending far too much of their valuable time in efforts to get patients onto waiting lists , to expedite appointments and to cope with premature discharge . "
he said : " they are important because they give a picture of how nhs waiting list problems are affecting the already over-burdened gp . "

bangladesh 's textile industry is in crisis after a slump in orders from abroad - especially the us since 11 september - and hundreds of thousands of employees have already lost their jobs .
the bangladesh garment manufacturers and exporters association says that business is also in decline because of increased competition from the rest of asia .
bangladesh is not among the 74 of the world 's least developed countries which are allowed duty and quota free access to the us market for their readymade garments .
the industry is bangladesh 's largest employer , accounting for more than 70 % of overseas exports .
no concrete proposals last year two senior bangladeshi ministers visited washington to plead for more orders and now the us has reciprocated , sending two congressmen to dhaka .
the two congressmen , joseph crowley and james mcdermott , did not announce any concrete measures to help the ailing bangladeshi textile industry .
but they did say they expect investment in bangladesh to increase significantly over the next few years .
mr crowley told a news conference in dhaka that he understands how important the textile industry is to bangladesh .
" it is important to us that we do everything we can in the congress to make in possible for you to continue to expand your textile relationship with the united states and while we are back there we will be working on trying to get a better opportunity for bangladesh in the textile arena , " he said .
" there are many ways to do that and i am not sure how it will happen but i am confident that with the help of the bangladesh american community we can raise enough attention to this issue that it will be possible to make a change . "

the women of the garment industry are crucial to bangladesh 's economic progress .
it is estimated that more than 800,000 women work in garment factories across the country but in the last few months around one eighth have lost their jobs .

more than eight million people have watched almost 9,000 performances of the west end show , which is credited with helping transform musical theatre .
the run will end on 11 may - exactly 21 years after it opened .
the announcement comes just three days after the curtain fell on the west end production of starlight express , one of andrew lloyd webber 's other long-running shows , for the final time .
composed by lloyd webber , cats set verses from ts eliot 's 1939 children 's book old possum 's book of practical cats to music .
cats had been broadway 's longest running show , with 7,485 performances over almost 18 years , until it closed in september 2000 .
when it closed there , lloyd webber addressed the crowd , saying the london production was a " huge , huge risk " when it opened .
" people do n't believe this but we opened with quite a lot of our capital missing .
the only thing i will say is musical theatre has got to continue to take risks . "
the original first night at the new london theatre had to be postponed when actress judi dench suffered a torn achilles tendon and elaine paige took over the part of grizabella .
it finally opened on 11 may 1981 with a cast that included paige , brian blessed , paul nicholas , wayne sleep , sarah brightman and bonnie langford .
paige went on to have a hit single with the song memory , from the show , and the cast won a grammy award .
the original production also won two laurence olivier awards in 1981 .
since then , it has taken £ 136m at london box offices and a further £ 1.25bn worldwide .
global success cats is the second highest grossing musical of all time , after the phantom of the opera .
it has been seen by more than 50 million people in 300 cities across the globe including buenos aires , seoul , helsinki and singapore .
it is currently on a tour of the united states , which will end in july , and is also still playing in japan , germany and hungary .
it was reported last year that lloyd webber was considering transferring cats and other shows to china .
