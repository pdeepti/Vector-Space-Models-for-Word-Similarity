much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the united states as such personalities as french philosopher bernhard-henri levy , the green politician daniel cohn-bendit and german author peter schneider participated in a day-long symposium on the causes and consequences of the september 11 attacks .
besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .
while haider has never made secret his intentions to be austrian chancellor , political analysts say he is reluctant this time around because he fears bad results for the party in this year ’ s elections . haider 's revolt dissolves government his party may not recover from last week 's dispute amongst party members , which haider led against his own party chairwoman and austrian vice chancellor susanne riess-passer .
the dispute was over talks of a possible delay on proposed tax cuts . riess-passer argued that taxes should not be cut until the government finished paying for damages caused by the recent flooding in austria , but haider firmly opposed any delay and rallied party delegates against her .
instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .
he has indicated that he is open to any alliance except with haider 's party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian government collapses , new elections called chancellor wolfgang schuessel said a fight staged by far-right politician joerg haider with members of his own party made it impossible to continue the coalition .
elections could be as soon as november , a year early .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .

the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .

with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .
the list of sponsors is long , ranging from albanian airlines to zapf movers .
but it ’ s clear to all that more than the funds which barely suffice to cover the organisational costs , it ’ s the sheer enthusiasm for literature that will sustain the festival till september 21 .
the 2nd international literature festival runs through sept .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .
while haider has never made secret his intentions to be austrian chancellor , political analysts say he is reluctant this time around because he fears bad results for the party in this year ’ s elections . haider 's revolt dissolves government his party may not recover from last week 's dispute amongst party members , which haider led against his own party chairwoman and austrian vice chancellor susanne riess-passer .
the dispute was over talks of a possible delay on proposed tax cuts . riess-passer argued that taxes should not be cut until the government finished paying for damages caused by the recent flooding in austria , but haider firmly opposed any delay and rallied party delegates against her .
instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.09.2002 world literature around the clock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling on all literary buffs - the opening day berlin is sounding a lot like the tower of babel as the 2nd international literature festival gets underway with more than 100 authors from over 50 countries transforming the german capital into a literary hub . at a movie theatre in the berlin district of kreuzberg last week , a young blond adonis jumped on to the stage before the hollywood flick could begin .
much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the united states as such personalities as french philosopher bernhard-henri levy , the green politician daniel cohn-bendit and german author peter schneider participated in a day-long symposium on the causes and consequences of the september 11 attacks .
besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .
the list of sponsors is long , ranging from albanian airlines to zapf movers .
but it ’ s clear to all that more than the funds which barely suffice to cover the organisational costs , it ’ s the sheer enthusiasm for literature that will sustain the festival till september 21 .
the 2nd international literature festival runs through sept .

" tut , " an acronym that stands for " one thousand environmental taxis for berlin , " may help the government to reach that goal . two years ago , the ministry of the environment signed the tut agreement with the city senate and berlin gas companies that put natural gas-run taxis on the capital ’ s streets .
tut aims to bring the number of green taxis up to a thousand in the next few years .
taxi drivers and driving schools can apply for up to 4,600 euros for a car and for gas . although a car run on natural gas remains rather expensive , the gas is nearly 20 percent cheaper than diesel or gasoline .
it also produces fewer emissions : 25 percent less carbon dioxide and half as much carbon monoxide .
on top of that , the cars are quieter than diesel- or gasoline-run cars . money makes it worthwhile according to elke lohmeyer , the owner of the 100th natural gas taxi in berlin , tut makes it worthwhile to buy a natural gas-run car : “ we get subsidies that we don ’ t have to pay back , and when does somebody gives you money that you don ’ t have to pay back ? " she told dw-radio .
" -lrb- the money is -rrb- both for the car , as well as for natural gas coupons , so that we can practically drive for free for a while . ” in the meantime , 12 gas stations in berlin provide natural gas pumps to tut-participants .
five major car manufacturers produce relatively affordable cars that run either exclusively on natural gas or have an additional gasoline tank .
so why aren ’ t more such cars out on the road ? a spokeswoman from the berlin gas works says there are several problems . “ at the moments the hitches are that gas stations haven ’ t been built in germany , " he said .
" they ’ re planned but not yet there .
and that the german producers aren ’ t taking part as we would like them to .
it costs money to do something new , and people have a hard time with that . ” tut isn ’ t just meant to turn taxi drivers and driving teachers on to more environmentally-friendly vehicles though .
in the long run private people are the focus .
cars funded by tut also function as moving billboards with ads saying that they run on natural gas . elke lohmeyer says the effect ca n't be underestimated . “ a lot of people approach me , and , of course , they notice that the car is new and then they see the ad or sometimes i point it out to them and then we start to talk and people are really interested , ” she said . perhaps it 's working : the berlin gas works have already received 100 applications for private sponsorship of natural gas-run vehicles that are just waiting to be processed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links tut - a thousand environmental taxis for berlin 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" tut , " an acronym that stands for " one thousand environmental taxis for berlin , " may help the government to reach that goal . two years ago , the ministry of the environment signed the tut agreement with the city senate and berlin gas companies that put natural gas-run taxis on the capital ’ s streets .
tut aims to bring the number of green taxis up to a thousand in the next few years .
taxi drivers and driving schools can apply for up to 4,600 euros for a car and for gas . although a car run on natural gas remains rather expensive , the gas is nearly 20 percent cheaper than diesel or gasoline .
it also produces fewer emissions : 25 percent less carbon dioxide and half as much carbon monoxide .
on top of that , the cars are quieter than diesel- or gasoline-run cars . money makes it worthwhile according to elke lohmeyer , the owner of the 100th natural gas taxi in berlin , tut makes it worthwhile to buy a natural gas-run car : “ we get subsidies that we don ’ t have to pay back , and when does somebody gives you money that you don ’ t have to pay back ? " she told dw-radio .
" -lrb- the money is -rrb- both for the car , as well as for natural gas coupons , so that we can practically drive for free for a while . ” in the meantime , 12 gas stations in berlin provide natural gas pumps to tut-participants .
five major car manufacturers produce relatively affordable cars that run either exclusively on natural gas or have an additional gasoline tank .
so why aren ’ t more such cars out on the road ? a spokeswoman from the berlin gas works says there are several problems . “ at the moments the hitches are that gas stations haven ’ t been built in germany , " he said .

and that the german producers aren ’ t taking part as we would like them to .
it costs money to do something new , and people have a hard time with that . ” tut isn ’ t just meant to turn taxi drivers and driving teachers on to more environmentally-friendly vehicles though .

" tut , " an acronym that stands for " one thousand environmental taxis for berlin , " may help the government to reach that goal . two years ago , the ministry of the environment signed the tut agreement with the city senate and berlin gas companies that put natural gas-run taxis on the capital ’ s streets .
tut aims to bring the number of green taxis up to a thousand in the next few years .
taxi drivers and driving schools can apply for up to 4,600 euros for a car and for gas . although a car run on natural gas remains rather expensive , the gas is nearly 20 percent cheaper than diesel or gasoline .
it also produces fewer emissions : 25 percent less carbon dioxide and half as much carbon monoxide .
on top of that , the cars are quieter than diesel- or gasoline-run cars . money makes it worthwhile according to elke lohmeyer , the owner of the 100th natural gas taxi in berlin , tut makes it worthwhile to buy a natural gas-run car : “ we get subsidies that we don ’ t have to pay back , and when does somebody gives you money that you don ’ t have to pay back ? " she told dw-radio .
" -lrb- the money is -rrb- both for the car , as well as for natural gas coupons , so that we can practically drive for free for a while . ” in the meantime , 12 gas stations in berlin provide natural gas pumps to tut-participants .
five major car manufacturers produce relatively affordable cars that run either exclusively on natural gas or have an additional gasoline tank .
so why aren ’ t more such cars out on the road ? a spokeswoman from the berlin gas works says there are several problems . “ at the moments the hitches are that gas stations haven ’ t been built in germany , " he said .

and that the german producers aren ’ t taking part as we would like them to .
it costs money to do something new , and people have a hard time with that . ” tut isn ’ t just meant to turn taxi drivers and driving teachers on to more environmentally-friendly vehicles though .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .
while haider has never made secret his intentions to be austrian chancellor , political analysts say he is reluctant this time around because he fears bad results for the party in this year ’ s elections . haider 's revolt dissolves government his party may not recover from last week 's dispute amongst party members , which haider led against his own party chairwoman and austrian vice chancellor susanne riess-passer .
the dispute was over talks of a possible delay on proposed tax cuts . riess-passer argued that taxes should not be cut until the government finished paying for damages caused by the recent flooding in austria , but haider firmly opposed any delay and rallied party delegates against her .
instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .
he has indicated that he is open to any alliance except with haider 's party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian government collapses , new elections called chancellor wolfgang schuessel said a fight staged by far-right politician joerg haider with members of his own party made it impossible to continue the coalition .
elections could be as soon as november , a year early .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the united states as such personalities as french philosopher bernhard-henri levy , the green politician daniel cohn-bendit and german author peter schneider participated in a day-long symposium on the causes and consequences of the september 11 attacks .
besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .
the list of sponsors is long , ranging from albanian airlines to zapf movers .
but it ’ s clear to all that more than the funds which barely suffice to cover the organisational costs , it ’ s the sheer enthusiasm for literature that will sustain the festival till september 21 .

instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the united states as such personalities as french philosopher bernhard-henri levy , the green politician daniel cohn-bendit and german author peter schneider participated in a day-long symposium on the causes and consequences of the september 11 attacks .
besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .
the list of sponsors is long , ranging from albanian airlines to zapf movers .
but it ’ s clear to all that more than the funds which barely suffice to cover the organisational costs , it ’ s the sheer enthusiasm for literature that will sustain the festival till september 21 .

" tut , " an acronym that stands for " one thousand environmental taxis for berlin , " may help the government to reach that goal . two years ago , the ministry of the environment signed the tut agreement with the city senate and berlin gas companies that put natural gas-run taxis on the capital ’ s streets .
tut aims to bring the number of green taxis up to a thousand in the next few years .
taxi drivers and driving schools can apply for up to 4,600 euros for a car and for gas . although a car run on natural gas remains rather expensive , the gas is nearly 20 percent cheaper than diesel or gasoline .
it also produces fewer emissions : 25 percent less carbon dioxide and half as much carbon monoxide .
on top of that , the cars are quieter than diesel- or gasoline-run cars . money makes it worthwhile according to elke lohmeyer , the owner of the 100th natural gas taxi in berlin , tut makes it worthwhile to buy a natural gas-run car : “ we get subsidies that we don ’ t have to pay back , and when does somebody gives you money that you don ’ t have to pay back ? " she told dw-radio .
" -lrb- the money is -rrb- both for the car , as well as for natural gas coupons , so that we can practically drive for free for a while . ” in the meantime , 12 gas stations in berlin provide natural gas pumps to tut-participants .
five major car manufacturers produce relatively affordable cars that run either exclusively on natural gas or have an additional gasoline tank .
so why aren ’ t more such cars out on the road ? a spokeswoman from the berlin gas works says there are several problems . “ at the moments the hitches are that gas stations haven ’ t been built in germany , " he said .

cars funded by tut also function as moving billboards with ads saying that they run on natural gas . elke lohmeyer says the effect ca n't be underestimated . “ a lot of people approach me , and , of course , they notice that the car is new and then they see the ad or sometimes i point it out to them and then we start to talk and people are really interested , ” she said . perhaps it 's working : the berlin gas works have already received 100 applications for private sponsorship of natural gas-run vehicles that are just waiting to be processed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links tut - a thousand environmental taxis for berlin 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" tut , " an acronym that stands for " one thousand environmental taxis for berlin , " may help the government to reach that goal . two years ago , the ministry of the environment signed the tut agreement with the city senate and berlin gas companies that put natural gas-run taxis on the capital ’ s streets .
tut aims to bring the number of green taxis up to a thousand in the next few years .
taxi drivers and driving schools can apply for up to 4,600 euros for a car and for gas . although a car run on natural gas remains rather expensive , the gas is nearly 20 percent cheaper than diesel or gasoline .
it also produces fewer emissions : 25 percent less carbon dioxide and half as much carbon monoxide .
on top of that , the cars are quieter than diesel- or gasoline-run cars . money makes it worthwhile according to elke lohmeyer , the owner of the 100th natural gas taxi in berlin , tut makes it worthwhile to buy a natural gas-run car : “ we get subsidies that we don ’ t have to pay back , and when does somebody gives you money that you don ’ t have to pay back ? " she told dw-radio .
" -lrb- the money is -rrb- both for the car , as well as for natural gas coupons , so that we can practically drive for free for a while . ” in the meantime , 12 gas stations in berlin provide natural gas pumps to tut-participants .
five major car manufacturers produce relatively affordable cars that run either exclusively on natural gas or have an additional gasoline tank .
so why aren ’ t more such cars out on the road ? a spokeswoman from the berlin gas works says there are several problems . “ at the moments the hitches are that gas stations haven ’ t been built in germany , " he said .

" tut , " an acronym that stands for " one thousand environmental taxis for berlin , " may help the government to reach that goal . two years ago , the ministry of the environment signed the tut agreement with the city senate and berlin gas companies that put natural gas-run taxis on the capital ’ s streets .
tut aims to bring the number of green taxis up to a thousand in the next few years .
taxi drivers and driving schools can apply for up to 4,600 euros for a car and for gas . although a car run on natural gas remains rather expensive , the gas is nearly 20 percent cheaper than diesel or gasoline .
it also produces fewer emissions : 25 percent less carbon dioxide and half as much carbon monoxide .
on top of that , the cars are quieter than diesel- or gasoline-run cars . money makes it worthwhile according to elke lohmeyer , the owner of the 100th natural gas taxi in berlin , tut makes it worthwhile to buy a natural gas-run car : “ we get subsidies that we don ’ t have to pay back , and when does somebody gives you money that you don ’ t have to pay back ? " she told dw-radio .
" -lrb- the money is -rrb- both for the car , as well as for natural gas coupons , so that we can practically drive for free for a while . ” in the meantime , 12 gas stations in berlin provide natural gas pumps to tut-participants .
five major car manufacturers produce relatively affordable cars that run either exclusively on natural gas or have an additional gasoline tank .
so why aren ’ t more such cars out on the road ? a spokeswoman from the berlin gas works says there are several problems . “ at the moments the hitches are that gas stations haven ’ t been built in germany , " he said .
" they ’ re planned but not yet there .
and that the german producers aren ’ t taking part as we would like them to .
it costs money to do something new , and people have a hard time with that . ” tut isn ’ t just meant to turn taxi drivers and driving teachers on to more environmentally-friendly vehicles though .
in the long run private people are the focus .
cars funded by tut also function as moving billboards with ads saying that they run on natural gas . elke lohmeyer says the effect ca n't be underestimated . “ a lot of people approach me , and , of course , they notice that the car is new and then they see the ad or sometimes i point it out to them and then we start to talk and people are really interested , ” she said . perhaps it 's working : the berlin gas works have already received 100 applications for private sponsorship of natural gas-run vehicles that are just waiting to be processed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links tut - a thousand environmental taxis for berlin 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the united states as such personalities as french philosopher bernhard-henri levy , the green politician daniel cohn-bendit and german author peter schneider participated in a day-long symposium on the causes and consequences of the september 11 attacks .
besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .
the list of sponsors is long , ranging from albanian airlines to zapf movers .
but it ’ s clear to all that more than the funds which barely suffice to cover the organisational costs , it ’ s the sheer enthusiasm for literature that will sustain the festival till september 21 .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .
while haider has never made secret his intentions to be austrian chancellor , political analysts say he is reluctant this time around because he fears bad results for the party in this year ’ s elections . haider 's revolt dissolves government his party may not recover from last week 's dispute amongst party members , which haider led against his own party chairwoman and austrian vice chancellor susanne riess-passer .
the dispute was over talks of a possible delay on proposed tax cuts . riess-passer argued that taxes should not be cut until the government finished paying for damages caused by the recent flooding in austria , but haider firmly opposed any delay and rallied party delegates against her .
instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .
he has indicated that he is open to any alliance except with haider 's party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian government collapses , new elections called chancellor wolfgang schuessel said a fight staged by far-right politician joerg haider with members of his own party made it impossible to continue the coalition .
elections could be as soon as november , a year early .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .

but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .
while haider has never made secret his intentions to be austrian chancellor , political analysts say he is reluctant this time around because he fears bad results for the party in this year ’ s elections . haider 's revolt dissolves government his party may not recover from last week 's dispute amongst party members , which haider led against his own party chairwoman and austrian vice chancellor susanne riess-passer .
the dispute was over talks of a possible delay on proposed tax cuts . riess-passer argued that taxes should not be cut until the government finished paying for damages caused by the recent flooding in austria , but haider firmly opposed any delay and rallied party delegates against her .
instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .
he has indicated that he is open to any alliance except with haider 's party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian government collapses , new elections called chancellor wolfgang schuessel said a fight staged by far-right politician joerg haider with members of his own party made it impossible to continue the coalition .
elections could be as soon as november , a year early .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .
while haider has never made secret his intentions to be austrian chancellor , political analysts say he is reluctant this time around because he fears bad results for the party in this year ’ s elections . haider 's revolt dissolves government his party may not recover from last week 's dispute amongst party members , which haider led against his own party chairwoman and austrian vice chancellor susanne riess-passer .
the dispute was over talks of a possible delay on proposed tax cuts . riess-passer argued that taxes should not be cut until the government finished paying for damages caused by the recent flooding in austria , but haider firmly opposed any delay and rallied party delegates against her .
instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .
he has indicated that he is open to any alliance except with haider 's party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian government collapses , new elections called chancellor wolfgang schuessel said a fight staged by far-right politician joerg haider with members of his own party made it impossible to continue the coalition .
elections could be as soon as november , a year early .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the united states as such personalities as french philosopher bernhard-henri levy , the green politician daniel cohn-bendit and german author peter schneider participated in a day-long symposium on the causes and consequences of the september 11 attacks .
besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .
the list of sponsors is long , ranging from albanian airlines to zapf movers .
but it ’ s clear to all that more than the funds which barely suffice to cover the organisational costs , it ’ s the sheer enthusiasm for literature that will sustain the festival till september 21 .
the 2nd international literature festival runs through sept .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .
while haider has never made secret his intentions to be austrian chancellor , political analysts say he is reluctant this time around because he fears bad results for the party in this year ’ s elections . haider 's revolt dissolves government his party may not recover from last week 's dispute amongst party members , which haider led against his own party chairwoman and austrian vice chancellor susanne riess-passer .
the dispute was over talks of a possible delay on proposed tax cuts . riess-passer argued that taxes should not be cut until the government finished paying for damages caused by the recent flooding in austria , but haider firmly opposed any delay and rallied party delegates against her .
instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .
he has indicated that he is open to any alliance except with haider 's party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian government collapses , new elections called chancellor wolfgang schuessel said a fight staged by far-right politician joerg haider with members of his own party made it impossible to continue the coalition .
elections could be as soon as november , a year early .

swiss scientists have revealed just how allergenic the euro coins are to those suffering from nickel allergy , a relatively common syndrome . worried wolfgang , rattling his loose change in his pockets as he waits for the tram ; bored beatrice , absent-mindedly making piles of euros on her desk ; hungry henri , running off to the pastry shop with coins clutched in his sweaty little fists - all are playing a dangerous game .
according to a team of swiss scientists , some of us in the eurozone who spend time handling the single currency are in danger of a nasty shock .
following a study earlier this year by swedish and british scientists into the link between the euro coins and eczema , further information from switzerland links the coins to allergic reactions .
the euro currency , adopted by most of europe at the beginning of this year , can release up to 320 times the amount of nickel that european union regulations say triggers skin reactions in people allergic to the metal .

swiss scientists have revealed just how allergenic the euro coins are to those suffering from nickel allergy , a relatively common syndrome . worried wolfgang , rattling his loose change in his pockets as he waits for the tram ; bored beatrice , absent-mindedly making piles of euros on her desk ; hungry henri , running off to the pastry shop with coins clutched in his sweaty little fists - all are playing a dangerous game .
according to a team of swiss scientists , some of us in the eurozone who spend time handling the single currency are in danger of a nasty shock .
following a study earlier this year by swedish and british scientists into the link between the euro coins and eczema , further information from switzerland links the coins to allergic reactions .
the euro currency , adopted by most of europe at the beginning of this year , can release up to 320 times the amount of nickel that european union regulations say triggers skin reactions in people allergic to the metal .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .

besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.09.2002 far-right austrian leader faces uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's controversial politician joerg haider is poised to win his party 's leadership controversial austrian politician joerg haider has returned to lead his freedom party shortly ahead of new parliamentary elections .
but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .
while haider has never made secret his intentions to be austrian chancellor , political analysts say he is reluctant this time around because he fears bad results for the party in this year ’ s elections . haider 's revolt dissolves government his party may not recover from last week 's dispute amongst party members , which haider led against his own party chairwoman and austrian vice chancellor susanne riess-passer .
the dispute was over talks of a possible delay on proposed tax cuts . riess-passer argued that taxes should not be cut until the government finished paying for damages caused by the recent flooding in austria , but haider firmly opposed any delay and rallied party delegates against her .
instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .
he has indicated that he is open to any alliance except with haider 's party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian government collapses , new elections called chancellor wolfgang schuessel said a fight staged by far-right politician joerg haider with members of his own party made it impossible to continue the coalition .

swiss scientists have revealed just how allergenic the euro coins are to those suffering from nickel allergy , a relatively common syndrome . worried wolfgang , rattling his loose change in his pockets as he waits for the tram ; bored beatrice , absent-mindedly making piles of euros on her desk ; hungry henri , running off to the pastry shop with coins clutched in his sweaty little fists - all are playing a dangerous game .
according to a team of swiss scientists , some of us in the eurozone who spend time handling the single currency are in danger of a nasty shock .
following a study earlier this year by swedish and british scientists into the link between the euro coins and eczema , further information from switzerland links the coins to allergic reactions .
the euro currency , adopted by most of europe at the beginning of this year , can release up to 320 times the amount of nickel that european union regulations say triggers skin reactions in people allergic to the metal .
euro coins in breach of safe nickel regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french newspaper seller sorts out his stock of change in euro coins .
the eu directive states legal limits for the amount of nickel released by items that are normally in prolonged contact with the skin , such as earrings or watches .
it is not routinely used to test coins the results show the highest rates of nickel release ever measured for any coins .
frank nestle of the university of zurich , writing in the science magazine , nature , says he and his colleagues have now worked out why - and it 's not just that the new coins contain too much nickel .
human sweat acts as a conductor , releasing irritant in a sweaty palm , each coin is like a tiny battery , according to nestle 's team .
when sweat gets between the two different alloys of the central pill and outer ring of 1 and 2 euro pieces , metal ions flow between them .
this makes the coins corrode , releasing nickel ions , which can set off itching and redness in up to 30 per cent of the population .
nickel is the most important allergen in the environment because of the frequency with which people come into contact with it .
nickel is common in jewellery , coins and clothing such as jean studs .
the researchers at the university of zurich 's dermatology department conducted tests where both types of coin were taped to the skin of seven volunteers known to suffer nickel allergies .
the volunteers experienced redness of the skin and the formation of vesicles , blisters like those seen in chicken pox .
prolonged exposure results in corrosion of coins discovering the link the reaction between coin and skin , the scientists suspended a one-euro coin in ' artificial human sweat ' .
it turned brown and began to erode .
but findings were not as disastrous as one would first think .
it would only provide an increased danger if the coin was held tightly in a human hand for 36 hours , the duration of the test .
dermatologists have been lobbying the eu for many years to reduce nickel exposure .
but the success gained from the eu nickel directive was not repeated with the euro coins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder takes no risks and keeps his euro coins in quarantine .
lower-value euro coins are made of nickel-free alloys .
many countries wanted all the new euro coins to be nickel free .
" there are advantages to putting nickel into coins , " explains nestle 's colleague hannes speidel in the nature article .
nickel is magnetic , which helps vending machines to identify the coins .
using two alloys also makes the 1 and 2 euro coins harder to counterfeit .
even for people with nickel allergies , the coins will not pose huge health risks .
the most common reaction is red , sore skin , a mild annoyance for those , like shopkeepers and bank clerks , who handle lots of money . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro coins could curb the itch to spend according to a recent study by a swedish dermatologist and british laboratory scientist , two of the eight euro coins , due to come into circulation in january 2002 , can cause eczema .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.09.2002 world literature around the clock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling on all literary buffs - the opening day berlin is sounding a lot like the tower of babel as the 2nd international literature festival gets underway with more than 100 authors from over 50 countries transforming the german capital into a literary hub . at a movie theatre in the berlin district of kreuzberg last week , a young blond adonis jumped on to the stage before the hollywood flick could begin .
much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the united states as such personalities as french philosopher bernhard-henri levy , the green politician daniel cohn-bendit and german author peter schneider participated in a day-long symposium on the causes and consequences of the september 11 attacks .
besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .
the list of sponsors is long , ranging from albanian airlines to zapf movers .
but it ’ s clear to all that more than the funds which barely suffice to cover the organisational costs , it ’ s the sheer enthusiasm for literature that will sustain the festival till september 21 .
the 2nd international literature festival runs through sept .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .
while haider has never made secret his intentions to be austrian chancellor , political analysts say he is reluctant this time around because he fears bad results for the party in this year ’ s elections . haider 's revolt dissolves government his party may not recover from last week 's dispute amongst party members , which haider led against his own party chairwoman and austrian vice chancellor susanne riess-passer .
the dispute was over talks of a possible delay on proposed tax cuts . riess-passer argued that taxes should not be cut until the government finished paying for damages caused by the recent flooding in austria , but haider firmly opposed any delay and rallied party delegates against her .
instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .
he has indicated that he is open to any alliance except with haider 's party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian government collapses , new elections called chancellor wolfgang schuessel said a fight staged by far-right politician joerg haider with members of his own party made it impossible to continue the coalition .

instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.09.2002 world literature around the clock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling on all literary buffs - the opening day berlin is sounding a lot like the tower of babel as the 2nd international literature festival gets underway with more than 100 authors from over 50 countries transforming the german capital into a literary hub . at a movie theatre in the berlin district of kreuzberg last week , a young blond adonis jumped on to the stage before the hollywood flick could begin .
much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the united states as such personalities as french philosopher bernhard-henri levy , the green politician daniel cohn-bendit and german author peter schneider participated in a day-long symposium on the causes and consequences of the september 11 attacks .
besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .
the list of sponsors is long , ranging from albanian airlines to zapf movers .
but it ’ s clear to all that more than the funds which barely suffice to cover the organisational costs , it ’ s the sheer enthusiasm for literature that will sustain the festival till september 21 .
the 2nd international literature festival runs through sept .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the united states as such personalities as french philosopher bernhard-henri levy , the green politician daniel cohn-bendit and german author peter schneider participated in a day-long symposium on the causes and consequences of the september 11 attacks .
besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .
the list of sponsors is long , ranging from albanian airlines to zapf movers .
but it ’ s clear to all that more than the funds which barely suffice to cover the organisational costs , it ’ s the sheer enthusiasm for literature that will sustain the festival till september 21 .

but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago . only three days after early elections were announced in austria , controversial politician joerg haider is poised to resume the leadership role in the far-right freedom party he abandoned two years ago .
but polls say an election victory for his party seems unlikely . haider was a key factor in the government collapse last week when he instigated a party revolt over tax policies that led chancellor wolfgang schuessel to declare the freedom party unfit coalition partners .
schuessel immediately called for early elections , abandoning the conservative coalition between the freedom party and the center-right people 's party . november 24th is widely expected to be the new date and austrian politicians are paying close attention to this month ’ s parliamentary elections in germany as an indicator for their own elections . polls indicate that austria is now likely to follow in germany ’ s footsteps and elect a government made up of a coalition between social democrats and the green party .
strategists on both sides said they will be looking for lessons out of the results of germany 's federal elections on sept .
22 . haider to win party leadership freedom party delegates unanimously nominated haider as party chairman on wednesday , at a meeting of the party ’ s executive committee in linz . “ there is no realistic alternative to haider , ” party general secretary karl schweitzer said . haider was the charismatic figurehead that largely contributed to his party ’ s success in the elections in 1999 in which they came in second place .
while he gained popularity in austria , he tarnished his country ’ s image abroad . hours after chancellor schuessel announced a coalition government with haider ’ s freedom party two years ago , the european union imposed diplomatic sanctions on austria .
the eu ’ s diplomatic and political isolation of austria was most likely aimed at haider himself , who has made a number of controversial statements that many in the world community saw as anti-semitic and xenophobic . in 1995 , he referred to the world war ii concentration camps as “ punishment camps ” and said that the nazi ss “ deserves all the honor and respect of the army in public life . ”
his statements against immigrants in austria and the european union have also caused alarm amongst international observers . haider is expected to be voted chairman at the september 21 party convention but not chancellor candidate .
that honor will most likely fall to current social affairs minister herbert haupt .
while haider has never made secret his intentions to be austrian chancellor , political analysts say he is reluctant this time around because he fears bad results for the party in this year ’ s elections . haider 's revolt dissolves government his party may not recover from last week 's dispute amongst party members , which haider led against his own party chairwoman and austrian vice chancellor susanne riess-passer .
the dispute was over talks of a possible delay on proposed tax cuts . riess-passer argued that taxes should not be cut until the government finished paying for damages caused by the recent flooding in austria , but haider firmly opposed any delay and rallied party delegates against her .
instead of bowing to his pressure , she and others resigned , triggering a government collapse . riess-passer was actually haider ’ s personal choice to replace him when he stepped down from the party leadership in may 2000 . but haider had shown increasing dissatisfaction with her performance and the tax-cut dispute was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back . controversial politics as haider looks set to grasp the reins of national political power again , his agenda seems very much the same as before . “ the freedom party under haider will once again be what it was in 1999 and earlier elections , a platform for protest voters , ” fritz plasser of austria ’ s center for political research told reuters . “ it will be an all-around attack against everything , especially the polarizing issue of the effects of eu expansion on austria , ” he said . haider will likely repeat his calls to block eu expansion in eastern and central europe .
he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .
he has indicated that he is open to any alliance except with haider 's party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian government collapses , new elections called chancellor wolfgang schuessel said a fight staged by far-right politician joerg haider with members of his own party made it impossible to continue the coalition .
elections could be as soon as november , a year early .

he has traditionally played up austrian fears of job losses to immigrants from hungary , the czech republic and slovakia . earlier this year , he called on the austrian government to block the czech republic 's entry to the eu if they did not shut down a nuclear power plant near the austrian border . the social democrats , who are leading in the polls have a very different campaign strategy . “ our priorities are health care , social security , pensions , job creation and eu enlargement , ” social democrat leader alfred gusenbauer said at his first campaign news conference . current polls spell bad news haider ’ s concerns over his party 's chances seem justified . recent polls indicate that the freedom party has only around 17 percent of the vote , with analysts putting the real number at closer to 15 .
in 1999 , the party 's anti-immigrant , anti-european platform gave them 27 percent of the vote . the social democrats , who ruled the country for 30 years before losing power in 1999 , are polled at 37 percent and are likely to form a coalition government with the greens who are currently polling at around 14 percent . meanwhile , schuessel and his people ’ s party are focusing on diverting blame for the government ’ s collapse from themselves .
but schuessel still has high hopes . “ the election goal of the people ’ s party is to remain the chancellor party , ” schuessel said , confirming that he will remain the party ’ s top candidate .
although he has indicated a wish to continue his coalition with the freedom party , their weak showings in the polls hint that he would have to look at other options . but haider is not on social democrat gusenbauer ’ s list of coalition partners .
he has indicated that he is open to any alliance except with haider 's party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian government collapses , new elections called chancellor wolfgang schuessel said a fight staged by far-right politician joerg haider with members of his own party made it impossible to continue the coalition .
elections could be as soon as november , a year early .

much to the audience ’ s surprise , he dragged a microphone with him , whipped out a piece of paper and began reading a poem by a famous italian poet .
after five soul-wrenching minutes , the german hunk mouthed a thank you and disappeared .
the stunned audience was then treated to a quick flash on the screen with the words , " 2nd international literature festival " .
too much , too fast ?
innovation is definitely what this year ’ s festival is about .
and maybe a bit of over-ambition too .
for there is no way the die-hard literary buff is going to be able to take in over 200 events at various venues crammed in the space of ten days .
besides book readings , a host of artistic and musical happenings taking place on the sidelines of the festival in berlin ’ s central scheunenviertel district invite visitors to discover the historic area .
under the title , " poetry in the scheunenviertel " , verse and literature will be held in public spaces in co-operation with local cafés , restaurants , galleries , universities , publishing houses and theatres .
to the clink of wine glasses and exquisite appetizers , films , discussions , lectures , performances , exhibitions , parties and historic city tours will form part of the agenda .
there is just so much to do , see and hear as the city pulsates to literature round the clock .
are we in babylonia ?
the festival 's 400-page catalogue is a virtual language almanac where a plethora of foreign names and tongues meet the eye .
the over 100 authors from more than 50 countries who have descended on the city include the nobel prize nominee breyten breytenbach from south africa , the italian best-selling author alessandro baricco , asia djebar from algeria , chilean antonio skarmeta , the acclaimed u.r. anathamurthy from india , edwar al-kharrat from egypt and brazilian children ’ s books author anna maria machado .
but apart from the famous names , this year ’ s international jury has also selected authors and poets who are relatively unknown in germany and europe , and offered them a chance to introduce their works .
in keeping with the multicultural tone of the festival , the german entries include croation-born zoran drvenkar , sherko fatah , a writer of kurdish-german origin , and henryk m. broder , who was born in katowice and is one of germany ’ s most famous essayist .
remembering sept .
11 at the official opening ceremony at the berliner ensemble on tuesday , the director and initiator of the festival , ulrich schreiber said that globalisation should be used to broaden horizons , enrich experiences and to enjoy different cultures .
bosnian author dzevad karahasan held the opening lecture titled " literature as defence of our history " .
he emphasised that everything depends upon " whether we can save our culture from its fundamentalist ‘ herders ’ and whether we ’ ll have enough good literature " .
the festival took on a meaningful note on the first anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the united states as such personalities as french philosopher bernhard-henri levy , the green politician daniel cohn-bendit and german author peter schneider participated in a day-long symposium on the causes and consequences of the september 11 attacks .
besides sept .
11 , authors and intellectuals also tackled other weighty issues as anti-semitism , the middle east conflict and islam .
passion for literature 's enough getting the ambitious festival on its feet was no easy feat .
with coffers in the city-state of berlin facing a major cash-crunch , the festival , which is under the aegis of the german unesco commission , had to look elsewhere for the main bulk of financing .
the list of sponsors is long , ranging from albanian airlines to zapf movers .
but it ’ s clear to all that more than the funds which barely suffice to cover the organisational costs , it ’ s the sheer enthusiasm for literature that will sustain the festival till september 21 .

with almost 60 catwalk shows and presentations due to take place over the next five days , organisers have never put on a bigger display .
among the big names preparing to unveil their new collections are paul smith , john rocha , ben de lisi and frost french .
but many others , including alexander mcqueen , stella mccartney and matthew williamson will all be missing , leaving critics to ask whether london is still as fashionable as it would like to think it is .
supermodels venues lined up for the event include theatres , lord 's cricket ground , billingsgate fish market , a swimming pool , railway arches , and a car park .
many supermodels are expected to stay away a london designers exhibition will take place alongside the main event , selling ready-to-wear clothes and accessories to fashion lovers .
but with big names in short supply among a plethora of smaller designers , it has been suggested that good venues will not be enough to make the event a success .
and it is not just the big designers who are looking elsewhere , as many supermodels are expected to concentrate on preparing for next week 's new york shows instead .
new talent commenting on the lack of big names matthew williamson said : " there is a pattern to british fashion .
when a designer gets to a certain level of success , he or she moves their show out of london .
people love coming to london because there is an element of surprise nicholas coleridge " all my peers like stella mccartney , mcqueen , hussein chalayan , anyone who reaches a certain level does actually leave . "
williamson , whose customers include gwyneth paltrow and kate moss , said many are bought out by bigger companies , while other designers move on to find greater success .
ben de lisi , whose customers include kate winslet , said the british fashion council had a worrying habit of pushing forward new talent with no experience of running a business .
he said : " these young designers are straight out of school and can barely price clothes let along manufacture a line .
" they ca n't deliver on time , there are problems with quality and that ends up reflecting on the whole industry . "
' surprise ' nicholas coleridge , chairman of the british fashion council , denied there was any danger that london fashion week was on the way out .
he said : " people love coming to london because there is an element of surprise .
" other fashion centres might have more commercial muscle but london is very good at finding new talent . "
there are two london fashion weeks in a year , the first of which was in february to show the 2002 autumn and winter collections .

professor sir alec jeffreys said the practice was highly discriminatory and measures should be taken to safeguard against particular individuals or groups being targeted .
and he called for the creation of a national database , storing the profiles of the entire uk population , which would be managed by an independent body .
" if we 're all on the database , we 're all in exactly the same boat - the issue of discrimination disappears , " he said .
the scientist made his comments at the british association 's science festival in leicester .
radical solution professor jeffreys discovered the dna fingerprinting technique by accident 18 years ago .
it has revolutionised crime-fighting , but he now believes that the practice of storing the genetic profiles of suspects who have not been found guilty of a crime is a step too far .
his radical solution is a national dna database from the entire population held by a specially created body .
and he says it would only ever record those parts of a dna profile that identify an individual , not the parts providing information about someone 's appearance , or their susceptibility to disease .
it is likely that in the future the possibility of gleaning such information from dna will increase .
' arguable proposition ' professor jeffreys told the bbc : " with the current dna database of criminals , there 's been a recent extension to include suspects who 've been convicted of no crime at all - i think on the assumption that at some stage in the future these people may commit a criminal offence .
" in my view that is discriminatory .
" my other concern is that some forensic scientists are now beginning to look for physical characteristics ; genetic determinates of hair and eye colour , ethnic group as well - to get some indication of the physical appearance of a person where you have no clear suspect .
" the use of this sort of very private genetic information by the police does fill me with very considerable concern . "
three million target more than 1.5 million dna profiles are now held on the £ 187m national dna database -lrb- ndnad -rrb- and the target is to have about three million profiles stored by april 2004 .
home office figures show that every week about 1,600 dna matches are made either connecting a suspect to a crime scene or linking crime scenes together .
police see the resource as a valuable asset in the fight against crime .
but critics , including human rights group liberty , have criticised the " appalling " practice of keeping samples from people who have not been convicted .
and some scientists have warned that as the database grows the chances of two very similar profiles from two different people emerging increases .
great value the ndnad is run by the forensic science service -lrb- fss -rrb- .
it stressed on thursday that the profiles held on file are not used for any purpose other than the investigation of crime and do not contain information about a person 's appearance or health .
custodian of the database dr bob bramley said : " we are loading more and more profiles from individuals on to the national dna database and its value is increasing accordingly .
" it is now recognised by the police as one of their most powerful intelligence tools . "
a spokesperson from the fss added that the chance of finding two full dna profiles which appear the same but are not actually from the same person is possible , but very slim .
" but we are very aware of this ; it is not something we have not considered , " he told the bbc .

the news of 88,500 new positions put to rest fears sparked partly by july 's unexpected fall in employment , that the country 's recent surging economic performance was at risk .
the gain was almost three times as much as economists had been expecting , and was largely based on new hiring by builders and retailers capitalising on continued strength in consumer spending .
but rising numbers of people encouraged to seek work by the robust economy meant the jump did not lead to any cut in the headline unemployment rate .
one outcome is likely to be a rise in interest rates before the end of the year , analysts said , despite the persistent weakness in the global picture .
good times a rash of poor figures in recent months had suggested that the good times - fuelled by a housing boom - might be coming to an end .
retail trade has suffered its first fall in nine months , while growth in national output for the april-june quarter fell short of expectations .
but in the past week , new data has suggested that things may still be in reasonably good shape .
both business and consumer confidence are holding up well in comparison to other developed countries .
" i think -lrb- the employment data -rrb- shows that the domestic economy here continues to remain pretty firm , " said john horner , senior strategist at sg australia .
" we 've had a strong domestic economy in the second quarter , with a little slowing in july depicted in retail sales , but nothing to get too concerned about . "

the air support group is designed to provide 24-hour support to officers on the ground .
councillor carol gustafson , chair of merseyside police authority , said the helicopter was a " real boost " .
