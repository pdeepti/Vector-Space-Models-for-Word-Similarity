but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .
that is less prodi 's problem than that of the german and portuguese finance ministers .

but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .

but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "
caught between a rock and a hard place germany now finds itself in a double bind .
most experts agree that , faced with a slowing economy , the government would normally lower interest rates to try and fire it up again .
but interest rates across the euro-zone are set by the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , which is against any reduction , so this is an option that eichel no longer has .
his only other course of action is to use fiscal policy to support the economy , which is to a large extent ruled out by the stability pact 's three percent limit .
meeting in paris earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder and the french president , jacques chirac , agreed that the pact should be interpreted in a flexible way in view of the current international situation .
ecb president wim duisenberg has already rejected any relaxation of the three-percent rule .
germany ’ s conservatives cry foul germany ’ s conservative opposition says the deficit violation proves that the government deceived voters in the run-up to last month ’ s election .
the christian democrats ’ leader angela merkel called it " an outrage beyond description .
" even though the social democrats and their green allies have known this for a long time , " she said , " their forecasts were wrong .
this goes to show that schröder simply lied to the voters in the election . "

but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "

under new eu rules , german makers of the sheep and goat ’ s milk product can no longer call their cheese ‘ feta ’ .
that right is now solely held by greece .
the new regulations , agreed upon by the european commission on monday , state that only feta produced in certain parts of greece and according to traditional practices will be allowed to market itself as feta , despite the fact that the same cheese has been produced legally in germany since 1985 .
cheese twist it ’ s the latest twist in a european cheese-naming debacle and not the first time the eu has attempted to protect greek feta producers .
in 1996 , the european union awarded greece the sole right to market their product as ‘ feta ’ .
however three years later , the european court of justice overturned this ruling , after angry french , german and danish makers of the cheese brought a case against the ruling .
now , the new regulations effectively return things back to the way they were .
the real big cheese authentic greek feta is made solely from sheep or from a specific ratio of sheep and goat ’ s milk .
according to rules detailed in the greek food and beverages code , the cheese must mature for over two months in chambers where the temperature and humidity is strictly controlled .
authentic feta must also be free of preservatives and antibiotic substances .
these guidelines on correct feta production predate by far any eu decisions on the matter : archeologists have found evidence that the greeks were making correctly named feta as early as the time of homer ’ s " odyssey " .
fighting back but german and danish producers of the cheese are not ready to give up yet .
hans bender of the danish dairy board told dw-world : " we ’ ve been expecting these new rules for quite some time so we ’ re not really surprised .
we ’ ve been preparing for it . "
bender , who brought the initial 1996 case against the eu , called the new regulations " a nasty piece of mismanagement on the part of the european commission . "
" feta cheese has been produced in denmark since the 1930 ’ s and legally in germany since 1985 .
we ’ ve exported it to many countries , including greece and never received any complaints , " bender told dw-world .
erberhard hetzler , a spokesperson for the german dairy association agreed .
" in terms of taste , there is hardly any difference between feta cheese produced in greece and that produced in germany or denmark . "
" we will take every possible legal step to overturn this , " hetzler said work has already begun on a new case which germany , denmark and possibly also france , will bring before the european court of justice in december .
the end for german feta ?
but whatever the outcome of the case , as the rules stand now , all is not lost for german feta .
although the new rules came into force on monday , producers outside of greece have five years in which to lay down their cheese-making paddles or begin to market their product under a different name .

under new eu rules , german makers of the sheep and goat ’ s milk product can no longer call their cheese ‘ feta ’ .
that right is now solely held by greece .

cheese twist it ’ s the latest twist in a european cheese-naming debacle and not the first time the eu has attempted to protect greek feta producers .
in 1996 , the european union awarded greece the sole right to market their product as ‘ feta ’ .

the real big cheese authentic greek feta is made solely from sheep or from a specific ratio of sheep and goat ’ s milk .
according to rules detailed in the greek food and beverages code , the cheese must mature for over two months in chambers where the temperature and humidity is strictly controlled .
authentic feta must also be free of preservatives and antibiotic substances .

bender , who brought the initial 1996 case against the eu , called the new regulations " a nasty piece of mismanagement on the part of the european commission . "
" feta cheese has been produced in denmark since the 1930 ’ s and legally in germany since 1985 .
we ’ ve exported it to many countries , including greece and never received any complaints , " bender told dw-world .
erberhard hetzler , a spokesperson for the german dairy association agreed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal " mcberti " takes on his former team german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes german players pessimistic ahead of italy clash culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.10.2002 germany beats faroe islands by a hair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the next soccer power an archipelago in the north sea ?
although germany ’ s team beat the northern islanders in a european soccer qualification round , the real praise goes to the plucky underdogs who played a respectable game against the runner-up world champions . the faroe islands may be one of the minnows of european soccer , but the island team from the north sea gave the germans a good run in a qualification game on wednesday night in hanover .
despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .
we were strong on the defense , and we attempted a lot on the offense .
we also had a few shots at the goal , but we still have to train a lot more . ”
germany ’ s coach rudi völler admitted the game had brought his team down to earth from its lofty expectations : “ it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . ”
an underestimated force the tiny group of 18 islands located off the northern coast of scotland , between norway and iceland in the icy north sea , is certainly not the place one normally thinks about for hosting a soccer nation .
but , the faroe islands are not to be underestimated .
although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , the islanders can ’ t be topped in their enthusiasm for the sport .
nearly one in every eight residents is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
the genuine love for the game and the emotional support from the fans is the faroese strongest weapon when it comes to challenging other bigger teams .
scotland already experienced what it means to go up against the underdogs after just barely snatching a lucky 2:2 draw in september .
scotland ’ s german coach berti vogts warned his compatriot völler not to underestimate the potential of the faroes : his team of highly-paid players is still nursing its bruises from the embarrassment .
völler himself seems to have taken the words to heart .
at the start of wednesday ’ s match , the german coach stressed that today their were no easy opponents in soccer .
“ one shouldn ’ t make light of our challengers from the faroe islands , ” he reportedly told his players .
and at the end of the game , the germans certainly weren ’ t laughing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links facts about the faroe islands 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

although germany ’ s team beat the northern islanders in a european soccer qualification round , the real praise goes to the plucky underdogs who played a respectable game against the runner-up world champions . the faroe islands may be one of the minnows of european soccer , but the island team from the north sea gave the germans a good run in a qualification game on wednesday night in hanover .
despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .
we were strong on the defense , and we attempted a lot on the offense .
we also had a few shots at the goal , but we still have to train a lot more . ”
germany ’ s coach rudi völler admitted the game had brought his team down to earth from its lofty expectations : “ it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . ”
an underestimated force the tiny group of 18 islands located off the northern coast of scotland , between norway and iceland in the icy north sea , is certainly not the place one normally thinks about for hosting a soccer nation .
but , the faroe islands are not to be underestimated .
although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , the islanders can ’ t be topped in their enthusiasm for the sport .
nearly one in every eight residents is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
the genuine love for the game and the emotional support from the fans is the faroese strongest weapon when it comes to challenging other bigger teams .
scotland already experienced what it means to go up against the underdogs after just barely snatching a lucky 2:2 draw in september .
scotland ’ s german coach berti vogts warned his compatriot völler not to underestimate the potential of the faroes : his team of highly-paid players is still nursing its bruises from the embarrassment .
völler himself seems to have taken the words to heart .
at the start of wednesday ’ s match , the german coach stressed that today their were no easy opponents in soccer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.10.2002 eu supremo undermines key deficit rule großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commission president romano prodi european commission president romano prodi said on thursday he recognised the eu ’ s stability and growth pact was too rigid .
but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .
that is less prodi 's problem than that of the german and portuguese finance ministers .
it ’ s they who now have to explain to their long-suffering citizens that they are imposing austerity measures in compliance with eu regulations which the highest official in brussels officially describes as " stupid " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .

although germany ’ s team beat the northern islanders in a european soccer qualification round , the real praise goes to the plucky underdogs who played a respectable game against the runner-up world champions . the faroe islands may be one of the minnows of european soccer , but the island team from the north sea gave the germans a good run in a qualification game on wednesday night in hanover .
despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .
we were strong on the defense , and we attempted a lot on the offense .
we also had a few shots at the goal , but we still have to train a lot more . ”
germany ’ s coach rudi völler admitted the game had brought his team down to earth from its lofty expectations : “ it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . ”
an underestimated force the tiny group of 18 islands located off the northern coast of scotland , between norway and iceland in the icy north sea , is certainly not the place one normally thinks about for hosting a soccer nation .
but , the faroe islands are not to be underestimated .
although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , the islanders can ’ t be topped in their enthusiasm for the sport .
nearly one in every eight residents is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
the genuine love for the game and the emotional support from the fans is the faroese strongest weapon when it comes to challenging other bigger teams .
scotland already experienced what it means to go up against the underdogs after just barely snatching a lucky 2:2 draw in september .
scotland ’ s german coach berti vogts warned his compatriot völler not to underestimate the potential of the faroes : his team of highly-paid players is still nursing its bruises from the embarrassment .
völler himself seems to have taken the words to heart .
at the start of wednesday ’ s match , the german coach stressed that today their were no easy opponents in soccer .
“ one shouldn ’ t make light of our challengers from the faroe islands , ” he reportedly told his players .
and at the end of the game , the germans certainly weren ’ t laughing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links facts about the faroe islands 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

under new eu rules , german makers of the sheep and goat ’ s milk product can no longer call their cheese ‘ feta ’ .
that right is now solely held by greece .
the new regulations , agreed upon by the european commission on monday , state that only feta produced in certain parts of greece and according to traditional practices will be allowed to market itself as feta , despite the fact that the same cheese has been produced legally in germany since 1985 .
cheese twist it ’ s the latest twist in a european cheese-naming debacle and not the first time the eu has attempted to protect greek feta producers .
in 1996 , the european union awarded greece the sole right to market their product as ‘ feta ’ .
however three years later , the european court of justice overturned this ruling , after angry french , german and danish makers of the cheese brought a case against the ruling .
now , the new regulations effectively return things back to the way they were .
the real big cheese authentic greek feta is made solely from sheep or from a specific ratio of sheep and goat ’ s milk .
according to rules detailed in the greek food and beverages code , the cheese must mature for over two months in chambers where the temperature and humidity is strictly controlled .
authentic feta must also be free of preservatives and antibiotic substances .
these guidelines on correct feta production predate by far any eu decisions on the matter : archeologists have found evidence that the greeks were making correctly named feta as early as the time of homer ’ s " odyssey " .
fighting back but german and danish producers of the cheese are not ready to give up yet .
hans bender of the danish dairy board told dw-world : " we ’ ve been expecting these new rules for quite some time so we ’ re not really surprised .
we ’ ve been preparing for it . "
bender , who brought the initial 1996 case against the eu , called the new regulations " a nasty piece of mismanagement on the part of the european commission . "
" feta cheese has been produced in denmark since the 1930 ’ s and legally in germany since 1985 .
we ’ ve exported it to many countries , including greece and never received any complaints , " bender told dw-world .
erberhard hetzler , a spokesperson for the german dairy association agreed .
" in terms of taste , there is hardly any difference between feta cheese produced in greece and that produced in germany or denmark . "
" we will take every possible legal step to overturn this , " hetzler said work has already begun on a new case which germany , denmark and possibly also france , will bring before the european court of justice in december .
the end for german feta ?
but whatever the outcome of the case , as the rules stand now , all is not lost for german feta .
although the new rules came into force on monday , producers outside of greece have five years in which to lay down their cheese-making paddles or begin to market their product under a different name .

under new eu rules , german makers of the sheep and goat ’ s milk product can no longer call their cheese ‘ feta ’ .
that right is now solely held by greece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.10.2002 eu supremo undermines key deficit rule großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commission president romano prodi european commission president romano prodi said on thursday he recognised the eu ’ s stability and growth pact was too rigid .
but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .
that is less prodi 's problem than that of the german and portuguese finance ministers .
it ’ s they who now have to explain to their long-suffering citizens that they are imposing austerity measures in compliance with eu regulations which the highest official in brussels officially describes as " stupid " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .

but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "
caught between a rock and a hard place germany now finds itself in a double bind .
most experts agree that , faced with a slowing economy , the government would normally lower interest rates to try and fire it up again .
but interest rates across the euro-zone are set by the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , which is against any reduction , so this is an option that eichel no longer has .
his only other course of action is to use fiscal policy to support the economy , which is to a large extent ruled out by the stability pact 's three percent limit .
meeting in paris earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder and the french president , jacques chirac , agreed that the pact should be interpreted in a flexible way in view of the current international situation .
ecb president wim duisenberg has already rejected any relaxation of the three-percent rule .
germany ’ s conservatives cry foul germany ’ s conservative opposition says the deficit violation proves that the government deceived voters in the run-up to last month ’ s election .
the christian democrats ’ leader angela merkel called it " an outrage beyond description .
" even though the social democrats and their green allies have known this for a long time , " she said , " their forecasts were wrong .
this goes to show that schröder simply lied to the voters in the election . "

but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .

but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.10.2002 brussels waves big stick over german deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister eichel says germany ca n't make deficit limit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "
caught between a rock and a hard place germany now finds itself in a double bind .
most experts agree that , faced with a slowing economy , the government would normally lower interest rates to try and fire it up again .
but interest rates across the euro-zone are set by the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , which is against any reduction , so this is an option that eichel no longer has .
his only other course of action is to use fiscal policy to support the economy , which is to a large extent ruled out by the stability pact 's three percent limit .
meeting in paris earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder and the french president , jacques chirac , agreed that the pact should be interpreted in a flexible way in view of the current international situation .
ecb president wim duisenberg has already rejected any relaxation of the three-percent rule .
germany ’ s conservatives cry foul germany ’ s conservative opposition says the deficit violation proves that the government deceived voters in the run-up to last month ’ s election .
the christian democrats ’ leader angela merkel called it " an outrage beyond description .
" even though the social democrats and their green allies have known this for a long time , " she said , " their forecasts were wrong .
this goes to show that schröder simply lied to the voters in the election . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.10.2002 brussels waves big stick over german deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister eichel says germany ca n't make deficit limit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "
caught between a rock and a hard place germany now finds itself in a double bind .
most experts agree that , faced with a slowing economy , the government would normally lower interest rates to try and fire it up again .
but interest rates across the euro-zone are set by the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , which is against any reduction , so this is an option that eichel no longer has .
his only other course of action is to use fiscal policy to support the economy , which is to a large extent ruled out by the stability pact 's three percent limit .
meeting in paris earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder and the french president , jacques chirac , agreed that the pact should be interpreted in a flexible way in view of the current international situation .
ecb president wim duisenberg has already rejected any relaxation of the three-percent rule .
germany ’ s conservatives cry foul germany ’ s conservative opposition says the deficit violation proves that the government deceived voters in the run-up to last month ’ s election .
the christian democrats ’ leader angela merkel called it " an outrage beyond description .
" even though the social democrats and their green allies have known this for a long time , " she said , " their forecasts were wrong .
this goes to show that schröder simply lied to the voters in the election . "

under new eu rules , german makers of the sheep and goat ’ s milk product can no longer call their cheese ‘ feta ’ .
that right is now solely held by greece .

the real big cheese authentic greek feta is made solely from sheep or from a specific ratio of sheep and goat ’ s milk .
according to rules detailed in the greek food and beverages code , the cheese must mature for over two months in chambers where the temperature and humidity is strictly controlled .

bender , who brought the initial 1996 case against the eu , called the new regulations " a nasty piece of mismanagement on the part of the european commission . "
" feta cheese has been produced in denmark since the 1930 ’ s and legally in germany since 1985 .
we ’ ve exported it to many countries , including greece and never received any complaints , " bender told dw-world .
erberhard hetzler , a spokesperson for the german dairy association agreed .

under new eu rules , german makers of the sheep and goat ’ s milk product can no longer call their cheese ‘ feta ’ .
that right is now solely held by greece .
the new regulations , agreed upon by the european commission on monday , state that only feta produced in certain parts of greece and according to traditional practices will be allowed to market itself as feta , despite the fact that the same cheese has been produced legally in germany since 1985 .
cheese twist it ’ s the latest twist in a european cheese-naming debacle and not the first time the eu has attempted to protect greek feta producers .
in 1996 , the european union awarded greece the sole right to market their product as ‘ feta ’ .
however three years later , the european court of justice overturned this ruling , after angry french , german and danish makers of the cheese brought a case against the ruling .
now , the new regulations effectively return things back to the way they were .
the real big cheese authentic greek feta is made solely from sheep or from a specific ratio of sheep and goat ’ s milk .
according to rules detailed in the greek food and beverages code , the cheese must mature for over two months in chambers where the temperature and humidity is strictly controlled .
authentic feta must also be free of preservatives and antibiotic substances .
these guidelines on correct feta production predate by far any eu decisions on the matter : archeologists have found evidence that the greeks were making correctly named feta as early as the time of homer ’ s " odyssey " .
fighting back but german and danish producers of the cheese are not ready to give up yet .
hans bender of the danish dairy board told dw-world : " we ’ ve been expecting these new rules for quite some time so we ’ re not really surprised .
we ’ ve been preparing for it . "
bender , who brought the initial 1996 case against the eu , called the new regulations " a nasty piece of mismanagement on the part of the european commission . "
" feta cheese has been produced in denmark since the 1930 ’ s and legally in germany since 1985 .
we ’ ve exported it to many countries , including greece and never received any complaints , " bender told dw-world .

although germany ’ s team beat the northern islanders in a european soccer qualification round , the real praise goes to the plucky underdogs who played a respectable game against the runner-up world champions . the faroe islands may be one of the minnows of european soccer , but the island team from the north sea gave the germans a good run in a qualification game on wednesday night in hanover .
despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .
we were strong on the defense , and we attempted a lot on the offense .
we also had a few shots at the goal , but we still have to train a lot more . ”
germany ’ s coach rudi völler admitted the game had brought his team down to earth from its lofty expectations : “ it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . ”
an underestimated force the tiny group of 18 islands located off the northern coast of scotland , between norway and iceland in the icy north sea , is certainly not the place one normally thinks about for hosting a soccer nation .
but , the faroe islands are not to be underestimated .
although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , the islanders can ’ t be topped in their enthusiasm for the sport .
nearly one in every eight residents is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
the genuine love for the game and the emotional support from the fans is the faroese strongest weapon when it comes to challenging other bigger teams .
scotland already experienced what it means to go up against the underdogs after just barely snatching a lucky 2:2 draw in september .
scotland ’ s german coach berti vogts warned his compatriot völler not to underestimate the potential of the faroes : his team of highly-paid players is still nursing its bruises from the embarrassment .
völler himself seems to have taken the words to heart .
at the start of wednesday ’ s match , the german coach stressed that today their were no easy opponents in soccer .

although germany ’ s team beat the northern islanders in a european soccer qualification round , the real praise goes to the plucky underdogs who played a respectable game against the runner-up world champions . the faroe islands may be one of the minnows of european soccer , but the island team from the north sea gave the germans a good run in a qualification game on wednesday night in hanover .
despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .
we were strong on the defense , and we attempted a lot on the offense .
we also had a few shots at the goal , but we still have to train a lot more . ”
germany ’ s coach rudi völler admitted the game had brought his team down to earth from its lofty expectations : “ it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . ”
an underestimated force the tiny group of 18 islands located off the northern coast of scotland , between norway and iceland in the icy north sea , is certainly not the place one normally thinks about for hosting a soccer nation .
but , the faroe islands are not to be underestimated .
although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , the islanders can ’ t be topped in their enthusiasm for the sport .
nearly one in every eight residents is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
the genuine love for the game and the emotional support from the fans is the faroese strongest weapon when it comes to challenging other bigger teams .
scotland already experienced what it means to go up against the underdogs after just barely snatching a lucky 2:2 draw in september .
scotland ’ s german coach berti vogts warned his compatriot völler not to underestimate the potential of the faroes : his team of highly-paid players is still nursing its bruises from the embarrassment .
völler himself seems to have taken the words to heart .
at the start of wednesday ’ s match , the german coach stressed that today their were no easy opponents in soccer .
“ one shouldn ’ t make light of our challengers from the faroe islands , ” he reportedly told his players .
and at the end of the game , the germans certainly weren ’ t laughing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links facts about the faroe islands 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .
that is less prodi 's problem than that of the german and portuguese finance ministers .
it ’ s they who now have to explain to their long-suffering citizens that they are imposing austerity measures in compliance with eu regulations which the highest official in brussels officially describes as " stupid " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .

under new eu rules , german makers of the sheep and goat ’ s milk product can no longer call their cheese ‘ feta ’ .
that right is now solely held by greece .
the new regulations , agreed upon by the european commission on monday , state that only feta produced in certain parts of greece and according to traditional practices will be allowed to market itself as feta , despite the fact that the same cheese has been produced legally in germany since 1985 .
cheese twist it ’ s the latest twist in a european cheese-naming debacle and not the first time the eu has attempted to protect greek feta producers .
in 1996 , the european union awarded greece the sole right to market their product as ‘ feta ’ .
however three years later , the european court of justice overturned this ruling , after angry french , german and danish makers of the cheese brought a case against the ruling .
now , the new regulations effectively return things back to the way they were .
the real big cheese authentic greek feta is made solely from sheep or from a specific ratio of sheep and goat ’ s milk .
according to rules detailed in the greek food and beverages code , the cheese must mature for over two months in chambers where the temperature and humidity is strictly controlled .
authentic feta must also be free of preservatives and antibiotic substances .
these guidelines on correct feta production predate by far any eu decisions on the matter : archeologists have found evidence that the greeks were making correctly named feta as early as the time of homer ’ s " odyssey " .
fighting back but german and danish producers of the cheese are not ready to give up yet .
hans bender of the danish dairy board told dw-world : " we ’ ve been expecting these new rules for quite some time so we ’ re not really surprised .
we ’ ve been preparing for it . "
bender , who brought the initial 1996 case against the eu , called the new regulations " a nasty piece of mismanagement on the part of the european commission . "
" feta cheese has been produced in denmark since the 1930 ’ s and legally in germany since 1985 .
we ’ ve exported it to many countries , including greece and never received any complaints , " bender told dw-world .
erberhard hetzler , a spokesperson for the german dairy association agreed .
" in terms of taste , there is hardly any difference between feta cheese produced in greece and that produced in germany or denmark . "
" we will take every possible legal step to overturn this , " hetzler said work has already begun on a new case which germany , denmark and possibly also france , will bring before the european court of justice in december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.10.2002 brussels waves big stick over german deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister eichel says germany ca n't make deficit limit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "
caught between a rock and a hard place germany now finds itself in a double bind .
most experts agree that , faced with a slowing economy , the government would normally lower interest rates to try and fire it up again .
but interest rates across the euro-zone are set by the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , which is against any reduction , so this is an option that eichel no longer has .
his only other course of action is to use fiscal policy to support the economy , which is to a large extent ruled out by the stability pact 's three percent limit .
meeting in paris earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder and the french president , jacques chirac , agreed that the pact should be interpreted in a flexible way in view of the current international situation .
ecb president wim duisenberg has already rejected any relaxation of the three-percent rule .
germany ’ s conservatives cry foul germany ’ s conservative opposition says the deficit violation proves that the government deceived voters in the run-up to last month ’ s election .
the christian democrats ’ leader angela merkel called it " an outrage beyond description .
" even though the social democrats and their green allies have known this for a long time , " she said , " their forecasts were wrong .
this goes to show that schröder simply lied to the voters in the election . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal " mcberti " takes on his former team german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes german players pessimistic ahead of italy clash culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.10.2002 germany beats faroe islands by a hair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the next soccer power an archipelago in the north sea ?
although germany ’ s team beat the northern islanders in a european soccer qualification round , the real praise goes to the plucky underdogs who played a respectable game against the runner-up world champions . the faroe islands may be one of the minnows of european soccer , but the island team from the north sea gave the germans a good run in a qualification game on wednesday night in hanover .
despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .
we were strong on the defense , and we attempted a lot on the offense .
we also had a few shots at the goal , but we still have to train a lot more . ”
germany ’ s coach rudi völler admitted the game had brought his team down to earth from its lofty expectations : “ it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . ”
an underestimated force the tiny group of 18 islands located off the northern coast of scotland , between norway and iceland in the icy north sea , is certainly not the place one normally thinks about for hosting a soccer nation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.10.2002 brussels waves big stick over german deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister eichel says germany ca n't make deficit limit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "
caught between a rock and a hard place germany now finds itself in a double bind .
most experts agree that , faced with a slowing economy , the government would normally lower interest rates to try and fire it up again .
but interest rates across the euro-zone are set by the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , which is against any reduction , so this is an option that eichel no longer has .
his only other course of action is to use fiscal policy to support the economy , which is to a large extent ruled out by the stability pact 's three percent limit .
meeting in paris earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder and the french president , jacques chirac , agreed that the pact should be interpreted in a flexible way in view of the current international situation .
ecb president wim duisenberg has already rejected any relaxation of the three-percent rule .
germany ’ s conservatives cry foul germany ’ s conservative opposition says the deficit violation proves that the government deceived voters in the run-up to last month ’ s election .
the christian democrats ’ leader angela merkel called it " an outrage beyond description .
" even though the social democrats and their green allies have known this for a long time , " she said , " their forecasts were wrong .
this goes to show that schröder simply lied to the voters in the election . "
with business leaders saying new government plans to raise revenues and cut spending to plug holes in the 2003 budget will destroy jobs and kill off growth , it looks as if germans will have to prepare for a few lean years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .
that is less prodi 's problem than that of the german and portuguese finance ministers .
it ’ s they who now have to explain to their long-suffering citizens that they are imposing austerity measures in compliance with eu regulations which the highest official in brussels officially describes as " stupid " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .

governments also have a statutory duty to consult the public .
the agreement by eu environment ministers meeting in luxembourg gladdened the hearts of environmental groups but did little to hasten the process for the huge biotechnology firms waiting in the wings for approval for their crops .
since 1999 the eu has maintained a moratorium on approving new gm foods .
this , in effect , has stymied the process of biotechnology giants such as monsanto , aventis and dupont eager to cash in on the large and potentially lucrative european market .
they had hoped that the ministers would have proposed to lift the moratorium on growing the crops , but to no avail .
what thursday 's decision does mean for the firms , however , is that they can resubmit their applications with adjustments to the eu commission .
crop approval unlikely within a year however , there is still a lingering fear among environmentalists that the eu will lift its three-year moratorium on approving new gm products .
in an interview with bbc news , friends of the earth spokesperson geert ritsema said that although the new risk assessment procedures were welcome , " it 's definitely not enough to cover all the risks that genetically modified organisms pose to human health and the environment . "
the points of contention are labeling and traceability : what is the minimum amount of gm products present in a food to warrant labeling , and where were the crops grown ?
the eu commission proposed that food containing more than one percent should be labeled .
but this did not bode well with sweden , who insists on zero tolerance and britain , who opposes the labeling of food with minute traces arguing that it is neither practical nor achievable .
highly processed products like oils in which genetic modification can not be detected because the dna has been destroyed will also be subjected to labeling .
barrier to trade and industry the british government and the european commission are both eager to see the moratorium ended .
britain is concerned that its biotechnology industry is being held back by the delay , and the commission is worried that u.s. firms may sue over being jammed out of the european market .
" once again the uk government is putting the interests of the biotech industry ahead of consumers and the environment .
why else is the uk opposing european gm labeling rules when every other member supports them ? " said pete riley of friends of the earth in an interview with the guardian .
the squabbling has forced france , luxembourg , austria , greece , italy , denmark and belgium to maintain a ban , set in place since june 1999 , to block any gm products not already authorized in the eu from entering the market ahead of the new regulations .
" there are no reasons to lift the moratorium while the traceability and labeling laws are not in place , " said a french source at thursday 's meeting .
italy , denmark , luxembourg and greece have also proposed that the labeling extend to milk and eggs that are produced from animals raised on gm feed .

although germany ’ s team beat the northern islanders in a european soccer qualification round , the real praise goes to the plucky underdogs who played a respectable game against the runner-up world champions . the faroe islands may be one of the minnows of european soccer , but the island team from the north sea gave the germans a good run in a qualification game on wednesday night in hanover .
despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .
we were strong on the defense , and we attempted a lot on the offense .
we also had a few shots at the goal , but we still have to train a lot more . ”
germany ’ s coach rudi völler admitted the game had brought his team down to earth from its lofty expectations : “ it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . ”
an underestimated force the tiny group of 18 islands located off the northern coast of scotland , between norway and iceland in the icy north sea , is certainly not the place one normally thinks about for hosting a soccer nation .
but , the faroe islands are not to be underestimated .
although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , the islanders can ’ t be topped in their enthusiasm for the sport .
nearly one in every eight residents is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
the genuine love for the game and the emotional support from the fans is the faroese strongest weapon when it comes to challenging other bigger teams .
scotland already experienced what it means to go up against the underdogs after just barely snatching a lucky 2:2 draw in september .
scotland ’ s german coach berti vogts warned his compatriot völler not to underestimate the potential of the faroes : his team of highly-paid players is still nursing its bruises from the embarrassment .
völler himself seems to have taken the words to heart .
at the start of wednesday ’ s match , the german coach stressed that today their were no easy opponents in soccer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.10.2002 brussels waves big stick over german deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister eichel says germany ca n't make deficit limit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "
caught between a rock and a hard place germany now finds itself in a double bind .
most experts agree that , faced with a slowing economy , the government would normally lower interest rates to try and fire it up again .
but interest rates across the euro-zone are set by the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , which is against any reduction , so this is an option that eichel no longer has .
his only other course of action is to use fiscal policy to support the economy , which is to a large extent ruled out by the stability pact 's three percent limit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.10.2002 brussels waves big stick over german deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister eichel says germany ca n't make deficit limit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "
caught between a rock and a hard place germany now finds itself in a double bind .
most experts agree that , faced with a slowing economy , the government would normally lower interest rates to try and fire it up again .
but interest rates across the euro-zone are set by the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , which is against any reduction , so this is an option that eichel no longer has .
his only other course of action is to use fiscal policy to support the economy , which is to a large extent ruled out by the stability pact 's three percent limit .
meeting in paris earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder and the french president , jacques chirac , agreed that the pact should be interpreted in a flexible way in view of the current international situation .
ecb president wim duisenberg has already rejected any relaxation of the three-percent rule .

under new eu rules , german makers of the sheep and goat ’ s milk product can no longer call their cheese ‘ feta ’ .
that right is now solely held by greece .
the new regulations , agreed upon by the european commission on monday , state that only feta produced in certain parts of greece and according to traditional practices will be allowed to market itself as feta , despite the fact that the same cheese has been produced legally in germany since 1985 .
cheese twist it ’ s the latest twist in a european cheese-naming debacle and not the first time the eu has attempted to protect greek feta producers .
in 1996 , the european union awarded greece the sole right to market their product as ‘ feta ’ .
however three years later , the european court of justice overturned this ruling , after angry french , german and danish makers of the cheese brought a case against the ruling .
now , the new regulations effectively return things back to the way they were .
the real big cheese authentic greek feta is made solely from sheep or from a specific ratio of sheep and goat ’ s milk .
according to rules detailed in the greek food and beverages code , the cheese must mature for over two months in chambers where the temperature and humidity is strictly controlled .
authentic feta must also be free of preservatives and antibiotic substances .
these guidelines on correct feta production predate by far any eu decisions on the matter : archeologists have found evidence that the greeks were making correctly named feta as early as the time of homer ’ s " odyssey " .
fighting back but german and danish producers of the cheese are not ready to give up yet .
hans bender of the danish dairy board told dw-world : " we ’ ve been expecting these new rules for quite some time so we ’ re not really surprised .
we ’ ve been preparing for it . "
bender , who brought the initial 1996 case against the eu , called the new regulations " a nasty piece of mismanagement on the part of the european commission . "
" feta cheese has been produced in denmark since the 1930 ’ s and legally in germany since 1985 .
we ’ ve exported it to many countries , including greece and never received any complaints , " bender told dw-world .
erberhard hetzler , a spokesperson for the german dairy association agreed .
" in terms of taste , there is hardly any difference between feta cheese produced in greece and that produced in germany or denmark . "
" we will take every possible legal step to overturn this , " hetzler said work has already begun on a new case which germany , denmark and possibly also france , will bring before the european court of justice in december .
the end for german feta ?
but whatever the outcome of the case , as the rules stand now , all is not lost for german feta .
although the new rules came into force on monday , producers outside of greece have five years in which to lay down their cheese-making paddles or begin to market their product under a different name .
which begs the question : what on earth will they call it ? ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .

although germany ’ s team beat the northern islanders in a european soccer qualification round , the real praise goes to the plucky underdogs who played a respectable game against the runner-up world champions . the faroe islands may be one of the minnows of european soccer , but the island team from the north sea gave the germans a good run in a qualification game on wednesday night in hanover .
despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .
we were strong on the defense , and we attempted a lot on the offense .
we also had a few shots at the goal , but we still have to train a lot more . ”
germany ’ s coach rudi völler admitted the game had brought his team down to earth from its lofty expectations : “ it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . ”
an underestimated force the tiny group of 18 islands located off the northern coast of scotland , between norway and iceland in the icy north sea , is certainly not the place one normally thinks about for hosting a soccer nation .
but , the faroe islands are not to be underestimated .
although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , the islanders can ’ t be topped in their enthusiasm for the sport .
nearly one in every eight residents is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
the genuine love for the game and the emotional support from the fans is the faroese strongest weapon when it comes to challenging other bigger teams .
scotland already experienced what it means to go up against the underdogs after just barely snatching a lucky 2:2 draw in september .
scotland ’ s german coach berti vogts warned his compatriot völler not to underestimate the potential of the faroes : his team of highly-paid players is still nursing its bruises from the embarrassment .
völler himself seems to have taken the words to heart .
at the start of wednesday ’ s match , the german coach stressed that today their were no easy opponents in soccer .
“ one shouldn ’ t make light of our challengers from the faroe islands , ” he reportedly told his players .
and at the end of the game , the germans certainly weren ’ t laughing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links facts about the faroe islands 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "
caught between a rock and a hard place germany now finds itself in a double bind .
most experts agree that , faced with a slowing economy , the government would normally lower interest rates to try and fire it up again .
but interest rates across the euro-zone are set by the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , which is against any reduction , so this is an option that eichel no longer has .
his only other course of action is to use fiscal policy to support the economy , which is to a large extent ruled out by the stability pact 's three percent limit .
meeting in paris earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder and the french president , jacques chirac , agreed that the pact should be interpreted in a flexible way in view of the current international situation .
ecb president wim duisenberg has already rejected any relaxation of the three-percent rule .
germany ’ s conservatives cry foul germany ’ s conservative opposition says the deficit violation proves that the government deceived voters in the run-up to last month ’ s election .
the christian democrats ’ leader angela merkel called it " an outrage beyond description .
" even though the social democrats and their green allies have known this for a long time , " she said , " their forecasts were wrong .
this goes to show that schröder simply lied to the voters in the election . "

but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .
that is less prodi 's problem than that of the german and portuguese finance ministers .

although germany ’ s team beat the northern islanders in a european soccer qualification round , the real praise goes to the plucky underdogs who played a respectable game against the runner-up world champions . the faroe islands may be one of the minnows of european soccer , but the island team from the north sea gave the germans a good run in a qualification game on wednesday night in hanover .
despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .
we were strong on the defense , and we attempted a lot on the offense .
we also had a few shots at the goal , but we still have to train a lot more . ”
germany ’ s coach rudi völler admitted the game had brought his team down to earth from its lofty expectations : “ it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . ”
an underestimated force the tiny group of 18 islands located off the northern coast of scotland , between norway and iceland in the icy north sea , is certainly not the place one normally thinks about for hosting a soccer nation .
but , the faroe islands are not to be underestimated .
although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , the islanders can ’ t be topped in their enthusiasm for the sport .
nearly one in every eight residents is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
the genuine love for the game and the emotional support from the fans is the faroese strongest weapon when it comes to challenging other bigger teams .
scotland already experienced what it means to go up against the underdogs after just barely snatching a lucky 2:2 draw in september .
scotland ’ s german coach berti vogts warned his compatriot völler not to underestimate the potential of the faroes : his team of highly-paid players is still nursing its bruises from the embarrassment .
völler himself seems to have taken the words to heart .
at the start of wednesday ’ s match , the german coach stressed that today their were no easy opponents in soccer .
“ one shouldn ’ t make light of our challengers from the faroe islands , ” he reportedly told his players .
and at the end of the game , the germans certainly weren ’ t laughing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links facts about the faroe islands 9800 dw-tv europe live hin & weg we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .
we were strong on the defense , and we attempted a lot on the offense .
we also had a few shots at the goal , but we still have to train a lot more . ”
germany ’ s coach rudi völler admitted the game had brought his team down to earth from its lofty expectations : “ it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . ”
an underestimated force the tiny group of 18 islands located off the northern coast of scotland , between norway and iceland in the icy north sea , is certainly not the place one normally thinks about for hosting a soccer nation .
but , the faroe islands are not to be underestimated .
although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , the islanders can ’ t be topped in their enthusiasm for the sport .
nearly one in every eight residents is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
the genuine love for the game and the emotional support from the fans is the faroese strongest weapon when it comes to challenging other bigger teams .
scotland already experienced what it means to go up against the underdogs after just barely snatching a lucky 2:2 draw in september .
scotland ’ s german coach berti vogts warned his compatriot völler not to underestimate the potential of the faroes : his team of highly-paid players is still nursing its bruises from the embarrassment .
völler himself seems to have taken the words to heart .
at the start of wednesday ’ s match , the german coach stressed that today their were no easy opponents in soccer .
“ one shouldn ’ t make light of our challengers from the faroe islands , ” he reportedly told his players .
and at the end of the game , the germans certainly weren ’ t laughing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links facts about the faroe islands 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.10.2002 eu supremo undermines key deficit rule großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commission president romano prodi european commission president romano prodi said on thursday he recognised the eu ’ s stability and growth pact was too rigid .
but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .
that is less prodi 's problem than that of the german and portuguese finance ministers .
it ’ s they who now have to explain to their long-suffering citizens that they are imposing austerity measures in compliance with eu regulations which the highest official in brussels officially describes as " stupid " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .

the new regulations , agreed upon by the european commission on monday , state that only feta produced in certain parts of greece and according to traditional practices will be allowed to market itself as feta , despite the fact that the same cheese has been produced legally in germany since 1985 .
cheese twist it ’ s the latest twist in a european cheese-naming debacle and not the first time the eu has attempted to protect greek feta producers .
in 1996 , the european union awarded greece the sole right to market their product as ‘ feta ’ .
however three years later , the european court of justice overturned this ruling , after angry french , german and danish makers of the cheese brought a case against the ruling .
now , the new regulations effectively return things back to the way they were .
the real big cheese authentic greek feta is made solely from sheep or from a specific ratio of sheep and goat ’ s milk .
according to rules detailed in the greek food and beverages code , the cheese must mature for over two months in chambers where the temperature and humidity is strictly controlled .
authentic feta must also be free of preservatives and antibiotic substances .
these guidelines on correct feta production predate by far any eu decisions on the matter : archeologists have found evidence that the greeks were making correctly named feta as early as the time of homer ’ s " odyssey " .
fighting back but german and danish producers of the cheese are not ready to give up yet .
hans bender of the danish dairy board told dw-world : " we ’ ve been expecting these new rules for quite some time so we ’ re not really surprised .
we ’ ve been preparing for it . "
bender , who brought the initial 1996 case against the eu , called the new regulations " a nasty piece of mismanagement on the part of the european commission . "
" feta cheese has been produced in denmark since the 1930 ’ s and legally in germany since 1985 .
we ’ ve exported it to many countries , including greece and never received any complaints , " bender told dw-world .
erberhard hetzler , a spokesperson for the german dairy association agreed .
" in terms of taste , there is hardly any difference between feta cheese produced in greece and that produced in germany or denmark . "
" we will take every possible legal step to overturn this , " hetzler said work has already begun on a new case which germany , denmark and possibly also france , will bring before the european court of justice in december .
the end for german feta ?
but whatever the outcome of the case , as the rules stand now , all is not lost for german feta .
although the new rules came into force on monday , producers outside of greece have five years in which to lay down their cheese-making paddles or begin to market their product under a different name .
which begs the question : what on earth will they call it ? ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules . europe 's largest economy is facing a hefty fine from brussels because it ca n't stick to the rules of a pact it helped create .
german finance minister hans eichel confirmed on wednesday what many economists had been predicting all along : the country will exceed the three percent budget deficit limit required by the european union 's economic stability pact .
with the admission , eichel went back on earlier pledges that germany would on no account exceed the deficit limit .
he said lower-than-expected tax revenues resulting in a 10 billion euro budget shortfall had made new debt unavoidable .
he blamed the problems on a downturn in the world economy and said he was confident berlin would meet the stability pact targets in 2003 and 2004 .
the pact demands that the eu 's 16 nations not have budget deficits that exceed three percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the rules , which former german finance minister theo waigel helped draft , are intended to prevent countries within the eurozone from running lax fiscal policies at the expense of other eurozone members .
eu prepared to levy fine on germany berlin already avoided an official warning from the european commission in february by promising to balance its budget by 2004 .
but with italy and france also unlikely to balance their budgets within the next two years , the eu has now been forced to relax the rule , with 2006 the likely new deadline .
reacting to eichel 's announcement , eu finance commissioner pedro solbes said the commission would institute formal deficit violation proceedings against europe 's largest economy if it fails to meet the stability criteria .
the commission invoked the procedure for the first time earlier on wednesday , issuing an official warning to portugal for failing to meet the deficit criteria this year .
offending governments have to lodge a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp with the european commission at zero interest .
if the deficit is not corrected within two years , the deposit is converted into a fine , which in germany ’ s case could run into billions of euros .
the roots of the problem are mainly at home many experts believe the global economic slowdown is only partially to blame for germany ’ s current problems .
although the bursting of america ’ s economic bubble in particular has led to a cutback in foreign investment and a sharp fall in european share prices , german exports have still been growing .
the real cause of the weakness is a fall in consumer spending and investment , say economic observers .
this has also been compounded by a fall in revenues from taxation .
klaus zimmermann from the berlin-based german institute for economic research told dw-radio that eichel ’ s admission was expected .
" there are basically domestic reasons for the problem , " he says .
" last year ’ s tax reform was bound to result in steeply decreasing public revenues .
on the other hand the government was too anxious to keep to the deficit limit earlier this year and failed to take countermeasures when the economy was starting to cool . "
caught between a rock and a hard place germany now finds itself in a double bind .
most experts agree that , faced with a slowing economy , the government would normally lower interest rates to try and fire it up again .
but interest rates across the euro-zone are set by the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , which is against any reduction , so this is an option that eichel no longer has .
his only other course of action is to use fiscal policy to support the economy , which is to a large extent ruled out by the stability pact 's three percent limit .
meeting in paris earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder and the french president , jacques chirac , agreed that the pact should be interpreted in a flexible way in view of the current international situation .
ecb president wim duisenberg has already rejected any relaxation of the three-percent rule .
germany ’ s conservatives cry foul germany ’ s conservative opposition says the deficit violation proves that the government deceived voters in the run-up to last month ’ s election .
the christian democrats ’ leader angela merkel called it " an outrage beyond description .

although germany ’ s team beat the northern islanders in a european soccer qualification round , the real praise goes to the plucky underdogs who played a respectable game against the runner-up world champions . the faroe islands may be one of the minnows of european soccer , but the island team from the north sea gave the germans a good run in a qualification game on wednesday night in hanover .
despite losing 2:1 to this year ’ s second place world cup team , the faroe islands impressed soccer fans throughout europe with their give-it-all efforts , and embarrassed the german team by showing just how easy it is to slide in a goal .
plucky part-timers the faroe islands , which belong to denmark , were pitted as sure losers prior to the match .
predictions of a 7:0 or 8:0 walkover were considered realistic for a team made up largely of fishermen and part-time kickers .
but in the end , the danes were proud of their team ’ s defensive tactics .
“ after a fantastic display of fighting spirit dane henrik larsen ’ s faroese national team lost by only 2:1 ... and with a little luck it could have turned out much better , ” the danish newspaper b.t. said on thursday morning .
the team ’ s trainer , henrik larsen told the paper , “ we played a very good game .
i ’ m happy the whole world could see how good we play soccer .

but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .
that is less prodi 's problem than that of the german and portuguese finance ministers .

but do n't expect any big changes any time soon . after years of defending the european union ’ s budgetary regulations against member governments ’ attempts to water them down , european commission president romano prodi on thursday gave critics of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact fresh ammunition .
" i know very well that the stability pact is stupid , like all rigid decisions , " he told the french newspaper le monde .
prodi ’ s remarks came after germany , europe ’ s largest economy , admitted its budget deficit would exceed the three percent margin intended to enforce fiscal responsibility across the eurozone .
the pact ’ s credibility is at an all-time low .
portugal is also facing eu action for failing to limit its deficit and other member states are railing against the rigid guidelines .
one of those , france , is also close to the three percent deficit limit .
paris wants more budgetary leeway to counter sluggish economic growth .
finance minister francis mer seized on prodi ’ s comments .
" the president of the commission … himself declares and recognizes that the stability and growth pact may need to show a little more flexibility and a little less simplicity , " he told the french senate .
" i can only confirm what the president of the commission said . "
who should manage the eurozone economies ?
thursday ’ s blunt talking pushes the ongoing debate about who should manage the eurozone economies into the public forum .
prodi believes the commission should have the power to enforce economic cooperation within the single currency and is wary of relaxing budgetary discipline too far .
" if the three percent limit on public deficits was not there , it would not be possible to avoid big overshoots , " he told le monde .
" the stability pact is a means of unity within the currency . "
many eu finance ministers , however , want more freedom of action to deal with economic conditions , not less .
a special convention on europe 's future is already examining the options , but it is deeply divided on the issue .
german social democrat klaus hänsch , who leads the economics working group , is against any radical changes in the system , but a growing number of other members think it should be completely revamped – at the latest if or when britain joins the eurozone .
the global chief economist at lehman brothers ’ investment bank in london , john llewellyn , notes that the main difficulty in enforcing the pact in the current economic climate was that the eurozone ’ s three main economies – germany , france and italy – had not wiped out their budget deficits before they were hit by an economic downturn .
the eu last month extended the deadline for states to balance their budgets from 2004 to 2006 .
little chance of change soon plans to admit 10 new members into the eu are already sending tremors through european capitals , so there is little chance of a radical rethinking of the stability pact anytime soon .
that leaves commission officials with little choice but to play down the european central bank ’ s call for budgetary discipline and interpret the pact in a flexible manner .
" what would be stupid would be a rigid , dogmatic implementation which took no account of the realities of the situation , " the commission ’ s chief spokesman told jonathan faull said at a press briefing on thursday .
so , for the time being , europe will have to live with the current system .
the conservative challenger in germany ’ s recent general election , bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , told german television that prodi had himself to blame if the system was " stupid " and had shown himself unfit for office by undermining trust in the commission .
that is less prodi 's problem than that of the german and portuguese finance ministers .

richard bowker , chairman of the strategic rail authority , says rail companies must ' ' get a grip " on the price of major rail projects .
alarm bells are ringing after a four-fold increase in the cost of upgrading the west coast main line between london and glasgow to almost £ 10 billion .
there is a real worry that if costs rise in a way which becomes uncontrolled , then projects will become unaffordable richard bowker , chairman of the strategic rail authority that has raised fears that future modernisations of the east coast line between london and edinburgh , and the great western route between london , south wales and south-west england may have to be scaled back or postponed .
the government has ordered the authority to take charge of developing major rail schemes following the final removal of railtrack this month .
ministers have told network rail , the new company which has taken over the running of track and signals , to focus purely on operating and maintaining the existing system .
value for money in an interview with bbc news online , mr bowker says : " there is a real worry that if costs rise in a way which becomes uncontrolled , then projects will become unaffordable .
we 're not at that point yet , but we could get to that point if we do n't get a really tight grip on it . "
the west coast line has proven a bleeding artery mr bowker has told rail contractors that they must tackle sliding standards , bad planning and poorly managed track possessions .
the government has promised that £ 60 billion will be invested in rail over the next 10 years to meet forecasts of a 50 % growth in passengers .
but investment is likely to dry up unless the taxpayer gets good value for money .
mr bowker suggests time is short , but adds : ' ' that 's a cause for action , not a cause for panic at the moment . "
he knows his credibility with his ministerial bosses is on the line if he does not deliver .
mood of optimism transport secretary alistair darling says : " cost control is critical .
the numbers have got to make sense .
we can only justify the investment if the public can see its value and there are tangible results . "
bowker : railways must compete with road and air there is a new mood of optimism in the rail industry , following the removal of railtrack , creation of network rail and arrival of new leadership at the strategic rail authority .
passenger groups and train operators are beginning to believe once again that the industry has a bright future , and the government is willing to make long-term investment .
but that optimism is still fragile : if rail companies and contractors do not deliver punctual services and extra capacity at affordable prices , then mr bowker warns that rail will not be able to compete with cars , buses and planes .
if that happens , he says , the government support that is critical to the future of the railways will be lost .

however , since 2001 the payments are only made to ex-internees who were born in the uk or whose parents or grandparents were born in the uk .

they said the government 's refusal to make payments to their clients is " fundamentally unjust " in view of their " unique suffering " .
they point to the fact that before 2001 these people would have been entitled to compensation .
prior to the change in the law , anyone born in a crown colony was british independently of whether or not they or their parents and grandparents had been born in the uk .
