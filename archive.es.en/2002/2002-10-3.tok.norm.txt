program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2002 prominent frankfurt banker 's son murdered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police believe jakob von metzler died because he knew his abductor the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker in the financial metropolis of frankfurt , was found dead on tuesday after a four-day kidnapping ordeal .
the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .
several laid down flowers and wreaths in front of the metzler family ’ s villa as they tried to come to terms with the gruesome crime .
germany has history of prominent kidnappings the metzler bank , founded in 1674 , is one of germany ’ s oldest private financial institutions .
it has passed through 11 generations of the family , and has offices in munich , stuttgart , new york , los angeles , seattle , tokyo and dublin .
jakob von metzler ’ s kidnapping and subsequent murder is the just the latest in a series of high-profile kidnappings in germany in the past years .
in october 1996 , hamburg tobacco heir , jan philipp reetsma was abducted and held captive for one month before his captors freed him in return for 30 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 13 m -rrb- .
the main suspect was extradited from argentina for trial in germany in 2000 and sentenced to 14 years and six months in prison .
in the same year jakub fiszman , a frankfurt millionare businessman was kidnapped and murdered despite the payment of ransom of 4 million deutschmarks .
a suspect was later arrested .
mr fiszman ’ s six-year-old nephew , peter fiszman , was kidnapped in 1991 in cologne along with a schoolmate , but both were released two days later after a ransom was paid . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .
past discoveries in humour have revealed some important insights in the functionality of the brain . for example the simple joke : “ two fish in a tank .
one turns to the other and says ' do you know how to drive this ? " ' .
the punchline creates a feeling of surprise because it doesn ’ t seem to make any sense .
only a few minutes later does one realize the ambiguity of the word “ tank ” , and it is only then that one may find the situation funny . “ all of this involves many different types of brain activity ” , the british association for the advancement of science explains , “ – including linguistic processing , perception of incongruity and creativity in resolving the ambiguity . ” whereas experiments on the location of the perception of humour in the brain , or on how humour changes as humans develop , laugh lab sought to explore how humour differed between men and women and between nationalities , and will carry on the experiment looking at whether the timing of the punchline in a joke matters , too . sociable and healthy indeed there is more to mirth that meets the eye : laughter is to known to reduce stress and to be a boost to the immune system .
research shows people with heart disease are 40 per cent less likely to laugh in a variety of situations compared to others of the same age without heart disease . laughter is also thought to have an important evolutionary function , too : it is believed to have been a gesture of shared relief at the passing of danger , and a way of indicating true trust in one ’ s companions . in addition , laughter is social : people are 30 times more likely to laugh at a joke in company than when they hear the joke alone .
last but not least , laughing 100 times is equal to 10 minutes on a rowing machine . leaves the world ’ s funniest joke , as revealed by the latest scientific research : “ two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses .

german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .

he then became involved in its first restauration since the reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : undated handout photo by german telekom of a poster showing the white house seen behind the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , and the slogan " the world 's getting closer - t-mobile " .
a banner depicting this motive will be fixed at the brandenburg gate tuesday , may 21 , 2002 in order to welcome u.s. president george w. bush for his visit to germany from may 22 through 23 , 2002 .
the banner will cover the berlin landmark that is under construction for restauration works currently .
german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .
10 , 1989 file photo .
on november 9 , 1989 stunned east german border guards watched helplessly as jubilant germans danced on the berlin wall .
thousands crossed the border to experience long-forbidden freedoms and riches on that memorable night , which marked the downfall of the east german communist regime .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle , file -rrb- most of the east berliners don ’ t have the same kind of feelings about the brandenburg gate as people in the west do .
i guess for many of them , since the reunification hasn ’ t been so favorable or so good for them , they probably associate it with that , it ’ s like bad weather .
i imagine many of them are not eager to go to the brandenburg gate or be around it .
but there are many who love it and the art and architecture involved . you 've spent the better part of 12 years researching the brandenburg gate , poring through old files , pictures - aren ’ t you sick of it ?
no .
if you ask me , i ’ d like to do more .
there are lot of unanswered questions and i want to research them and i hope to have the time left in my life to do it .
there ’ s a lot of work .
you find little things that nobody has paid any attention to .
i ’ ve been doing the reichstag a lot and it keeps coming back up , so i keep getting involved and i ’ m happy to do it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2002 laughter in the lab großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humour plays a key role in worldwide brain research on thursday , the world 's funniest joke was revealed - the result of a tedious experiment which revealed just how different people from different parts of the world perceive a joke to be jolly . according to sue hordijenko , science communication manager at the british association for the advancement of science , it is the “ most far-reaching pyschology experiment ever ” : last year in october , the british association asked internet users around the world to submit their favourite puns and rate the funniness of other people ’ s submitted jokes .
on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .
past discoveries in humour have revealed some important insights in the functionality of the brain . for example the simple joke : “ two fish in a tank .

on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2002 prominent frankfurt banker 's son murdered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police believe jakob von metzler died because he knew his abductor the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker in the financial metropolis of frankfurt , was found dead on tuesday after a four-day kidnapping ordeal .
the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .

on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .
past discoveries in humour have revealed some important insights in the functionality of the brain . for example the simple joke : “ two fish in a tank .
one turns to the other and says ' do you know how to drive this ? " ' .
the punchline creates a feeling of surprise because it doesn ’ t seem to make any sense .
only a few minutes later does one realize the ambiguity of the word “ tank ” , and it is only then that one may find the situation funny . “ all of this involves many different types of brain activity ” , the british association for the advancement of science explains , “ – including linguistic processing , perception of incongruity and creativity in resolving the ambiguity . ” whereas experiments on the location of the perception of humour in the brain , or on how humour changes as humans develop , laugh lab sought to explore how humour differed between men and women and between nationalities , and will carry on the experiment looking at whether the timing of the punchline in a joke matters , too . sociable and healthy indeed there is more to mirth that meets the eye : laughter is to known to reduce stress and to be a boost to the immune system .
research shows people with heart disease are 40 per cent less likely to laugh in a variety of situations compared to others of the same age without heart disease . laughter is also thought to have an important evolutionary function , too : it is believed to have been a gesture of shared relief at the passing of danger , and a way of indicating true trust in one ’ s companions . in addition , laughter is social : people are 30 times more likely to laugh at a joke in company than when they hear the joke alone .
last but not least , laughing 100 times is equal to 10 minutes on a rowing machine . leaves the world ’ s funniest joke , as revealed by the latest scientific research : “ two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses .
he doesn ’ t seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed .
the other man pulls out his phone and calls emergency services . he gasps to the operator : “ my friend is dead !
what can i do ? ” the operator in a calm , soothing voice replies : “ take it easy .
i can help .
first , let ’ s make sure he ’ s dead . ” there is a silence , then a shot is heard . back on the phone , the hunter says , “ ok , now what ? ” . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links laugh lab homepage 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .
several laid down flowers and wreaths in front of the metzler family ’ s villa as they tried to come to terms with the gruesome crime .

it has passed through 11 generations of the family , and has offices in munich , stuttgart , new york , los angeles , seattle , tokyo and dublin .
jakob von metzler ’ s kidnapping and subsequent murder is the just the latest in a series of high-profile kidnappings in germany in the past years .
in october 1996 , hamburg tobacco heir , jan philipp reetsma was abducted and held captive for one month before his captors freed him in return for 30 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 13 m -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.10.2002 obsessing over a berlin landmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's love parade ravers are some of the gate 's biggest fans berlin historian and new york city native michael s. cullen recently finished work on a film about the brandenburg gate , which will be dramatically unveiled thursday after 20 months of repair work . michael s. cullen , a new york city native , has become one of berlin ’ s best known and most vocal local historians . he has written books and made documentaries about the german reichstag , the city 's old museum and the planned holocaust memorial . he first wrote a book about the brandenburg gate in 1990 , after a friend invited him up to the top of the gate immediately following reunification .
he then became involved in its first restauration since the reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : undated handout photo by german telekom of a poster showing the white house seen behind the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , and the slogan " the world 's getting closer - t-mobile " .
a banner depicting this motive will be fixed at the brandenburg gate tuesday , may 21 , 2002 in order to welcome u.s. president george w. bush for his visit to germany from may 22 through 23 , 2002 .
the banner will cover the berlin landmark that is under construction for restauration works currently .
german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2002 prominent frankfurt banker 's son murdered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police believe jakob von metzler died because he knew his abductor the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker in the financial metropolis of frankfurt , was found dead on tuesday after a four-day kidnapping ordeal .
the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .
several laid down flowers and wreaths in front of the metzler family ’ s villa as they tried to come to terms with the gruesome crime .
germany has history of prominent kidnappings the metzler bank , founded in 1674 , is one of germany ’ s oldest private financial institutions .
it has passed through 11 generations of the family , and has offices in munich , stuttgart , new york , los angeles , seattle , tokyo and dublin .
jakob von metzler ’ s kidnapping and subsequent murder is the just the latest in a series of high-profile kidnappings in germany in the past years .
in october 1996 , hamburg tobacco heir , jan philipp reetsma was abducted and held captive for one month before his captors freed him in return for 30 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 13 m -rrb- .
the main suspect was extradited from argentina for trial in germany in 2000 and sentenced to 14 years and six months in prison .
in the same year jakub fiszman , a frankfurt millionare businessman was kidnapped and murdered despite the payment of ransom of 4 million deutschmarks .
a suspect was later arrested .
mr fiszman ’ s six-year-old nephew , peter fiszman , was kidnapped in 1991 in cologne along with a schoolmate , but both were released two days later after a ransom was paid . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

he then became involved in its first restauration since the reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : undated handout photo by german telekom of a poster showing the white house seen behind the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , and the slogan " the world 's getting closer - t-mobile " .
a banner depicting this motive will be fixed at the brandenburg gate tuesday , may 21 , 2002 in order to welcome u.s. president george w. bush for his visit to germany from may 22 through 23 , 2002 .
the banner will cover the berlin landmark that is under construction for restauration works currently .
german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .
10 , 1989 file photo .
on november 9 , 1989 stunned east german border guards watched helplessly as jubilant germans danced on the berlin wall .
thousands crossed the border to experience long-forbidden freedoms and riches on that memorable night , which marked the downfall of the east german communist regime .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle , file -rrb- most of the east berliners don ’ t have the same kind of feelings about the brandenburg gate as people in the west do .
i guess for many of them , since the reunification hasn ’ t been so favorable or so good for them , they probably associate it with that , it ’ s like bad weather .
i imagine many of them are not eager to go to the brandenburg gate or be around it .
but there are many who love it and the art and architecture involved . you 've spent the better part of 12 years researching the brandenburg gate , poring through old files , pictures - aren ’ t you sick of it ?
no .
if you ask me , i ’ d like to do more .
there are lot of unanswered questions and i want to research them and i hope to have the time left in my life to do it .
there ’ s a lot of work .
you find little things that nobody has paid any attention to .

the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2002 laughter in the lab großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humour plays a key role in worldwide brain research on thursday , the world 's funniest joke was revealed - the result of a tedious experiment which revealed just how different people from different parts of the world perceive a joke to be jolly . according to sue hordijenko , science communication manager at the british association for the advancement of science , it is the “ most far-reaching pyschology experiment ever ” : last year in october , the british association asked internet users around the world to submit their favourite puns and rate the funniness of other people ’ s submitted jokes .
on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .
past discoveries in humour have revealed some important insights in the functionality of the brain . for example the simple joke : “ two fish in a tank .
one turns to the other and says ' do you know how to drive this ? " ' .
the punchline creates a feeling of surprise because it doesn ’ t seem to make any sense .
only a few minutes later does one realize the ambiguity of the word “ tank ” , and it is only then that one may find the situation funny . “ all of this involves many different types of brain activity ” , the british association for the advancement of science explains , “ – including linguistic processing , perception of incongruity and creativity in resolving the ambiguity . ” whereas experiments on the location of the perception of humour in the brain , or on how humour changes as humans develop , laugh lab sought to explore how humour differed between men and women and between nationalities , and will carry on the experiment looking at whether the timing of the punchline in a joke matters , too . sociable and healthy indeed there is more to mirth that meets the eye : laughter is to known to reduce stress and to be a boost to the immune system .
research shows people with heart disease are 40 per cent less likely to laugh in a variety of situations compared to others of the same age without heart disease . laughter is also thought to have an important evolutionary function , too : it is believed to have been a gesture of shared relief at the passing of danger , and a way of indicating true trust in one ’ s companions . in addition , laughter is social : people are 30 times more likely to laugh at a joke in company than when they hear the joke alone .
last but not least , laughing 100 times is equal to 10 minutes on a rowing machine . leaves the world ’ s funniest joke , as revealed by the latest scientific research : “ two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses .
he doesn ’ t seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed .
the other man pulls out his phone and calls emergency services . he gasps to the operator : “ my friend is dead !
what can i do ? ” the operator in a calm , soothing voice replies : “ take it easy .
i can help .
first , let ’ s make sure he ’ s dead . ” there is a silence , then a shot is heard . back on the phone , the hunter says , “ ok , now what ? ” . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links laugh lab homepage 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .
several laid down flowers and wreaths in front of the metzler family ’ s villa as they tried to come to terms with the gruesome crime .
germany has history of prominent kidnappings the metzler bank , founded in 1674 , is one of germany ’ s oldest private financial institutions .
it has passed through 11 generations of the family , and has offices in munich , stuttgart , new york , los angeles , seattle , tokyo and dublin .
jakob von metzler ’ s kidnapping and subsequent murder is the just the latest in a series of high-profile kidnappings in germany in the past years .
in october 1996 , hamburg tobacco heir , jan philipp reetsma was abducted and held captive for one month before his captors freed him in return for 30 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 13 m -rrb- .
the main suspect was extradited from argentina for trial in germany in 2000 and sentenced to 14 years and six months in prison .
in the same year jakub fiszman , a frankfurt millionare businessman was kidnapped and murdered despite the payment of ransom of 4 million deutschmarks .
a suspect was later arrested .

german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .

on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .
past discoveries in humour have revealed some important insights in the functionality of the brain . for example the simple joke : “ two fish in a tank .
one turns to the other and says ' do you know how to drive this ? " ' .
the punchline creates a feeling of surprise because it doesn ’ t seem to make any sense .
only a few minutes later does one realize the ambiguity of the word “ tank ” , and it is only then that one may find the situation funny . “ all of this involves many different types of brain activity ” , the british association for the advancement of science explains , “ – including linguistic processing , perception of incongruity and creativity in resolving the ambiguity . ” whereas experiments on the location of the perception of humour in the brain , or on how humour changes as humans develop , laugh lab sought to explore how humour differed between men and women and between nationalities , and will carry on the experiment looking at whether the timing of the punchline in a joke matters , too . sociable and healthy indeed there is more to mirth that meets the eye : laughter is to known to reduce stress and to be a boost to the immune system .
research shows people with heart disease are 40 per cent less likely to laugh in a variety of situations compared to others of the same age without heart disease . laughter is also thought to have an important evolutionary function , too : it is believed to have been a gesture of shared relief at the passing of danger , and a way of indicating true trust in one ’ s companions . in addition , laughter is social : people are 30 times more likely to laugh at a joke in company than when they hear the joke alone .
last but not least , laughing 100 times is equal to 10 minutes on a rowing machine . leaves the world ’ s funniest joke , as revealed by the latest scientific research : “ two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses .
he doesn ’ t seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2002 laughter in the lab großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humour plays a key role in worldwide brain research on thursday , the world 's funniest joke was revealed - the result of a tedious experiment which revealed just how different people from different parts of the world perceive a joke to be jolly . according to sue hordijenko , science communication manager at the british association for the advancement of science , it is the “ most far-reaching pyschology experiment ever ” : last year in october , the british association asked internet users around the world to submit their favourite puns and rate the funniness of other people ’ s submitted jokes .
on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .
past discoveries in humour have revealed some important insights in the functionality of the brain . for example the simple joke : “ two fish in a tank .
one turns to the other and says ' do you know how to drive this ? " ' .
the punchline creates a feeling of surprise because it doesn ’ t seem to make any sense .
only a few minutes later does one realize the ambiguity of the word “ tank ” , and it is only then that one may find the situation funny . “ all of this involves many different types of brain activity ” , the british association for the advancement of science explains , “ – including linguistic processing , perception of incongruity and creativity in resolving the ambiguity . ” whereas experiments on the location of the perception of humour in the brain , or on how humour changes as humans develop , laugh lab sought to explore how humour differed between men and women and between nationalities , and will carry on the experiment looking at whether the timing of the punchline in a joke matters , too . sociable and healthy indeed there is more to mirth that meets the eye : laughter is to known to reduce stress and to be a boost to the immune system .
research shows people with heart disease are 40 per cent less likely to laugh in a variety of situations compared to others of the same age without heart disease . laughter is also thought to have an important evolutionary function , too : it is believed to have been a gesture of shared relief at the passing of danger , and a way of indicating true trust in one ’ s companions . in addition , laughter is social : people are 30 times more likely to laugh at a joke in company than when they hear the joke alone .
last but not least , laughing 100 times is equal to 10 minutes on a rowing machine . leaves the world ’ s funniest joke , as revealed by the latest scientific research : “ two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses .
he doesn ’ t seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed .
the other man pulls out his phone and calls emergency services . he gasps to the operator : “ my friend is dead !
what can i do ? ” the operator in a calm , soothing voice replies : “ take it easy .
i can help .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2002 prominent frankfurt banker 's son murdered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police believe jakob von metzler died because he knew his abductor the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker in the financial metropolis of frankfurt , was found dead on tuesday after a four-day kidnapping ordeal .
the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .
several laid down flowers and wreaths in front of the metzler family ’ s villa as they tried to come to terms with the gruesome crime .
germany has history of prominent kidnappings the metzler bank , founded in 1674 , is one of germany ’ s oldest private financial institutions .
it has passed through 11 generations of the family , and has offices in munich , stuttgart , new york , los angeles , seattle , tokyo and dublin .
jakob von metzler ’ s kidnapping and subsequent murder is the just the latest in a series of high-profile kidnappings in germany in the past years .
in october 1996 , hamburg tobacco heir , jan philipp reetsma was abducted and held captive for one month before his captors freed him in return for 30 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 13 m -rrb- .
the main suspect was extradited from argentina for trial in germany in 2000 and sentenced to 14 years and six months in prison .
in the same year jakub fiszman , a frankfurt millionare businessman was kidnapped and murdered despite the payment of ransom of 4 million deutschmarks .
a suspect was later arrested .
mr fiszman ’ s six-year-old nephew , peter fiszman , was kidnapped in 1991 in cologne along with a schoolmate , but both were released two days later after a ransom was paid . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .
past discoveries in humour have revealed some important insights in the functionality of the brain . for example the simple joke : “ two fish in a tank .
one turns to the other and says ' do you know how to drive this ? " ' .
the punchline creates a feeling of surprise because it doesn ’ t seem to make any sense .
only a few minutes later does one realize the ambiguity of the word “ tank ” , and it is only then that one may find the situation funny . “ all of this involves many different types of brain activity ” , the british association for the advancement of science explains , “ – including linguistic processing , perception of incongruity and creativity in resolving the ambiguity . ” whereas experiments on the location of the perception of humour in the brain , or on how humour changes as humans develop , laugh lab sought to explore how humour differed between men and women and between nationalities , and will carry on the experiment looking at whether the timing of the punchline in a joke matters , too . sociable and healthy indeed there is more to mirth that meets the eye : laughter is to known to reduce stress and to be a boost to the immune system .
research shows people with heart disease are 40 per cent less likely to laugh in a variety of situations compared to others of the same age without heart disease . laughter is also thought to have an important evolutionary function , too : it is believed to have been a gesture of shared relief at the passing of danger , and a way of indicating true trust in one ’ s companions . in addition , laughter is social : people are 30 times more likely to laugh at a joke in company than when they hear the joke alone .
last but not least , laughing 100 times is equal to 10 minutes on a rowing machine . leaves the world ’ s funniest joke , as revealed by the latest scientific research : “ two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses .
he doesn ’ t seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed .
the other man pulls out his phone and calls emergency services . he gasps to the operator : “ my friend is dead !
what can i do ? ” the operator in a calm , soothing voice replies : “ take it easy .
i can help .
first , let ’ s make sure he ’ s dead . ” there is a silence , then a shot is heard . back on the phone , the hunter says , “ ok , now what ? ” . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links laugh lab homepage 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

he then became involved in its first restauration since the reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : undated handout photo by german telekom of a poster showing the white house seen behind the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , and the slogan " the world 's getting closer - t-mobile " .
a banner depicting this motive will be fixed at the brandenburg gate tuesday , may 21 , 2002 in order to welcome u.s. president george w. bush for his visit to germany from may 22 through 23 , 2002 .
the banner will cover the berlin landmark that is under construction for restauration works currently .
german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .

-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle , file -rrb- most of the east berliners don ’ t have the same kind of feelings about the brandenburg gate as people in the west do .
i guess for many of them , since the reunification hasn ’ t been so favorable or so good for them , they probably associate it with that , it ’ s like bad weather .
i imagine many of them are not eager to go to the brandenburg gate or be around it .
but there are many who love it and the art and architecture involved . you 've spent the better part of 12 years researching the brandenburg gate , poring through old files , pictures - aren ’ t you sick of it ?

but the initial euphoria following reunification has dwindled and many , especially in the east , face a hard new reality . the photos at the time went around the world . jubilant germans standing atop a man-made wall being systematically destroyed by both east and west , berlin ’ s brandenburg gate glowing in the background . the shocking scene , the november 9 , 1989 destruction of the berlin wall after 28 years of separation , prompted the diplomatic moves by both communist east germany and west germany that brought the two halves officially together on oct .
3 , 1990 . on thursday , germans will celebrate 12 years as a reunified country with a slew of festivities around the city ’ s newly-renovated brandenburg gate .
the gate , shrouded for the past 20 months while work was being done , will be unveiled in dramatic fashion by ski filmmaker and designer willy bogner .
german opera diva montserrat caballé will bring the festivities to a close . the feel-good day is a public holiday in germany , a time for newspaper editorial boards to pen deep and thought-provoking reflection on 12 years of a whole and complete germany .
politicians , including chancellor gerhard schröder , will attend church services and give speeches .
former us president bill clinton is even due in town , and will address the crowds in front of the brandenburg gate thursday after receiving a piece of sandstone left over from the recent renovation work . after the " first love , " a sobering reality for ordinary germans , especially those in the east , celebrating a reunified germany has been harder and harder as each year has passed .
the initial euphora has been replaced with the cold , hard reality of a slumping economy , an overburdened social welfare system and high unemployment rates . reunification , such a great idea following the wall ’ s collapse , has been questioned more and more as the years have gone by . “ the reunification , as an adventure is only a memory of a euphoric feeling , like the first love , ” wrote an editorialist in the “ berliner zeitung ” on wednesday . the years since have become a monotous and exasperating existence for both sides , marked by ever-depressing statistics .
eastern flood into the west on tuesday , germany ’ s statistics office announced that the number of east germans moving west has increased again for the first time since 1991 .
around 98,000 moved from the economically-depressed , 17.5 percent unemployment rate of the former east to ecnomically better-off states in the west of the country in 2001 .
from 1991 to 2001 , 600,000 more people moved from east to west , than the other way around , according to the federal statistics office . the outlook looks grim : only 16 percent of east germans see their future turning around for the better in the coming five years according to a recent survey . the news has become obvious political fodder , with many of the country ’ s top officials reflecting on the serious problems ahead of the reunification fesitvities . “ when we celebrate this occasion we must also remember that we have a lot of work to do , ” klaus wowereit , berlin ’ s mayor said on wednesday . the spokesman for parliamentarians from former east german states , günter nooke said that east and west germans need to wipe away preconceptions they have of one another . “ today , it ’ s more important than ever for people from the east and the west to take up contact and work towards eliminating prejudices , ” nooke said . easier said than done in a country , where an “ wall of the mind ” has lived on long after the last pieces of wall concrete were sold to the city 's eager tourists . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de obsessing over a berlin landmark berlin historian and new york city native michael s. cullen recently finished work on a film about the brandenburg gate , which will be dramatically unveiled thursday after 20 months of repair work .

he then became involved in its first restauration since the reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : undated handout photo by german telekom of a poster showing the white house seen behind the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , and the slogan " the world 's getting closer - t-mobile " .
a banner depicting this motive will be fixed at the brandenburg gate tuesday , may 21 , 2002 in order to welcome u.s. president george w. bush for his visit to germany from may 22 through 23 , 2002 .
the banner will cover the berlin landmark that is under construction for restauration works currently .
german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .
10 , 1989 file photo .
on november 9 , 1989 stunned east german border guards watched helplessly as jubilant germans danced on the berlin wall .
thousands crossed the border to experience long-forbidden freedoms and riches on that memorable night , which marked the downfall of the east german communist regime .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle , file -rrb- most of the east berliners don ’ t have the same kind of feelings about the brandenburg gate as people in the west do .
i guess for many of them , since the reunification hasn ’ t been so favorable or so good for them , they probably associate it with that , it ’ s like bad weather .
i imagine many of them are not eager to go to the brandenburg gate or be around it .
but there are many who love it and the art and architecture involved . you 've spent the better part of 12 years researching the brandenburg gate , poring through old files , pictures - aren ’ t you sick of it ?
no .
if you ask me , i ’ d like to do more .
there are lot of unanswered questions and i want to research them and i hope to have the time left in my life to do it .
there ’ s a lot of work .
you find little things that nobody has paid any attention to .
i ’ ve been doing the reichstag a lot and it keeps coming back up , so i keep getting involved and i ’ m happy to do it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

but the initial euphoria following reunification has dwindled and many , especially in the east , face a hard new reality . the photos at the time went around the world . jubilant germans standing atop a man-made wall being systematically destroyed by both east and west , berlin ’ s brandenburg gate glowing in the background . the shocking scene , the november 9 , 1989 destruction of the berlin wall after 28 years of separation , prompted the diplomatic moves by both communist east germany and west germany that brought the two halves officially together on oct .
3 , 1990 . on thursday , germans will celebrate 12 years as a reunified country with a slew of festivities around the city ’ s newly-renovated brandenburg gate .
the gate , shrouded for the past 20 months while work was being done , will be unveiled in dramatic fashion by ski filmmaker and designer willy bogner .
german opera diva montserrat caballé will bring the festivities to a close . the feel-good day is a public holiday in germany , a time for newspaper editorial boards to pen deep and thought-provoking reflection on 12 years of a whole and complete germany .

the initial euphora has been replaced with the cold , hard reality of a slumping economy , an overburdened social welfare system and high unemployment rates . reunification , such a great idea following the wall ’ s collapse , has been questioned more and more as the years have gone by . “ the reunification , as an adventure is only a memory of a euphoric feeling , like the first love , ” wrote an editorialist in the “ berliner zeitung ” on wednesday . the years since have become a monotous and exasperating existence for both sides , marked by ever-depressing statistics .
eastern flood into the west on tuesday , germany ’ s statistics office announced that the number of east germans moving west has increased again for the first time since 1991 .

from 1991 to 2001 , 600,000 more people moved from east to west , than the other way around , according to the federal statistics office . the outlook looks grim : only 16 percent of east germans see their future turning around for the better in the coming five years according to a recent survey . the news has become obvious political fodder , with many of the country ’ s top officials reflecting on the serious problems ahead of the reunification fesitvities . “ when we celebrate this occasion we must also remember that we have a lot of work to do , ” klaus wowereit , berlin ’ s mayor said on wednesday . the spokesman for parliamentarians from former east german states , günter nooke said that east and west germans need to wipe away preconceptions they have of one another . “ today , it ’ s more important than ever for people from the east and the west to take up contact and work towards eliminating prejudices , ” nooke said . easier said than done in a country , where an “ wall of the mind ” has lived on long after the last pieces of wall concrete were sold to the city 's eager tourists . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de obsessing over a berlin landmark berlin historian and new york city native michael s. cullen recently finished work on a film about the brandenburg gate , which will be dramatically unveiled thursday after 20 months of repair work .

on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .
past discoveries in humour have revealed some important insights in the functionality of the brain . for example the simple joke : “ two fish in a tank .
one turns to the other and says ' do you know how to drive this ? " ' .
the punchline creates a feeling of surprise because it doesn ’ t seem to make any sense .
only a few minutes later does one realize the ambiguity of the word “ tank ” , and it is only then that one may find the situation funny . “ all of this involves many different types of brain activity ” , the british association for the advancement of science explains , “ – including linguistic processing , perception of incongruity and creativity in resolving the ambiguity . ” whereas experiments on the location of the perception of humour in the brain , or on how humour changes as humans develop , laugh lab sought to explore how humour differed between men and women and between nationalities , and will carry on the experiment looking at whether the timing of the punchline in a joke matters , too . sociable and healthy indeed there is more to mirth that meets the eye : laughter is to known to reduce stress and to be a boost to the immune system .
research shows people with heart disease are 40 per cent less likely to laugh in a variety of situations compared to others of the same age without heart disease . laughter is also thought to have an important evolutionary function , too : it is believed to have been a gesture of shared relief at the passing of danger , and a way of indicating true trust in one ’ s companions . in addition , laughter is social : people are 30 times more likely to laugh at a joke in company than when they hear the joke alone .
last but not least , laughing 100 times is equal to 10 minutes on a rowing machine . leaves the world ’ s funniest joke , as revealed by the latest scientific research : “ two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses .
he doesn ’ t seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed .
the other man pulls out his phone and calls emergency services . he gasps to the operator : “ my friend is dead !
what can i do ? ” the operator in a calm , soothing voice replies : “ take it easy .
i can help .
first , let ’ s make sure he ’ s dead . ” there is a silence , then a shot is heard . back on the phone , the hunter says , “ ok , now what ? ” . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links laugh lab homepage 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the initial euphoria following reunification has dwindled and many , especially in the east , face a hard new reality . the photos at the time went around the world . jubilant germans standing atop a man-made wall being systematically destroyed by both east and west , berlin ’ s brandenburg gate glowing in the background . the shocking scene , the november 9 , 1989 destruction of the berlin wall after 28 years of separation , prompted the diplomatic moves by both communist east germany and west germany that brought the two halves officially together on oct .
3 , 1990 . on thursday , germans will celebrate 12 years as a reunified country with a slew of festivities around the city ’ s newly-renovated brandenburg gate .
the gate , shrouded for the past 20 months while work was being done , will be unveiled in dramatic fashion by ski filmmaker and designer willy bogner .
german opera diva montserrat caballé will bring the festivities to a close . the feel-good day is a public holiday in germany , a time for newspaper editorial boards to pen deep and thought-provoking reflection on 12 years of a whole and complete germany .
politicians , including chancellor gerhard schröder , will attend church services and give speeches .
former us president bill clinton is even due in town , and will address the crowds in front of the brandenburg gate thursday after receiving a piece of sandstone left over from the recent renovation work . after the " first love , " a sobering reality for ordinary germans , especially those in the east , celebrating a reunified germany has been harder and harder as each year has passed .
the initial euphora has been replaced with the cold , hard reality of a slumping economy , an overburdened social welfare system and high unemployment rates . reunification , such a great idea following the wall ’ s collapse , has been questioned more and more as the years have gone by . “ the reunification , as an adventure is only a memory of a euphoric feeling , like the first love , ” wrote an editorialist in the “ berliner zeitung ” on wednesday . the years since have become a monotous and exasperating existence for both sides , marked by ever-depressing statistics .

he then became involved in its first restauration since the reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : undated handout photo by german telekom of a poster showing the white house seen behind the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , and the slogan " the world 's getting closer - t-mobile " .
a banner depicting this motive will be fixed at the brandenburg gate tuesday , may 21 , 2002 in order to welcome u.s. president george w. bush for his visit to germany from may 22 through 23 , 2002 .
the banner will cover the berlin landmark that is under construction for restauration works currently .
german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .
10 , 1989 file photo .
on november 9 , 1989 stunned east german border guards watched helplessly as jubilant germans danced on the berlin wall .
thousands crossed the border to experience long-forbidden freedoms and riches on that memorable night , which marked the downfall of the east german communist regime .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle , file -rrb- most of the east berliners don ’ t have the same kind of feelings about the brandenburg gate as people in the west do .
i guess for many of them , since the reunification hasn ’ t been so favorable or so good for them , they probably associate it with that , it ’ s like bad weather .
i imagine many of them are not eager to go to the brandenburg gate or be around it .
but there are many who love it and the art and architecture involved . you 've spent the better part of 12 years researching the brandenburg gate , poring through old files , pictures - aren ’ t you sick of it ?
no .
if you ask me , i ’ d like to do more .
there are lot of unanswered questions and i want to research them and i hope to have the time left in my life to do it .
there ’ s a lot of work .
you find little things that nobody has paid any attention to .
i ’ ve been doing the reichstag a lot and it keeps coming back up , so i keep getting involved and i ’ m happy to do it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .
past discoveries in humour have revealed some important insights in the functionality of the brain . for example the simple joke : “ two fish in a tank .
one turns to the other and says ' do you know how to drive this ? " ' .
the punchline creates a feeling of surprise because it doesn ’ t seem to make any sense .
only a few minutes later does one realize the ambiguity of the word “ tank ” , and it is only then that one may find the situation funny . “ all of this involves many different types of brain activity ” , the british association for the advancement of science explains , “ – including linguistic processing , perception of incongruity and creativity in resolving the ambiguity . ” whereas experiments on the location of the perception of humour in the brain , or on how humour changes as humans develop , laugh lab sought to explore how humour differed between men and women and between nationalities , and will carry on the experiment looking at whether the timing of the punchline in a joke matters , too . sociable and healthy indeed there is more to mirth that meets the eye : laughter is to known to reduce stress and to be a boost to the immune system .
research shows people with heart disease are 40 per cent less likely to laugh in a variety of situations compared to others of the same age without heart disease . laughter is also thought to have an important evolutionary function , too : it is believed to have been a gesture of shared relief at the passing of danger , and a way of indicating true trust in one ’ s companions . in addition , laughter is social : people are 30 times more likely to laugh at a joke in company than when they hear the joke alone .
last but not least , laughing 100 times is equal to 10 minutes on a rowing machine . leaves the world ’ s funniest joke , as revealed by the latest scientific research : “ two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses .

but the initial euphoria following reunification has dwindled and many , especially in the east , face a hard new reality . the photos at the time went around the world . jubilant germans standing atop a man-made wall being systematically destroyed by both east and west , berlin ’ s brandenburg gate glowing in the background . the shocking scene , the november 9 , 1989 destruction of the berlin wall after 28 years of separation , prompted the diplomatic moves by both communist east germany and west germany that brought the two halves officially together on oct .
3 , 1990 . on thursday , germans will celebrate 12 years as a reunified country with a slew of festivities around the city ’ s newly-renovated brandenburg gate .
the gate , shrouded for the past 20 months while work was being done , will be unveiled in dramatic fashion by ski filmmaker and designer willy bogner .
german opera diva montserrat caballé will bring the festivities to a close . the feel-good day is a public holiday in germany , a time for newspaper editorial boards to pen deep and thought-provoking reflection on 12 years of a whole and complete germany .
politicians , including chancellor gerhard schröder , will attend church services and give speeches .
former us president bill clinton is even due in town , and will address the crowds in front of the brandenburg gate thursday after receiving a piece of sandstone left over from the recent renovation work . after the " first love , " a sobering reality for ordinary germans , especially those in the east , celebrating a reunified germany has been harder and harder as each year has passed .
the initial euphora has been replaced with the cold , hard reality of a slumping economy , an overburdened social welfare system and high unemployment rates . reunification , such a great idea following the wall ’ s collapse , has been questioned more and more as the years have gone by . “ the reunification , as an adventure is only a memory of a euphoric feeling , like the first love , ” wrote an editorialist in the “ berliner zeitung ” on wednesday . the years since have become a monotous and exasperating existence for both sides , marked by ever-depressing statistics .
eastern flood into the west on tuesday , germany ’ s statistics office announced that the number of east germans moving west has increased again for the first time since 1991 .
around 98,000 moved from the economically-depressed , 17.5 percent unemployment rate of the former east to ecnomically better-off states in the west of the country in 2001 .
from 1991 to 2001 , 600,000 more people moved from east to west , than the other way around , according to the federal statistics office . the outlook looks grim : only 16 percent of east germans see their future turning around for the better in the coming five years according to a recent survey . the news has become obvious political fodder , with many of the country ’ s top officials reflecting on the serious problems ahead of the reunification fesitvities . “ when we celebrate this occasion we must also remember that we have a lot of work to do , ” klaus wowereit , berlin ’ s mayor said on wednesday . the spokesman for parliamentarians from former east german states , günter nooke said that east and west germans need to wipe away preconceptions they have of one another . “ today , it ’ s more important than ever for people from the east and the west to take up contact and work towards eliminating prejudices , ” nooke said . easier said than done in a country , where an “ wall of the mind ” has lived on long after the last pieces of wall concrete were sold to the city 's eager tourists . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de obsessing over a berlin landmark berlin historian and new york city native michael s. cullen recently finished work on a film about the brandenburg gate , which will be dramatically unveiled thursday after 20 months of repair work .

he then became involved in its first restauration since the reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : undated handout photo by german telekom of a poster showing the white house seen behind the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , and the slogan " the world 's getting closer - t-mobile " .
a banner depicting this motive will be fixed at the brandenburg gate tuesday , may 21 , 2002 in order to welcome u.s. president george w. bush for his visit to germany from may 22 through 23 , 2002 .
the banner will cover the berlin landmark that is under construction for restauration works currently .
german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .
10 , 1989 file photo .
on november 9 , 1989 stunned east german border guards watched helplessly as jubilant germans danced on the berlin wall .
thousands crossed the border to experience long-forbidden freedoms and riches on that memorable night , which marked the downfall of the east german communist regime .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle , file -rrb- most of the east berliners don ’ t have the same kind of feelings about the brandenburg gate as people in the west do .
i guess for many of them , since the reunification hasn ’ t been so favorable or so good for them , they probably associate it with that , it ’ s like bad weather .
i imagine many of them are not eager to go to the brandenburg gate or be around it .
but there are many who love it and the art and architecture involved . you 've spent the better part of 12 years researching the brandenburg gate , poring through old files , pictures - aren ’ t you sick of it ?
no .
if you ask me , i ’ d like to do more .
there are lot of unanswered questions and i want to research them and i hope to have the time left in my life to do it .
there ’ s a lot of work .
you find little things that nobody has paid any attention to .
i ’ ve been doing the reichstag a lot and it keeps coming back up , so i keep getting involved and i ’ m happy to do it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live kick off !

he then became involved in its first restauration since the reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : undated handout photo by german telekom of a poster showing the white house seen behind the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , and the slogan " the world 's getting closer - t-mobile " .
a banner depicting this motive will be fixed at the brandenburg gate tuesday , may 21 , 2002 in order to welcome u.s. president george w. bush for his visit to germany from may 22 through 23 , 2002 .
the banner will cover the berlin landmark that is under construction for restauration works currently .
german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .
10 , 1989 file photo .
on november 9 , 1989 stunned east german border guards watched helplessly as jubilant germans danced on the berlin wall .
thousands crossed the border to experience long-forbidden freedoms and riches on that memorable night , which marked the downfall of the east german communist regime .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle , file -rrb- most of the east berliners don ’ t have the same kind of feelings about the brandenburg gate as people in the west do .
i guess for many of them , since the reunification hasn ’ t been so favorable or so good for them , they probably associate it with that , it ’ s like bad weather .
i imagine many of them are not eager to go to the brandenburg gate or be around it .
but there are many who love it and the art and architecture involved . you 've spent the better part of 12 years researching the brandenburg gate , poring through old files , pictures - aren ’ t you sick of it ?
no .
if you ask me , i ’ d like to do more .
there are lot of unanswered questions and i want to research them and i hope to have the time left in my life to do it .
there ’ s a lot of work .
you find little things that nobody has paid any attention to .
i ’ ve been doing the reichstag a lot and it keeps coming back up , so i keep getting involved and i ’ m happy to do it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

eastern flood into the west on tuesday , germany ’ s statistics office announced that the number of east germans moving west has increased again for the first time since 1991 .
around 98,000 moved from the economically-depressed , 17.5 percent unemployment rate of the former east to ecnomically better-off states in the west of the country in 2001 .
from 1991 to 2001 , 600,000 more people moved from east to west , than the other way around , according to the federal statistics office . the outlook looks grim : only 16 percent of east germans see their future turning around for the better in the coming five years according to a recent survey . the news has become obvious political fodder , with many of the country ’ s top officials reflecting on the serious problems ahead of the reunification fesitvities . “ when we celebrate this occasion we must also remember that we have a lot of work to do , ” klaus wowereit , berlin ’ s mayor said on wednesday . the spokesman for parliamentarians from former east german states , günter nooke said that east and west germans need to wipe away preconceptions they have of one another . “ today , it ’ s more important than ever for people from the east and the west to take up contact and work towards eliminating prejudices , ” nooke said . easier said than done in a country , where an “ wall of the mind ” has lived on long after the last pieces of wall concrete were sold to the city 's eager tourists . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de obsessing over a berlin landmark berlin historian and new york city native michael s. cullen recently finished work on a film about the brandenburg gate , which will be dramatically unveiled thursday after 20 months of repair work .

the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .
several laid down flowers and wreaths in front of the metzler family ’ s villa as they tried to come to terms with the gruesome crime .
germany has history of prominent kidnappings the metzler bank , founded in 1674 , is one of germany ’ s oldest private financial institutions .
it has passed through 11 generations of the family , and has offices in munich , stuttgart , new york , los angeles , seattle , tokyo and dublin .
jakob von metzler ’ s kidnapping and subsequent murder is the just the latest in a series of high-profile kidnappings in germany in the past years .
in october 1996 , hamburg tobacco heir , jan philipp reetsma was abducted and held captive for one month before his captors freed him in return for 30 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 13 m -rrb- .

at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .

the initial euphora has been replaced with the cold , hard reality of a slumping economy , an overburdened social welfare system and high unemployment rates . reunification , such a great idea following the wall ’ s collapse , has been questioned more and more as the years have gone by . “ the reunification , as an adventure is only a memory of a euphoric feeling , like the first love , ” wrote an editorialist in the “ berliner zeitung ” on wednesday . the years since have become a monotous and exasperating existence for both sides , marked by ever-depressing statistics .
eastern flood into the west on tuesday , germany ’ s statistics office announced that the number of east germans moving west has increased again for the first time since 1991 .
around 98,000 moved from the economically-depressed , 17.5 percent unemployment rate of the former east to ecnomically better-off states in the west of the country in 2001 .
from 1991 to 2001 , 600,000 more people moved from east to west , than the other way around , according to the federal statistics office . the outlook looks grim : only 16 percent of east germans see their future turning around for the better in the coming five years according to a recent survey . the news has become obvious political fodder , with many of the country ’ s top officials reflecting on the serious problems ahead of the reunification fesitvities . “ when we celebrate this occasion we must also remember that we have a lot of work to do , ” klaus wowereit , berlin ’ s mayor said on wednesday . the spokesman for parliamentarians from former east german states , günter nooke said that east and west germans need to wipe away preconceptions they have of one another . “ today , it ’ s more important than ever for people from the east and the west to take up contact and work towards eliminating prejudices , ” nooke said . easier said than done in a country , where an “ wall of the mind ” has lived on long after the last pieces of wall concrete were sold to the city 's eager tourists . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de obsessing over a berlin landmark berlin historian and new york city native michael s. cullen recently finished work on a film about the brandenburg gate , which will be dramatically unveiled thursday after 20 months of repair work .

the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .
several laid down flowers and wreaths in front of the metzler family ’ s villa as they tried to come to terms with the gruesome crime .
germany has history of prominent kidnappings the metzler bank , founded in 1674 , is one of germany ’ s oldest private financial institutions .

he then became involved in its first restauration since the reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : undated handout photo by german telekom of a poster showing the white house seen behind the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , and the slogan " the world 's getting closer - t-mobile " .
a banner depicting this motive will be fixed at the brandenburg gate tuesday , may 21 , 2002 in order to welcome u.s. president george w. bush for his visit to germany from may 22 through 23 , 2002 .
the banner will cover the berlin landmark that is under construction for restauration works currently .
german telekom is the main sponsor of the works .
-lrb- ap photo / deutsche telekom -rrb- the gate , covered for the last 20 months as its sandstone facade is cleaned will be unveiled in dramatic fashion on thursday , germany ’ s reunification day .
at around the same time , berlin tv will air a documentary on the 211-year-old gate produced by cullen and colleagues , wilma pradetto and hans von brescius . cullen spoke with dw-world ’ s andreas tzortzis about the gate that has been a part of his life for the better part of the last 12 years . was the brandenburg gate always an important symbol for berlin , always part of its identity ? until the quadriga -lrb- the horse and chariot statue crowning it -rrb- was taken away , it was part of the city , but it wasn ’ t extremely a part of the city .
you didn ’ t get to see the brandenburg gate if you were in another part of town because there was basically no way to get to it .
berliners began to notice it when berlin was occupied by the french in 1806 and when napoleon took it away they began to miss it .
the situation was like that for 6 1/2 to 7 years and in 1814 the prussian allies defeated napoleon in leipzig and the victorious allies entered paris and found the quadriga .
it took them 50 days on the road to bring it back and the return trip became a triumphal procession … they had beaten napoleon , this was a wonderful symbol of prussia getting back on its feet again . what did it mean to the city afterwards ? it acquired a symbol of being berlin ’ s identification and of course it ’ s been made into a symbol of victory . i think that 's because it ’ s very good looking .
it ’ s been in the way , it ’ s been a traffic problem .
the nazis even tried to use it and did , but they never got to the point where it was identified as an evil building the way the reichstag was .
because of the fire and hitler and his speeches , the reichstag has always had a very nasty reputation .
with the brandenburg gate you have no problems with it , nobody has any problems identifying with it and i like that . what sort of a place does it hold in modern berlin ? nowadays it ’ s a symbol of berlin , it became a symbol of the end of the cold war because -lrb- former berlin mayor richard von -rrb- weizacker had made a statement when he was mayor of the city from 1981 to 1984 : “ as long as the brandenburg gate is closed , the german question is open . ”
so , the brandenburg gate is open , the german question is closed - theoretically it should be that way .
you could say that most of the german questions or problems have been solved and the brandenburg gate is a symbol of that , it ’ s a symbol of normality . is there a difference in the way residents of former east berlin and west berliners look at the gate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelers stand on the berlin wall to celebrate the opening of the east-west german borders , in berlin in this nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.10.2002 reunification blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " like the first love " twelve years ago , east and west germany agreed to come together , ending a 28-year division .
but the initial euphoria following reunification has dwindled and many , especially in the east , face a hard new reality . the photos at the time went around the world . jubilant germans standing atop a man-made wall being systematically destroyed by both east and west , berlin ’ s brandenburg gate glowing in the background . the shocking scene , the november 9 , 1989 destruction of the berlin wall after 28 years of separation , prompted the diplomatic moves by both communist east germany and west germany that brought the two halves officially together on oct .
3 , 1990 . on thursday , germans will celebrate 12 years as a reunified country with a slew of festivities around the city ’ s newly-renovated brandenburg gate .
the gate , shrouded for the past 20 months while work was being done , will be unveiled in dramatic fashion by ski filmmaker and designer willy bogner .
german opera diva montserrat caballé will bring the festivities to a close . the feel-good day is a public holiday in germany , a time for newspaper editorial boards to pen deep and thought-provoking reflection on 12 years of a whole and complete germany .
politicians , including chancellor gerhard schröder , will attend church services and give speeches .
former us president bill clinton is even due in town , and will address the crowds in front of the brandenburg gate thursday after receiving a piece of sandstone left over from the recent renovation work . after the " first love , " a sobering reality for ordinary germans , especially those in the east , celebrating a reunified germany has been harder and harder as each year has passed .
the initial euphora has been replaced with the cold , hard reality of a slumping economy , an overburdened social welfare system and high unemployment rates . reunification , such a great idea following the wall ’ s collapse , has been questioned more and more as the years have gone by . “ the reunification , as an adventure is only a memory of a euphoric feeling , like the first love , ” wrote an editorialist in the “ berliner zeitung ” on wednesday . the years since have become a monotous and exasperating existence for both sides , marked by ever-depressing statistics .
eastern flood into the west on tuesday , germany ’ s statistics office announced that the number of east germans moving west has increased again for the first time since 1991 .
around 98,000 moved from the economically-depressed , 17.5 percent unemployment rate of the former east to ecnomically better-off states in the west of the country in 2001 .
from 1991 to 2001 , 600,000 more people moved from east to west , than the other way around , according to the federal statistics office . the outlook looks grim : only 16 percent of east germans see their future turning around for the better in the coming five years according to a recent survey . the news has become obvious political fodder , with many of the country ’ s top officials reflecting on the serious problems ahead of the reunification fesitvities . “ when we celebrate this occasion we must also remember that we have a lot of work to do , ” klaus wowereit , berlin ’ s mayor said on wednesday . the spokesman for parliamentarians from former east german states , günter nooke said that east and west germans need to wipe away preconceptions they have of one another . “ today , it ’ s more important than ever for people from the east and the west to take up contact and work towards eliminating prejudices , ” nooke said . easier said than done in a country , where an “ wall of the mind ” has lived on long after the last pieces of wall concrete were sold to the city 's eager tourists . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de obsessing over a berlin landmark berlin historian and new york city native michael s. cullen recently finished work on a film about the brandenburg gate , which will be dramatically unveiled thursday after 20 months of repair work .

the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2002 prominent frankfurt banker 's son murdered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police believe jakob von metzler died because he knew his abductor the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker in the financial metropolis of frankfurt , was found dead on tuesday after a four-day kidnapping ordeal .
the case is the latest in a history of high-profile abductions in germany . the brutal death of 11-year-old jakob von metzler was confirmed on tuesday evening after police officials found a sack with his corpse near a lake in schlüchtern , a town north-east of frankfurt in the german state of hessen .
officials believe that jakob von metzler was killed either by suffocation or drowning four days ago , on the day he was kidnapped .
police have arrested a 27-year-old law student from frankfurt , magnus g , a friend of the metzler family , on suspicion of carrying out the crime .
they believe that magnus g was acting alone .
a court in frankfurt has pressed charges against the law student for murder and kidnapping on ransom .
if convicted , the arrested man faces a term of life imprisonment .
kidnapping drama ends tragically the death of jakob von metzler brings a four-day kidnapping ordeal to a tragic end .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banker ’ s family in frankfurt was last seen by a schoolmate on friday morning as he made his way home from the bus stop after school .
jakob however never made it home .
an hour later the metzler family received a ransom note from the kidnapper demanding a million euro and the promise that jakob would be freed unhurt after the ransom was paid .
but after the 11-year-old didn ’ t turn up even after the payment of the ransom on sunday , the police went public with a feverish search for jakob on monday involving some 1000 officials combing the wooded surroundings of schlüchtern for traces .
three further suspected persons aged between 16 and 23 arrested by the police on monday were freed on lack of evidence .
but one of them tipped off the police that jakob was probably being held in a hut near the lake in schlüchtern .
jakob knew his abductor while investigators are tight-lipped about information related to the suspected perpetrator and his motives , police are suspecting that jakob probably willingly got into magnus g ’ s car on the morning of the kidnapping because he knew him .
the law student , who lived opposite the bus stop where jakob was last seen , was known to the metzler family and is reported to have made friendly overtures to jakob ’ s 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister in the past .
it still remains unclear whether magnus g was an extra tutor of the children .
though the law student has still not explicitly admitted the crime to the police , investigators have found a large sum of money in his apartment .
magnus g is also known to the police on account of another crime .
horrendous crime the head of frankfurt ’ s police , harald weiss-bollandt , who personally informed the anguished metzler family of their son ’ s death , spoke of a " crime despicable of humanity " .
the police , he said had tried " everything humanly possible " to save the life of the boy .
" unfortunately , we didn ’ t seem to succeed , " he said .
state premier of hessen , roland koch of the christian democratic union said he was deeply shocked and paid his condolences to the metzler family .
" it ’ s incomprehensible , that people can do something so horrible to a child , " he said .
residents of the frankfurt district of sachsenhausen reacted with shock and anger at the crime .
several laid down flowers and wreaths in front of the metzler family ’ s villa as they tried to come to terms with the gruesome crime .
germany has history of prominent kidnappings the metzler bank , founded in 1674 , is one of germany ’ s oldest private financial institutions .
it has passed through 11 generations of the family , and has offices in munich , stuttgart , new york , los angeles , seattle , tokyo and dublin .
jakob von metzler ’ s kidnapping and subsequent murder is the just the latest in a series of high-profile kidnappings in germany in the past years .
in october 1996 , hamburg tobacco heir , jan philipp reetsma was abducted and held captive for one month before his captors freed him in return for 30 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 13 m -rrb- .
the main suspect was extradited from argentina for trial in germany in 2000 and sentenced to 14 years and six months in prison .
in the same year jakub fiszman , a frankfurt millionare businessman was kidnapped and murdered despite the payment of ransom of 4 million deutschmarks .
a suspect was later arrested .
mr fiszman ’ s six-year-old nephew , peter fiszman , was kidnapped in 1991 in cologne along with a schoolmate , but both were released two days later after a ransom was paid . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on thursday , the world ’ s funniest joke was revealed . ratings on the laughometer according to dr. richard wiseman of the university of hertfordshire , who devised the experiment called “ laugh lab ” with the association , “ the response has been enormous ” .
more than 100 000 people from 70 countries took part in the project , more than 40 , 000 were submitted in less than one year . in the joke review process , a user , after disclosing limited personal information including gender , age and nationality , was confronted with 5 jokes , picked at random from all those previously submitted .
the user was then asked for a laughometer rating on each .
data from this process was then saved in a database and used by the scientists in their analysis of the “ funniest joke of the world ” . according to dr. wisemann it was possible to determine major differences between what people found funny , both between sexes , and between nationalities . males ’ top jokes for instance involved aggression , putting women down and sexual innuendo . in contrast , females preferred jokes involving word plays . “ these findings reflect fundamental differences in the ways in which males and females use humour ” , pyschologist dr. richard wiseman said . national divergence in addition , reasearchers discovered large differences between what people from various nations found funny : while participants from the uk , ireland , australia and new zealand prefered word play , americans and canadians favoured jokes in which people were made to look stupid . europeans , meanwhile , favoured gags that were surreal or made fun of serious subjects such as illness , death and marriage .
in scotland , for example , death was a particularly prominent feature .
in the uk , animals featured in the british participants ’ favourite puns . in addition , of the countries rating the highest number of jokes , germans – perhaps surprisingly – laughed the most , closely followed by france , belgium and australia . “ this is an intriguing finding ” , remarked dr. wiseman , “ and we will be carrying out more research to discover exactly what is going on here ” . key role in brain research humour is a scientific field which has seen intense research .
past discoveries in humour have revealed some important insights in the functionality of the brain . for example the simple joke : “ two fish in a tank .
one turns to the other and says ' do you know how to drive this ? " ' .
the punchline creates a feeling of surprise because it doesn ’ t seem to make any sense .
only a few minutes later does one realize the ambiguity of the word “ tank ” , and it is only then that one may find the situation funny . “ all of this involves many different types of brain activity ” , the british association for the advancement of science explains , “ – including linguistic processing , perception of incongruity and creativity in resolving the ambiguity . ” whereas experiments on the location of the perception of humour in the brain , or on how humour changes as humans develop , laugh lab sought to explore how humour differed between men and women and between nationalities , and will carry on the experiment looking at whether the timing of the punchline in a joke matters , too . sociable and healthy indeed there is more to mirth that meets the eye : laughter is to known to reduce stress and to be a boost to the immune system .
research shows people with heart disease are 40 per cent less likely to laugh in a variety of situations compared to others of the same age without heart disease . laughter is also thought to have an important evolutionary function , too : it is believed to have been a gesture of shared relief at the passing of danger , and a way of indicating true trust in one ’ s companions . in addition , laughter is social : people are 30 times more likely to laugh at a joke in company than when they hear the joke alone .
last but not least , laughing 100 times is equal to 10 minutes on a rowing machine . leaves the world ’ s funniest joke , as revealed by the latest scientific research : “ two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses .

and city council bosses say the cost of policing , re-housing , counselling and legal services topped the £ 10m mark . £ 1,322 for each victim - although the mental and physical costs for each victim can not be put into financial terms sunderland city council a university spokesman said : " these incidents were reported by 2,700 victims - mostly women .
" but because so few women tend to report abuse to the police , the university team has calculated that there was actually in the region of 14,000 incidents like this , affecting 8,000 women in sunderland .
" that 's almost 10 % of the city 's female population . "
violent crime a spokesman for sunderland city council said : " the cost of providing legal services , housing , counselling and social services has therefore been put at £ 10m .
" that is £ 1,322 for each victim - although the mental and physical costs for each victim can not be put into financial terms . "
nationally , the crown prosecution service deals with 13,000 cases of domestic violence a year .
one-third of all murders in england and wales are classed as ' domestic incidents ' .
this kind of crime accounts for a quarter of all violent crime .

the exhibition in huntingdon has been organised by the department for transport to show its plans for uk air services over the next 30 years .
the alconbury airfield was earmarked in july as a potential site for a freight and low-cost airport to help cope with the estimated rise in demand for air travel .
the proposals have caused concern among local residents and conservationists , as well as councillors in huntingdon and neighbouring northamptonshire .
local jobs the new airport , which could open in 2011 , might handle up to five million passengers and one million tonnes of freight a year by 2030 .
if it was built , a rail link would be needed and the a1 -lrb- m -rrb- / a14 road junction would have to be improved .
ministers claim the airport could create about 12,000 jobs , mainly for local people .
however , when the plans were unveiled in july , huntingdon councillors were concerned over whether the area could cope with an airport .
protest letter over the county boundary in east northamptonshire , councillors voted in september in favour of writing to the secretary of state protesting at the plans .
and a spokesman for the campaign for the protection of rural england said last month that the site would be better used to ease development problems in the area , rather than for an airport .
the exhibition at the marriott hotel on kingfisher way in huntingdon will be open from 0900 bst to 2100 bst .
it is one of a series of exhibitions organised by the department for transport as part of its consultation process , which ends on 30 november .

heizo takenaka , appointed financial services minister on monday as well as keeping his job as economics minister , has kicked off a top-to-bottom review of banking policy .
but while investors are sick of the trillions in bad debts crippling the banking system and want reform , they are also scared that the pain caused by any cure could be unbearable .
the result : a mass selloff of banking stocks on thursday , driving the benchmark nikkei down below the key 9,000 level to yet another 19-year lows as fears of a ' hard landing ' grew .
the nikkei index of leading shares closed down 1.25 % at 8,936.43 , the lowest finish since august 1983 .
global selloff not all the declines could be put down to concern that the government will force banks to accept public funds in exchange for more honesty about their problem loans .
heavy falls on wall street overnight had accompanied bad news from a string of companies , including chipmaker amd which warned of rising inventories and falling sales - a worrying echo of the situation as the tech boom turned to bust two years ago .
the dow jones index had ended the session in new york down 2.3 % , with the tech-heavy nasdaq composite down 2.1 % .
but the main influence was undoubtedly the banking worries , exacerbated by news that former central banker and key reformer takeshi kimura is to join mr takenaka 's new banking task force .
of the four biggest banks in japan , the largest - mizuho - and the smallest , ufj , were worst hit by the selloff .
both fell the full extent of their daily limit , or about 15 % .
the extent of concern about mizuho and ufj was demonstrated by the fate of shares in the other two big players in the banking sector .
shares in mitsubishi tokyo financial group and sumitomo mitsui both fell by much smaller amounts .

in a note sent to clients , morgan stanley economist andy xie said the dispute risked " horrendous " consequences if it lasts longer than a month .
the consequences for the global economy are horrendous andy xie morgan stanley over $ 1bn -lrb- £ 640m -rrb- worth of goods pass into the us by ship from east asia every day , he said , and a prolonged disruption could ravage the " just-in-time " production systems used across asia .
the weak recovery seen in many asian countries is export-led , and a slump in sales overseas to the us , by far the biggest market , could cause serious damage .
japan 's carmakers are keen to take advantage of continuing high demand for automobiles in the us , but are now looking at temporary closures of their us plants as parts imported from factories in asia grow scarce .
going into reverse ?
the latest figures show that almost every asian exporter bar singapore and indonesia has seen a sharp slowdown in deliveries to the us over the past two years .
but in 2002 the slowdown has abated .
malaysia , thailand , south korea and china are showing export growth that in some cases is reaching 10 % in a single three-month period .
los angeles alone normally brings in more than 300 containers a day of furniture alone , while computer equipment fills another 150 .
that is now grinding to a halt as the containers stack up on the west coast .
" if the port shutdown lasts , it will inflict severe damage on the region 's economies , " wrote mr xie .
" indeed , i believe that if the shutdown lasts more than a month , east asia would be in recession .
" the consequences for the global economy are horrendous . "
the lockout at the ports involves about 10,500 workers , who had been working to the strict terms of their contracts to get management back to the negotiating table .

the 15th century ship was uncovered in the banks of the river usk during construction work on a new arts and theatre complex for wales ' newest city .
a £ 3.5m welsh assembly government grant to preserve the craft was pledged in august after a high-profile campaign mounted by archaeologists .
but it has emerged that cash refers only to restoration of the main hull .
newport councillors meet on thursday to examine whether the money will extend to the rest of the ship .
activists believe the ship to be of national significance and older than the tudor ship , mary rose .
thousands of people flocked to the bank of the usk during the summer as contractors made way for archaeologists ' attempts to lift the boat .
many locals have found an affinity with newport 's new discovery at a time when the city is finding its feet as wales ' third metropolis .
the bow and the stern are still buried at the site .
museum ship timbers are being stored in water tanks at corus ' nearby llanwern steelworks - preventing erosion by air - until a decision on their eventual fate is made .
the remains of the ship will be displayed at their planned resting place in newport 's new arts centre , scheduled for a 2004 opening .
visitors will be able to see it through a glass floor , and there will also be a viewing gallery on the lower level .
but unless councillors can find a way to raise yet more money , the prized relic could be without its bow and stern .
the value ascribed by historians to the vessel could then be lost forever .

after us stock markets closed on on tuesday evening , the company warned investors that its revenues for the july-september quarter would be 18 % down on what it had predicted .
the weakness is not entirely surprising , but the magnitude of the miss is dan scovel needham & co worse still , the persistent weakness in the pc market means that inventories are building up - one of the key symptoms that heralded the end of the 1990s tech boom .
investors punished amd , with trading in the after-hours market pushing its shares down $ 1.10 or 20.5 % to $ 4.27 .
the result of the sales shortfall - $ 500m instead of its earlier predictions of more than $ 600m - is likely to be a fat operating loss , the company admitted , with the shelves beginning to stack up with unsold stock .
the last three months of the year should show an improvement , said chief financial officer robert rivet , claiming to be in a " much-improved position take advantage of the anticipated seasonal improvements in demand " .
amd 's problems are partly specific to the company itself , analysts said .
" amd is not getting the benefit of having the highest-end processors in the marketplace , and that hurts their ability to support their average selling prices , " said dan scovel of needham & co .
" the weakness is not entirely surprising , but the magnitude of the miss is . "
broader woes but even intel , the giant in the microprocessor world thanks to the dominant position of its pentium chips and its close relationship with software leviathan microsoft , is suffering .
its own financial position is certainly more healthy than amd 's , having predicted in september that sales would be at the lower end of expectations of $ 6.3bn- $ 6.9bn.

after us stock markets closed on on tuesday evening , the company warned investors that its revenues for the july-september quarter would be 18 % down on what it had predicted . "
the weakness is not entirely surprising , but the magnitude of the miss is " dan scovel needham & co worse still , the persistent weakness in the pc market means that inventories are building up - one of the key symptoms that heralded the end of the 1990s tech boom .
investors punished amd , with trading in the after-hours market pushing its shares down $ 1.10 or 20.5 % to $ 4.27 .
the result of the sales shortfall - $ 500m instead of its earlier predictions of more than $ 600m - is likely to be a fat operating loss , the company admitted , with the shelves beginning to stack up with unsold stock .
the last three months of the year should show an improvement , said chief financial officer robert rivet , claiming to be in a " much-improved position take advantage of the anticipated seasonal improvements in demand " .
amd 's problems are partly specific to the company itself , analysts said .
" amd is not getting the benefit of having the highest-end processors in the marketplace , and that hurts their ability to support their average selling prices , " said dan scovel of needham & co .
" the weakness is not entirely surprising , but the magnitude of the miss is . "
broader woes but even intel , the giant in the microprocessor world thanks to the dominant position of its pentium chips and its close relationship with software leviathan microsoft , is suffering .
its own financial position is certainly more healthy than amd 's , having predicted in september that sales would be at the lower end of expectations of $ 6.3bn- $ 6.9bn.
but it too is seeing inventory buildup , as demand for new pcs languishes .
forecasts from investment bank investec warn that third quarter pc shipments worldwide are likely to rise just 5 % , rather than the usual 10-15 % .

the dna blueprints of the malaria parasite and the mosquito which transmits it to humans have been completed .
the data will help experts to develop new treatments for the disease which is one of the world 's biggest killers .
nine out 10 malaria cases occur in sub-saharan africa .
bbc health correspondent chris hogg has been to kilifi , in eastern kenya , to report on the fight against the disease there , and the possible impact of this latest research .
it 's 11am .
the outpatients department at kilifi district hospital has been busy since first light .
fieldworker epson kahindi is trying to find out what might be wrong with sidi charo 's six-month-old son . "
it is simply the commonest serious illness that children get right across africa " professor kevin marsh dr michael makanga is a clinical pharmacologist working with the wellcome trust .
" the fieldworkers here , they help to screen out children that are presented with malaria ; symptoms that are suggestive of malaria , " he told me .
the nurse takes a blood sample from sidi 's baby son .
if he does have malaria , dr makanga 's team will try to include him in their latest clinical trial .
" when they come over to the research outpatients clinic we check the blood for the presence of any malaria parasites , " dr makanga said .
" at the same time we tell them about the investigation drug , the risks and benefits - and this is administered in their local language so that they clearly understand all about the studies . "
child killer most families here are only too willing to take part in these studies .
malaria is a deadly disease which kills hundreds of thousands of the youngest children .
the head of the kemri research centre here in kilifi is professor kevin marsh . "
the current drugs will not be there forever " professor gilbert kokwaro " during the malaria season the outpatients here will be packed , " he said .
" it 's pretty busy as you can hear today but it 'll be packed with hundreds of children every day all suffering from malaria .
" it is simply the commonest serious illness that children get right across africa it 's there all the time . "
at the wellcome trust laboratories in kenya , they are already using data from the genome project .
the malaria parasite passes into the blood stream when you are bitten by an infected mosquito .
the problem is the parasite evolving constantly - developing resistance to new treatments .
greater understanding professor gilbert kokwaro says that now the parasite 's genome has been sequenced - that is reduced it to its smallest constituent parts - researchers have gained a much better sense of how it works .
" the current drugs will not be there forever and what the genome project has done is really to give us the opportunity to look at the parasite in more detail and hopefully identify new targets for future drug development . "
" having the genome sequence is absolutely crucial " professor kevin marsh sequencing the genome of the malarial parasite is a big step .
the more you know about the organism the easier it is to find ways to destroy it .
but we are not going to see new drugs or even a new vaccine produced overnight as a result of this work .
so in villages like this , health workers concentrate on prevention and trying to spot the disease as early as possible .
the youngest children in bicharo ngumbao - a homestead about an hour 's drive from the hospital - are used to the visits from the health workers now .
regular checks on the basic health of those growing up here help researchers to plot how malaria moves through the local population .
and as one of the epidemiologists , tabitha mwangi , told me , the information collected will be used to test the effects of new vaccines or treatments on people living here in years to come .
" this is very important because if you do introduce an intervention , for example if you bring bednets or if you have a vaccine , especially once a good vaccine is found and is brought down to the field - then it 's very easy to say this was what the situation was before the vaccine .
" you monitor in the same way then you 'll be able to tell that the vaccine actually has an effect - or it does n't have an effect . "
meanwhile , much simpler innovations are also being developed to contain the spread of the disease .
village shop the village shopkeeper harrison koi has been trained to spot the symptoms of a malarial fever and sell the appropriate drugs to treat it .
early intervention can mean the difference between life and death .
wilfred mutemi from kenya 's ministry of health says it 's more realistic than expecting mothers to travel long distances to a hospital .
" we train them basically to discuss with the mother the signs that the mothers have noticed in their children when they come to buy drugs .
" they should be able to identify what drugs they should give these fevers for every fever they should add an anti-malarial drug and an adequate dose for that fever . "
on the children 's ward back at kilifi district hospital already many of the beds are filled with malaria cases , even though it 'll be some weeks before the height of the malaria season .
professor kevin marsh 's team of doctors care for patients here in addition to carrying out their research work .
" there is an enormous amount which can be done right now in terms of prevention of malaria , of development and implementation of new drugs .
" it is essential that that carries on at the same pace because that is what 's just allowing us to keep up with the problem .
" but at the same time there has got to be a long term programme to develop new approaches .
" essentially , the best hope must come from the development of a vaccine and that 's i think where having the genome sequence is absolutely crucial . "
the next generation will be looking to the genome project to produce new treatments to combat this disease .
for communities blighted by malaria , these treatments ca n't come soon enough .

even after a lot of probing about who might appear in cardiff , all that is confirmed is that hornblower star ioan gruffudd did " enjoy " appearing on the show during its london run .

david and victoria beckham have even been linked to a role , although all mccoll will say on that subject is : " they have n't appeared yet . "
as for next year , mccoll believes the broadway run can be as successful as london , even though the eric and ernie never made it big across the pond .

a draught of wine loosens the tongue , cements the bonds of friendship and inspires brave acts , but can it really pull a country out of crisis ?
argentina has become a byword for economic misery - it has been in recession for four years .
the desert soil of mendoza helps the wine " everyone asks me , ' how 's your family ? ' - almost as if they are offering their condolences , " says laura catena , the daughter of one of argentina 's top wine producers .
" but in fact we have never been more enthusiastic .
the company must do well , we must drag the country out of this crisis . "
unlike so many businesses crippled by argentina 's economic crisis , ms catena 's family firm is prospering .
the vineyard 's exports to the us are growing by about 30 % a year , and its new world wines are garnering international prizes .
" it 's invigorating , it 's almost a patriotic feeling .
we have such great expectations , " she says .
centenary the catena zapata winery was founded in argentina 's mendoza region 100 years ago by an italian immigrant - ms catena 's greatgrandfather .
the poor desert soil , the high altitude and low rainfall provided an unlikely haven for the young vines .
the business celebrates its centenary this year " the plant has to suffer to give a good wine , " says ms catena .
" smaller berries give a more intense flavour . "
ms catena 's father , nicolas , now runs the $ 40m -lrb- £ 26m -rrb- business , with three vineyards and a long list of brands , including argento .
based in san francisco with her husband and two young children , ms catena is vice president of the company .
her pivotal role in the business , however , has only developed over the past five years .

sleeping giant ?
argentina is the fifth largest producer of wine worldwide .
but most of the wine is drunk domestically and exports - $ 128m -lrb- £ 82.2m -rrb- last year - do not match those of other regional producers , such as chile .
in the past decade , however , argentina has started to switch from producing large amounts of table wine to smaller quantities of higher-quality brands for export .
foreign winemakers are eyeing up mendoza ms catena 's father was at the forefront of this movement and spent 10 years developing his vineyards to make the step-up in quality .
" many people told him he was crazy , " she says .
" but he knew the survival of the company depended on exports . "
more recently mendoza has caught the attention of foreign wine producers , with companies such as spain 's freixenet buying up local wineries .
father-love ms catena is insistent , however , that the family-run catena zapata will not sell out .
the family feeling runs strong - her regard for her father rivals even her passion for making wine .
catena 's father " believes women work harder " " he has a bias for women , which is very unusual in argentina .
" he believes women work harder and are more creative - i think he even trusts women more . "
notably , argentina 's first master of wine , marina gayan , who now works for hardy europe , used to be in charge of exports at catena zapata .

following the birth of her second child , she was able to drink wine again " guilt-free " .

earlier this year the us department of commerce imposed tariffs on european producers of low enriched uranium -lrb- leu -rrb- , claiming they received unfair state subsidises .
it has an impact on us of several million dollars a year mark elliot , urenco the commission , which values the leu exports at $ 500m -lrb- £ 320m -rrb- - or one third of the us market - has condemned the duties as " illegal " .
an eu spokeswoman told bbc news online it had failed to reach an " amicable " solution after months of talks with the us and would now seek to refer the case to the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- .
" we are not going to sit and wait , " the spokeswoman for trade commissioner pascal lamy said .
" we will send our final consultation documentation to our member states in the next couple of weeks and do not expect any obstacles " .
the dispute over uranium the follows spats between the us and europe over corporate tax breaks and trade in steel , bananas and beef .
leu is used to fuel in nuclear power plants and is not weapons grade material .
nuclear refinement two years ago , the only us enricher of uranium , the recently privatised us enrichment corporation -lrb- usec -rrb- , lodged a complaint against the french government 's eurodif and urenco , a uk-dutch-german government consortium .
an investigation last year by the international trade commission -lrb- itc -rrb- , the us body which recommends the imposition of duties , reported that " subsidised " european leu was harming the domestic industry .
urenco received state-subsidies in the 70s and 80s as a result , eurodif now pays an extra 34 % duty , and urenco 2.23 % , on exports to the us .
the european commission estimates usec will receive about $ 100m in extra annual income from the duties .
" it has an impact on us of several million dollars a year , but its not crippling , " mark elliot , general manager of marketing at urenco , told bbc news online .
" they accused urenco of receiving state subsidies in the 70s and 80s and the itc established that we were innocent of most accusations , but had not fully repaid a small number of subsidies according to their rules . "
review due urenco , which is part owned by british nuclear fuels , disputes the findings and plans to appeal to the us court of international trade .
we 're not contemplating a counter claim against usec , but they themselves have had government subsidies in the past mark elliot , urenco the itc also found state-owned power company electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- had bought eurodif 's uranium at about 13 % above market prices , and that the proceeds were then used to bankroll the sale the metal in the us at 19.5 % below usec prices .
the us department of commerce is expected to review the case in january .
russian connection usec has a monopoly on uranium enrichment in the us and is the world 's leading supplier of fuel to nuclear power plants .
the company is also the only middleman for recycling weapons grade material from decommissioned russian nuclear warheads .
the us government hopes the deal will keep the material out of terrorist hands .
but brussels believes usec 's state-conferred monopoly over the russian reprocessing should have been considered by the itc in its decision .

private power " we 're not contemplating a counter claim against usec , but they themselves have had government subsidies in the past , " mr elliott said .
the us company , which was privatised amid heavy criticism in 1998 , operates government-owned enrichment plants in kentucky and ohio .
since privatisation it has shut down plants , sacked workers , and raised money by selling back to suppliers electricity for uranium processing bought under long-term contracts .
despite the exclusive russian contract and the duties on its european competitors , usec 's share price has halved to about $ 7 since floatation .
european threat usec could soon also face domestic competition from the urenco , which reputedly produces the cheapest enriched uranium in the world , has the newest technology and is expanding capacity .
it is part of a consortium that plans to build a $ 1.1bn uranium processing plant in the us , the first since the 1980s , which would break usec 's monopoly .
the output from the plant , which could be operational by 2007 , would not be subject to duties and be significantly cheaper to operate .

earlier this year the us department of commerce imposed tariffs on european producers of low enriched uranium -lrb- leu -rrb- , claiming they received unfair state subsidises . "
it has an impact on us of several million dollars a year " mark elliot , urenco the commission , which values the leu exports at $ 500m -lrb- £ 320m -rrb- - or one third of the us market - has condemned the duties as " illegal " .
an eu spokeswoman told bbc news online it had failed to reach an " amicable " solution after months of talks with the us and would now seek to refer the case to the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- .
" we are not going to sit and wait , " the spokeswoman for trade commissioner pascal lamy said .
" we will send our final consultation documentation to our member states in the next couple of weeks and do not expect any obstacles " .
the dispute over uranium the follows spats between the us and europe over corporate tax breaks and trade in steel , bananas and beef .
leu is used to fuel in nuclear power plants and is not weapons grade material .
nuclear refinement two years ago , the only us enricher of uranium , the recently privatised us enrichment corporation -lrb- usec -rrb- , lodged a complaint against the french government 's eurodif and urenco , a uk-dutch-german government consortium .
an investigation last year by the international trade commission -lrb- itc -rrb- , the us body which recommends the imposition of duties , reported that " subsidised " european leu was harming the domestic industry .
as a result , eurodif now pays an extra 34 % duty , and urenco 2.23 % , on exports to the us .
the european commission estimates usec will receive about $ 100m in extra annual income from the duties .
" it has an impact on us of several million dollars a year , but its not crippling , " mark elliot , general manager of marketing at urenco , told bbc news online .
" they accused urenco of receiving state subsidies in the 70s and 80s and the itc established that we were innocent of most accusations , but had not fully repaid a small number of subsidies according to their rules . "
review due urenco , which is part owned by british nuclear fuels , disputes the findings and plans to appeal to the us court of international trade . "
we 're not contemplating a counter claim against usec , but they themselves have had government subsidies in the past " mark elliot , urenco the itc also found state-owned power company electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- had bought eurodif 's uranium at about 13 % above market prices , and that the proceeds were then used to bankroll the sale the metal in the us at 19.5 % below usec prices .
the us department of commerce is expected to review the case in january .
russian connection usec has a monopoly on uranium enrichment in the us and is the world 's leading supplier of fuel to nuclear power plants .
the company is also the only middleman for recycling weapons grade material from decommissioned russian nuclear warheads .
the us government hopes the deal will keep the material out of terrorist hands .
but brussels believes usec 's state-conferred monopoly over the russian reprocessing should have been considered by the itc in its decision .
the duties have been hailed by usec as being in the " long term interests " of both the company and us national security .

" it is a tough challenge , especially when one looks at the programming budgets of itv and channel 4 but we like tough challenges . "
the channel is shedding its reputation as merely the home of obscure football and erotic films , with bought in shows like law and order , crime scene investigation and the shield , as well as arts programming winning plaudits .
a channel 4 spokesman told bbc news online : " we had a particularly bad week , but it is a blip .

if there is a cluster of them , the gis teams can often track down a source of infection quickly and get rid of it .
" if you see that the larvae are breeding in stagnant waters and then people are dying of malaria , then definitely in spatial terms it tells you that the cause of that death is the stagnant waters breeding mosquitoes , " said mr tuffour .
leapfrog ahead you need a powerful computer to get the most out of a gis system , something which could be a problem in developing countries .

breeding ground " it can be used in health , " said anthony tuffour from ghana , who has just completed his masters degree at university college in london .
" i was talking to a friend of mine who is doing a project in ghana and he is using gis to map out malaria incidences in ghana and then tries to establish the cause-effect . "
" we have definitely leapfrogged and we 're into much more recent technology " s sridhar , magnasoft the project maps out where malarial cases appear .
if there is a cluster of them , the gis teams can often track down a source of infection quickly and get rid of it .
" if you see that the larvae are breeding in stagnant waters and then people are dying of malaria , then definitely in spatial terms it tells you that the cause of that death is the stagnant waters breeding mosquitoes , " said mr tuffour .
leapfrog ahead you need a powerful computer to get the most out of a gis system , something which could be a problem in developing countries .
but s sridhar , managing director of indian gis company magnasoft , argues that developing countries may even have an advantage when it comes to the latest technologies .
" we were very slow in getting into telephony .
it took a long time to get a telephone line , " he said .
" a few years ago it used to take hours to walk to a telephone line .
today , you 've got mobile devices in almost every village in india .
" thanks to liberalisation and the opening up of the indian economy , a lot of international telephone technologies have come , " he explained .
" in a way we have definitely leapfrogged and we 're into much more recent technology .
it 's the same in the computer industry . "
you can hear more about the use of gis on the bbc world service programme go digital .

in his keynote speech , the prime minister said labour was " best at its boldest - and so far we 've made a good start , but we 've not been bold enough " .
in a direct message to union leaders and labour activists unhappy about the use of private cash in public services , he declared that it was time to move on from " old principles " .
tony blair defended his relationship with the united states and restated his tough stance on iraq .
mr blair described events in the middle east as " ugly and wrong " and called for a revival of negotiations leading to a viable palestinian state based on the boundaries of 1967 but warned that israel must be free of terrorism .
were you convinced by the prime minister 's speech ?
is the government winning over the doubters ?
has tony blair increased his standing within the party ?
you put your questions to the northern ireland secretary john reid in an interactive forum .
transcript newshost : mark , uk : why is britain not backing the new deal to admit weapons inspectors ?
john reid : well we are backing it .
our aim is to stop saddam having any chance of using weapons of mass destruction .
now when the weapons inspectors went in last time , every conceivable object was put in their way and they were then expelled .
and indeed up until july of this year , the united nations were trying to negotiate to get them back in .
so we have said that the weapons inspectors should go back in but they must be free to go anywhere , anytime and anyone .
now if that is done , you 've a chance of actually getting at these weapons of mass destruction .
but it must be on that basis .
newshost : and you see the current situation as saddam still trying to confuse the issue and to wriggle ?
john reid : well he 's got a history of prevarication and a history of trying to delay .
so we 've got to make sure that it 's absolutely clear that they can go anywhere at anytime without any notice and send anyone and also that there is no prevarication either when they get there or before they get there .
newshost : chris davies , usa / uk : do you believe that if the us and uk proceed with military action against iraq without it being approved by the un security council ; that this will significantly reduce the un 's ability to deal with future problems , possibly relegating it to no more than another league of nations ?
john reid : well i think the biggest threat to the united nation 's future , legitimacy and authority is if it fails to act on this one .
that 's why we 've put so much effort into making sure that every member of the security council is on board and that 's the discussions that are going on at present .
to fail to act on this would not only be to leave the threat of saddam hussein , but it would be to completely undermine the legitimacy and authority of the united nations .
newshost : do you see the parallel with the league of nations which of course fell apart at the time of the second war ?
john reid : the league of nations fell apart because of its unwillingness to act .
the united nations was set up by charter in order to make sure that the same mistake was never made again as was made with hitler .
by failing to act early , it took 50 million deaths and 6 years of war to stop hitler and that is why the united nations was set up .
so never again would they allow someone who had dictatorial tendencies and such an armoury to go unchecked .
that is why the united nation 's authority is now at stake .
newshost : pd , uk : how does the labour party propose that the world community should address " regime change " in iraq ?
john reid : it is not our primary aim .
our primary aim is to get rid of the threat from the weapons of mass destruction .
if by some unlikely chance , saddam , even at this late stage , was to honestly get rid of those weapons and we could all see that that had happened and let 's the inspectors unfettered and free - fine .
however , it is unlikely that he will do that because all of his history suggests he wo n't .
secondly if as a result of getting rid of the weapons of mass destruction we get rid of saddam , there is no question in my mind or anyone else 's mind that it would be an undoubted boon for the people of iraq .
newshost : no fears that it would be just out of the frying pan into the fire when a following regime may be just as bad as saddam ?
john reid : it is difficult to imagine any regime in the world which is as brutal , dictatorial and dangerous as saddam hussein , which is precisely why because it 's such a unique threat that the united nations has to take very , very firm action indeed .
newshost : steven , uk : the tone of tony blair 's speech seems to hide the agenda that " new labour " wants a divorce from trade union .
are we seeing the birth or american style politics , dominated by cronyism and big businesses ?
john reid : no it is natural that the relationship between the labour party and the trade unions should change over the decades and over the century because the world is changed around us .
one hundred years ago , when labour was formed , the working people of this country had no extra money - they were only producers .
therefore it was quite sensible then to have a predominate role of the trade unions in the labour party because they are the producers organised .
nowadays , 75 % of working families are consumers .
they have much more money - they want more choice , more diversity .
so although we now share common aims with the trade union movement on social justice and so on , they have to look after the interests of workers as producers in the workplace and so on , but we have to govern for the whole country .
we ca n't be held liable or determined by only one group in society .
newshost : do you think the unions are now , after tony blair 's speech , more or less on board ?
john reid : well i hope they have learned from the debates we 've had not only that we intend to go ahead but why because it 's in their interest .
we are spending a great deal of public money on the services the public want , but we 're spending also in addition to that about 25 % private money has been brought in .
what does that mean ?
it means a huge amount of money has put in to improve public services and if they do n't operate along with us - the representatives of the workers - to reform at the same time as we invest to make sure the service is as good as anything you can get elsewhere , then in a few year 's time people will say , the health service ca n't give us the service we want .
we 've put in enormous amounts of money but it 's incapable of change .
newshost : tony blair clearly believes that only pfi can help him fulfil those election promises .
the unions clearly do n't accept that - or some of the unions do n't accept that argument .
john reid : it 's not only private finance .
let me give you a couple of figures .
when we came to power , £ 22 billion was being invested in capital investment every year .
under labour by the end of 2002/03 , it will be £ 38 billion - a huge increase .
and of that increase this year , 85 % is actually public money - taxpayers ' money .
so it 's not as if we 're not investing .
i could understand it if the unions were saying we 're not putting any public money in - we 're putting huge amounts in and on top of that we 're saying let 's get more money in .
why ?
because if it means that another 100,000 people in pain can get treated , that what 's doing it .
how do you explain to someone whose mother needs a hip operation and is in constant pain that she ca n't have it because some of the trade unions objected to where the money comes from ?
we 're not going to do that .
newshost : anthony hook , dover , kent : before the general election the government said it had no plans to increase taxes and spending on public services .
why did you so quickly cave in and do something similar to what the liberal democrats were calling for ?
does it show the lib dems are thinking ahead of labour ?
john reid : before the ' 97 election , we did n't have any plans to increase taxation and we did n't quickly change our minds .
it was nearly five and half years later when we added 1 penny and in between times , what happened to change circumstances ?
well the world economy went into recession and despite the fact that we were in a position where we were much stronger than any other economy to resist it , nevertheless it did affect britain , as anywhere else .
we found that in order to meet the plans we wanted , because of changed circumstances , we should put a penny on the general taxation that we take from people .
now , we made the argument , we made the choice .
it was five and half years after we had first made the pledge and i think people can understand that .
newshost : do you think that it seemed before that it seemed that no political party could make that sort of argument - that taxes should go up to fund public services ?
and of course it was n't tested in a general election .
do you think that argument can now win elections ?
do you think the public is ready to accept a tax-raising for investment platform ?
john reid : i think it is true that the sense of values and priorities of people have changed - partly because we have been arguing that , partly because they are now convinced that we are not spendthrifts .
we 're running the strongest economy for almost half a century .
however , having said that , no one should think for a moment that you can willy-nilly increase taxation without having a terrible effect on the economy as well as on the people who vote for you .
so we 've no intentions to go back to the days of tax and spend .
newshost : you 're not going to do it again - between here and the next election ?
john reid : i never jump in ahead of the chancellor who is a very powerful man and does n't like any of us doing that .
but certainly there 's no return to the days of tax and spend .
we have used all of the money incidentally that we raised for investment - not to keep things going but to invest in the future .
newshost : alan hall , stockport , england : john prescott said that " an independent review " is just some fancy words for a freeze , -lrb- in relation to pfi -rrb- .
does this also apply to the fire fighters ' independent review ?
john reid : i think they were talking about two different circumstances .
let me say first of all , this idea that we 've had a huge outbreak of strikes is n't entirely true .
we 've lost this year , 350,000 man-days through strikes .
with the tories you were losing 27 million man-days when they were in power .
so we should n't all go into a state of panic over this .
the trade unions know that we have now created 1.5 million new jobs and we 've brought in a minimum income for the first time in britain 's history .
we 've given legal rights to part-time workers , the legal right to be a member of a trade union .
they know that we 've been fair to trade unions .
but the fire-fighters feel that they are due more than the going rate and because it has knock-on effects - because if one group gets a huge increase , without proving they 're an exceptional case , everyone else claims it .
so because of that , we 've said let an independent person look at this .
my final comment is , it is n't true there have n't been any reviews of the private finance initiative .
there have been scores of them from the individual decisions that are initially - which is an economic review - through the national audit office , through all the independent reviews and most of them show we 're getting good value for money .
newshost : but does n't that depend on how you look at the figures and that in the short-term it looks as though it 's a good form of investment , but in the long-term these pfi programmes actually in the long run cost a great deal more ?
john reid : no they do n't .
people might be interested in how a minister makes a decision - i 've made some of them .
at the ministry of defence i had about seven , i think , and i put three of them out to private finance and kept four of them in the public sector .
what we do is we draw up the cost over 25 years - not this year , but 25 years - because if you build out of public money , you 've got to maintain for 25 and more years .
the history of the public money is they are normally hugely over budget , normally hugely late and normally have terribly maintenance costs which means that they run down the hospitals and the schools are n't kept in condition .
so we take the cost of it for 25 years - the public sector , then the private sector - we compare them and whatever is the best value we go that route .
