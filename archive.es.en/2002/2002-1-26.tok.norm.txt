he is reported to have wanted her to return to turkey and marry a kurdish man in an arranged marriage , which fadime refused to do .

the call - made after a cabinet meeting - followed a day of renewed confrontation on friday between israel and the palestinians .
israeli warplanes attacked targets in palestinian-controlled areas in apparent retaliation for a suicide bomb attack in tel aviv , which left at least 22 bystanders injured as well as killing the bomber himself .
the people of israel can not tolerate these kind of activities continuing israeli spokesman dore gold there has also been renewed pressure from the united states and israel for mr arafat to take tougher action against militants .
the palestinian cabinet urged militant groups to " maintain a comprehensive ceasefire and stop operations against israel and the israelis " .
" these operations do not serve our national cause at all " , it said .
the palestinian authority also called for the return to the region of us envoy anthony zinni , who has been trying to broker a halt to the violence .
warplanes sent in israel blamed the palestinian authority for the suicide bombing in tel aviv and sent f-16 jets to bomb palestinian security targets in gaza city and the west bank town of tulkarm .
the attack on gaza targeted the ansar security compound near the seaside headquarters of mr arafat , who is currently besieged by the israeli army at his west bank headquarters in ramallah .
the strike on tulkarm levelled a building close to the governor 's residence that had already been largely flattened earlier in the week .
islamic jihad recently announced it would resume attacks on israel at least two people were wounded in the attacks .
the palestinian authority has described the israeli air raids as a serious escalation .
the earlier blast in tel aviv happened in a shopping area near the disused central bus station , which is usually crowded before the sabbath .
the militant islamic jihad group said it carried out the attack , identifying the bomber as 18-year-old safwat khalil .
bush ' disappointed ' both the united states and israel have intensified pressure on mr arafat to curb palestinian militants .
arafat has been confined to ramallah since december president bush said he was " disappointed " with the palestinian leader and that mr arafat had to make a " full effort to rout out terror " .
the american president made his remarks as senior members of his administration were contemplating a possible change of policy towards the palestinian authority .
a senior palestinian official , marwan barghouti , said american policies were unfair and had led to bloodshed in the middle east .
palestinian leaders said the israelis had been given a green light to launch air strikes by an apparent toughening of us policy against the palestinians . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's caroline wyatt " it was a swift response " president george w bush " i am disappointed in yasser arafat " key stories palestinian disarray backing the bombers us demands distant hope arafat 's successors ?

the call - made after a cabinet meeting - followed a day of renewed confrontation on friday between israel and the palestinians .
israeli warplanes attacked targets in palestinian-controlled areas in apparent retaliation for a suicide bomb attack in tel aviv , which left at least 22 bystanders injured as well as killing the bomber himself .
the people of israel can not tolerate these kind of activities continuing israeli spokesman dore gold there has also been renewed pressure from the united states and israel for mr arafat to take tougher action against militants .
the palestinian cabinet urged militant groups to " maintain a comprehensive ceasefire and stop operations against israel and the israelis " .
" these operations do not serve our national cause at all " , it said .
the palestinian authority also called for the return to the region of us envoy anthony zinni , who has been trying to broker a halt to the violence .
warplanes sent in israel blamed the palestinian authority for the suicide bombing in tel aviv and sent f-16 jets to bomb palestinian security targets in gaza city and the west bank town of tulkarm .
the attack on gaza targeted the ansar security compound near the seaside headquarters of mr arafat , who is currently besieged by the israeli army at his west bank headquarters in ramallah .
the strike on tulkarm levelled a building close to the governor 's residence that had already been largely flattened earlier in the week .
at least two people were wounded in the attacks .
the palestinian authority has described the israeli air raids as a serious escalation .
the earlier blast in tel aviv happened in a shopping area near the disused central bus station , which is usually crowded before the sabbath .
the militant islamic jihad group said it carried out the attack , identifying the bomber as 18-year-old safwat khalil .
bush ' disappointed ' both the united states and israel have intensified pressure on mr arafat to curb palestinian militants .
president bush said he was " disappointed " with the palestinian leader and that mr arafat had to make a " full effort to rout out terror " .
the american president made his remarks as senior members of his administration were contemplating a possible change of policy towards the palestinian authority .
a senior palestinian official , marwan barghouti , said american policies were unfair and had led to bloodshed in the middle east .
palestinian leaders said the israelis had been given a green light to launch air strikes by an apparent toughening of us policy against the palestinians .

our emotions are crushed .
most people are mentally sick asylum seeker five people are refusing food and water at the curtin detention centre , 1,300 km -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- north of perth , in sympathy with protests at woomera and maribyrnong camps , said a spokesman for the immigration department .
another five from curtin , four iranians and an afghan , were admitted to hospital after swallowing antiseptic .
a man from woomera is receiving treatment after apparently failing to escape over the centre 's perimeter fence .
the man became caught in barbed wire as about 200 refugees , some armed with iron bars , climbed onto roofs and began chanting " visa , visa " .
a camp guard was injured by a rock apparently thrown by a protester .
phil mercer , the bbc 's correspondent at woomera , says there are reports of detainees vomiting blood and suffering from kidney complaints .
activists have warned the australian government that it is only a matter of time before a detainee dies .
no deal the government has lifted a freeze on the processing of claims from afghan detainees in a move aimed at easing the growing tension inside woomera - a remote camp in the southern australian desert .
mr ahmadi : " our emotions are crushed " the authorities also released about 20 woomera detainees after their refugee claims were accepted .
but a negotiating team returned from woomera to tell the government that the moves did not go far enough .
inmates want to be moved to another facility that is less isolated , and where conditions are better .
babak ahmadi , a geologist from iran who has been released after 20 months in woomera , asked : " how can a person sit in detention in the middle of the desert for two years ?
" our emotions are crushed .
most people are mentally sick . "
un pressure but australian prime minister john howard , re-elected last year after acting firmly against groups of mainly afghan asylum-seekers , said his government 's tough immigration policies will not be watered down by continued unrest at woomera .
two hundred and eleven people are now on hunger strike at the centre , 45 of whom have sewn their mouths shut .
thirty-seven of the total are children .
at least 15 of the protesters have tried to hang themselves ; others have swallowed shampoo and painkillers .
twenty-one detainees are also refusing food and drink at maribyrnong in melbourne .
some detainees have swallowed shampoo and painkillers the un refugee agency repeated on friday that it is strongly opposed to australia 's detention of refugees .
" this whole mess ... illustrates the dangers and pitfalls of detaining asylum seekers , " said kris janowski , a spokesman for the un 's high commissioner for refugees .
according to the sydney morning herald , mounting national outrage at the protest has led to the first cracks in the country 's bipartisan approach to asylum seekers .
it says the leader of the labor opposition party will say in a speech to mark australia day on saturday : " it is just plain wrong to hold innocent children behind razor wire " .
detainees in the six camps spread around the country are locked up for months , even years , while the authorities decide whether they are genuine refugees .
according to mr howard , releasing them to live in the community would only encourage more asylum seekers to come to australia .
every year australia takes in 10,000 refugees who are formally resettled by the united nations and another 50,000 permanent migrants , mainly from britain and new zealand . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's michael peschardt " neither side is prepared to back down " talking point seeking asylum is the australian government 's action justified ?
