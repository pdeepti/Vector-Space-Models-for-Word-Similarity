schröder announced on tuesday evening he would reintroduce the issue in the social democrat-green party-led parliament .
trade unions , however , reaffirmed their objections to longer shopping hours .
currently , retail businesses must close at 4 p.m. on saturday and 8 p.m. on weekdays .
on some occasions , though , including the christmas shopping season , shops are allowed to stay open later on saturdays .
they can open on sundays only four days each year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.12.2002 u.s. economy a bumpy ride for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all german companies are having as much success in the u.s. as daimlerchrysler a study released earlier this week has little praise for german companies operating in the united states .
it accuses them of " hibernating " as the economic crisis deepened and americans began laying off staff . according to the survey taken by the german american chamber of commerce and the consulting firm droege and company , 67 percent of german companies operating in the u.s. were ill-prepared for the economic doldrums that have stifled the business climate there .
its findings mark a dramatically negative psychological shift among managers of german companies .
in a poll conducted in the summer , 80 percent said they were optimistic the economy would soon turn around .
but today , only 49 percent remain optimistic .
the rest see dark economic clouds ahead and a slower-than-hoped-for recovery period .
sixty-three percent of the 439 german companies surveyed in the manufacturing and services sector have been hard hit by weak economic growth in the u.s. firms have been hardest struck on the west coast and in the southeast , where troubles in the information technology and telecommunications sectors have been concentrated .
pulling up the stakes more than half of the companies polled reported at least 20 percent losses in revenues and earnings .
indeed , 9 percent were so badly affected that they decided to pull up their stakes and head back to germany - a figure the report described as " disturbingly high . "
the study points to some important differences between american and german business styles that could have played a role .
generally , german companies tend to react less quickly to economic crises .
" german companies are slower in doing layoffs or significant cost-cutting initiatives , " christoph kühne , a principal at droege who worked on the survey , told dw-world .
rather than reevaluating business strategies , organizational structures or staffing levels , many have taken the approach of trying to weather out the crisis .
but slowly , the report found , german companies are waking up from their winter sleep .
" they 're being less reserved about these measures , but they 're not laying off in the same massive numbers we 've seen at u.s. companies , " he said .
kühne also attributes the split in styles between the continents to differing management and corporate structures .
" one of the reasons is that german management boards that are based in germany often want to be involved in decision-making for the u.s. marketplace and there 's a time delay , " said kühne .
" it also makes it tougher for companies to operate if they mimick german business behavior , " he says , noting that greater speed and aggressiveness are needed for german companies to compete successfully in the american marketplace .
u.s. opportunities still to be found belt-tightening aside , kühne says there is plenty of upside potential for german companies doing business in doldrums-stricken america .
indeed , there are more than 1,800 german companies with subsidiaries or operations in the u.s. together , they generate annual revenue of $ 500 billion and employ more than a million people .
the weak u.s. economy creates new opportunities for global players like daimlerchrysler , porsche or siemens , which have the opportunity to acquire undervalued companies or to expand markets for their products at a time when their american counterparts are struggling and have shrunken marketing budgets .
among the " winners " cited by the report is porsche , which in addition to improving its operations , has also created a sport utility vehicle unit in order to better exploit the u.s. market .
" if you have a strong product or service , then it makes sense to try to gain market share and gain new customers while your american competitor is in a weakened state , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still scares off investors , say u.s. firms finance minister eichel 's much-heralded tax reform has just come into effect but germany will still be hard pressed to sell itself as a prime location for business according to tax experts at the us chamber of commerce .

it accuses them of " hibernating " as the economic crisis deepened and americans began laying off staff . according to the survey taken by the german american chamber of commerce and the consulting firm droege and company , 67 percent of german companies operating in the u.s. were ill-prepared for the economic doldrums that have stifled the business climate there .
its findings mark a dramatically negative psychological shift among managers of german companies .
in a poll conducted in the summer , 80 percent said they were optimistic the economy would soon turn around .
but today , only 49 percent remain optimistic .
the rest see dark economic clouds ahead and a slower-than-hoped-for recovery period .

the study points to some important differences between american and german business styles that could have played a role .
generally , german companies tend to react less quickly to economic crises .
" german companies are slower in doing layoffs or significant cost-cutting initiatives , " christoph kühne , a principal at droege who worked on the survey , told dw-world .

" they 're being less reserved about these measures , but they 're not laying off in the same massive numbers we 've seen at u.s. companies , " he said .
kühne also attributes the split in styles between the continents to differing management and corporate structures .
" one of the reasons is that german management boards that are based in germany often want to be involved in decision-making for the u.s. marketplace and there 's a time delay , " said kühne .
" it also makes it tougher for companies to operate if they mimick german business behavior , " he says , noting that greater speed and aggressiveness are needed for german companies to compete successfully in the american marketplace .
u.s. opportunities still to be found belt-tightening aside , kühne says there is plenty of upside potential for german companies doing business in doldrums-stricken america .

germany 's chancellor was under pressure to deliver in parliament on wednesday .
however more bad economic news put a damper on his performance . it was billed as his blood , sweat and tears speech , a wake-up call to germany and its people .
and observers say chancellor gerhard schröder 's performance on wednesday during the parliamentary budget debate for 2003 was a return to form and a much-needed boost for his party , the social democrats .
in the face of a seemingly never-ending stream of gloomy economic news , accusations by the conservative opposition of deceiving the electorate about the state of the economy , and plummeting popularity rates , schröder chose to keep a low profile .
schröder attacks earlier this week , under pressure from detractors within his own party to confront the public with a coherent stance on germany 's economic problems , schröder announced that he would use the budgetary debate in parliament to address the issues .
following the opening speech by michael glos , the parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union , who accused the government of complete failure with its economic policies , schröder launched a series of fierce attacks on the opposition .
he said the opposition conservatives were unsurpassable in their lack of content .
there was no sign , he said , of viable proposals to solve the country 's problems .
he talked of personal defamation and called on angela merkel , leader of the christian democratic union , to " call back the political agitators within her ranks . "
more reforms schröder conceded that the economic situation in germany was worse than expected at the beginning of the year .
" there is no doubt that we are experiencing economic problems , " he said , but stressed that the downturn was due to the global economic climate .
backing his finance minister hans eichel , who on tuesday announced further cuts into the welfare system , schröder said further social reforms were needed , especially in the pension system , where contribution rates for employers and employees are set to rise to 19.5 percent from 19.1 percent .
schröder also called on the opposition to work constructively with his government .
his coalition of social democrats and greens face a conservative majority in the upper legislative chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , where cdu and csu have the power to block the passage of labor market reforms proposed by the government .
lack of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel cdu leader merkel accused schröder of lacking in leadership .
his policies , she said , were damaging germany 's prospects of an economic recovery .
" you are not shaping policies , " she said .
she said it was representative of schröder 's stance that he did not mention the latest rise in german unemployment .
more gloom indeed , the data released by the federal labor office paints a gloomy picture .
it shows that the number of jobless rose to its highest november level in five years climbing above the psychologically sensitive 4-million mark .
the seasonally adjusted figure rose by 35,000 from october to 4.161 million disastrous opinion poll figures are piling on the pressure even more .
the latest survey shows that the social democrats would only gain 27 percent of the vote if elections were held this sunday , a loss of 11.5 percentage points compared to september 's general election .
the union parties meanwhile would win 50 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany on the brink of recession germany 's most important business climate index continued to fall last month .

germany 's chancellor was under pressure to deliver in parliament on wednesday .
however more bad economic news put a damper on his performance . it was billed as his blood , sweat and tears speech , a wake-up call to germany and its people .
and observers say chancellor gerhard schröder 's performance on wednesday during the parliamentary budget debate for 2003 was a return to form and a much-needed boost for his party , the social democrats .
in the face of a seemingly never-ending stream of gloomy economic news , accusations by the conservative opposition of deceiving the electorate about the state of the economy , and plummeting popularity rates , schröder chose to keep a low profile .
schröder attacks earlier this week , under pressure from detractors within his own party to confront the public with a coherent stance on germany 's economic problems , schröder announced that he would use the budgetary debate in parliament to address the issues .
following the opening speech by michael glos , the parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union , who accused the government of complete failure with its economic policies , schröder launched a series of fierce attacks on the opposition .
he said the opposition conservatives were unsurpassable in their lack of content .
there was no sign , he said , of viable proposals to solve the country 's problems .
he talked of personal defamation and called on angela merkel , leader of the christian democratic union , to " call back the political agitators within her ranks . "

schröder announced on tuesday evening he would reintroduce the issue in the social democrat-green party-led parliament .
trade unions , however , reaffirmed their objections to longer shopping hours .
currently , retail businesses must close at 4 p.m. on saturday and 8 p.m. on weekdays .
on some occasions , though , including the christmas shopping season , shops are allowed to stay open later on saturdays .
they can open on sundays only four days each year .

it accuses them of " hibernating " as the economic crisis deepened and americans began laying off staff . according to the survey taken by the german american chamber of commerce and the consulting firm droege and company , 67 percent of german companies operating in the u.s. were ill-prepared for the economic doldrums that have stifled the business climate there .
its findings mark a dramatically negative psychological shift among managers of german companies .
in a poll conducted in the summer , 80 percent said they were optimistic the economy would soon turn around .
but today , only 49 percent remain optimistic .
the rest see dark economic clouds ahead and a slower-than-hoped-for recovery period .
sixty-three percent of the 439 german companies surveyed in the manufacturing and services sector have been hard hit by weak economic growth in the u.s. firms have been hardest struck on the west coast and in the southeast , where troubles in the information technology and telecommunications sectors have been concentrated .
pulling up the stakes more than half of the companies polled reported at least 20 percent losses in revenues and earnings .
indeed , 9 percent were so badly affected that they decided to pull up their stakes and head back to germany - a figure the report described as " disturbingly high . "
the study points to some important differences between american and german business styles that could have played a role .
generally , german companies tend to react less quickly to economic crises .
" german companies are slower in doing layoffs or significant cost-cutting initiatives , " christoph kühne , a principal at droege who worked on the survey , told dw-world .
rather than reevaluating business strategies , organizational structures or staffing levels , many have taken the approach of trying to weather out the crisis .
but slowly , the report found , german companies are waking up from their winter sleep .
" they 're being less reserved about these measures , but they 're not laying off in the same massive numbers we 've seen at u.s. companies , " he said .
kühne also attributes the split in styles between the continents to differing management and corporate structures .
" one of the reasons is that german management boards that are based in germany often want to be involved in decision-making for the u.s. marketplace and there 's a time delay , " said kühne .
" it also makes it tougher for companies to operate if they mimick german business behavior , " he says , noting that greater speed and aggressiveness are needed for german companies to compete successfully in the american marketplace .
u.s. opportunities still to be found belt-tightening aside , kühne says there is plenty of upside potential for german companies doing business in doldrums-stricken america .
indeed , there are more than 1,800 german companies with subsidiaries or operations in the u.s. together , they generate annual revenue of $ 500 billion and employ more than a million people .
the weak u.s. economy creates new opportunities for global players like daimlerchrysler , porsche or siemens , which have the opportunity to acquire undervalued companies or to expand markets for their products at a time when their american counterparts are struggling and have shrunken marketing budgets .
among the " winners " cited by the report is porsche , which in addition to improving its operations , has also created a sport utility vehicle unit in order to better exploit the u.s. market .
" if you have a strong product or service , then it makes sense to try to gain market share and gain new customers while your american competitor is in a weakened state , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still scares off investors , say u.s. firms finance minister eichel 's much-heralded tax reform has just come into effect but germany will still be hard pressed to sell itself as a prime location for business according to tax experts at the us chamber of commerce .

germany 's chancellor was under pressure to deliver in parliament on wednesday .
however more bad economic news put a damper on his performance . it was billed as his blood , sweat and tears speech , a wake-up call to germany and its people .
and observers say chancellor gerhard schröder 's performance on wednesday during the parliamentary budget debate for 2003 was a return to form and a much-needed boost for his party , the social democrats .
in the face of a seemingly never-ending stream of gloomy economic news , accusations by the conservative opposition of deceiving the electorate about the state of the economy , and plummeting popularity rates , schröder chose to keep a low profile .
schröder attacks earlier this week , under pressure from detractors within his own party to confront the public with a coherent stance on germany 's economic problems , schröder announced that he would use the budgetary debate in parliament to address the issues .
following the opening speech by michael glos , the parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union , who accused the government of complete failure with its economic policies , schröder launched a series of fierce attacks on the opposition .
he said the opposition conservatives were unsurpassable in their lack of content .
there was no sign , he said , of viable proposals to solve the country 's problems .
he talked of personal defamation and called on angela merkel , leader of the christian democratic union , to " call back the political agitators within her ranks . "
more reforms schröder conceded that the economic situation in germany was worse than expected at the beginning of the year .
" there is no doubt that we are experiencing economic problems , " he said , but stressed that the downturn was due to the global economic climate .
backing his finance minister hans eichel , who on tuesday announced further cuts into the welfare system , schröder said further social reforms were needed , especially in the pension system , where contribution rates for employers and employees are set to rise to 19.5 percent from 19.1 percent .
schröder also called on the opposition to work constructively with his government .
his coalition of social democrats and greens face a conservative majority in the upper legislative chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , where cdu and csu have the power to block the passage of labor market reforms proposed by the government .
lack of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel cdu leader merkel accused schröder of lacking in leadership .
his policies , she said , were damaging germany 's prospects of an economic recovery .
" you are not shaping policies , " she said .
she said it was representative of schröder 's stance that he did not mention the latest rise in german unemployment .

it accuses them of " hibernating " as the economic crisis deepened and americans began laying off staff . according to the survey taken by the german american chamber of commerce and the consulting firm droege and company , 67 percent of german companies operating in the u.s. were ill-prepared for the economic doldrums that have stifled the business climate there .
its findings mark a dramatically negative psychological shift among managers of german companies .
in a poll conducted in the summer , 80 percent said they were optimistic the economy would soon turn around .
but today , only 49 percent remain optimistic .
the rest see dark economic clouds ahead and a slower-than-hoped-for recovery period .
sixty-three percent of the 439 german companies surveyed in the manufacturing and services sector have been hard hit by weak economic growth in the u.s. firms have been hardest struck on the west coast and in the southeast , where troubles in the information technology and telecommunications sectors have been concentrated .
pulling up the stakes more than half of the companies polled reported at least 20 percent losses in revenues and earnings .
indeed , 9 percent were so badly affected that they decided to pull up their stakes and head back to germany - a figure the report described as " disturbingly high . "
the study points to some important differences between american and german business styles that could have played a role .
generally , german companies tend to react less quickly to economic crises .
" german companies are slower in doing layoffs or significant cost-cutting initiatives , " christoph kühne , a principal at droege who worked on the survey , told dw-world .
rather than reevaluating business strategies , organizational structures or staffing levels , many have taken the approach of trying to weather out the crisis .
but slowly , the report found , german companies are waking up from their winter sleep .
" they 're being less reserved about these measures , but they 're not laying off in the same massive numbers we 've seen at u.s. companies , " he said .
kühne also attributes the split in styles between the continents to differing management and corporate structures .
" one of the reasons is that german management boards that are based in germany often want to be involved in decision-making for the u.s. marketplace and there 's a time delay , " said kühne .
" it also makes it tougher for companies to operate if they mimick german business behavior , " he says , noting that greater speed and aggressiveness are needed for german companies to compete successfully in the american marketplace .
u.s. opportunities still to be found belt-tightening aside , kühne says there is plenty of upside potential for german companies doing business in doldrums-stricken america .
indeed , there are more than 1,800 german companies with subsidiaries or operations in the u.s. together , they generate annual revenue of $ 500 billion and employ more than a million people .
the weak u.s. economy creates new opportunities for global players like daimlerchrysler , porsche or siemens , which have the opportunity to acquire undervalued companies or to expand markets for their products at a time when their american counterparts are struggling and have shrunken marketing budgets .
among the " winners " cited by the report is porsche , which in addition to improving its operations , has also created a sport utility vehicle unit in order to better exploit the u.s. market .

germany 's chancellor was under pressure to deliver in parliament on wednesday .
however more bad economic news put a damper on his performance . it was billed as his blood , sweat and tears speech , a wake-up call to germany and its people .
and observers say chancellor gerhard schröder 's performance on wednesday during the parliamentary budget debate for 2003 was a return to form and a much-needed boost for his party , the social democrats .
in the face of a seemingly never-ending stream of gloomy economic news , accusations by the conservative opposition of deceiving the electorate about the state of the economy , and plummeting popularity rates , schröder chose to keep a low profile .
schröder attacks earlier this week , under pressure from detractors within his own party to confront the public with a coherent stance on germany 's economic problems , schröder announced that he would use the budgetary debate in parliament to address the issues .
following the opening speech by michael glos , the parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union , who accused the government of complete failure with its economic policies , schröder launched a series of fierce attacks on the opposition .
he said the opposition conservatives were unsurpassable in their lack of content .
there was no sign , he said , of viable proposals to solve the country 's problems .
he talked of personal defamation and called on angela merkel , leader of the christian democratic union , to " call back the political agitators within her ranks . "
more reforms schröder conceded that the economic situation in germany was worse than expected at the beginning of the year .
" there is no doubt that we are experiencing economic problems , " he said , but stressed that the downturn was due to the global economic climate .
backing his finance minister hans eichel , who on tuesday announced further cuts into the welfare system , schröder said further social reforms were needed , especially in the pension system , where contribution rates for employers and employees are set to rise to 19.5 percent from 19.1 percent .
schröder also called on the opposition to work constructively with his government .
his coalition of social democrats and greens face a conservative majority in the upper legislative chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , where cdu and csu have the power to block the passage of labor market reforms proposed by the government .
lack of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel cdu leader merkel accused schröder of lacking in leadership .
his policies , she said , were damaging germany 's prospects of an economic recovery .
" you are not shaping policies , " she said .
she said it was representative of schröder 's stance that he did not mention the latest rise in german unemployment .
more gloom indeed , the data released by the federal labor office paints a gloomy picture .
it shows that the number of jobless rose to its highest november level in five years climbing above the psychologically sensitive 4-million mark .
the seasonally adjusted figure rose by 35,000 from october to 4.161 million disastrous opinion poll figures are piling on the pressure even more .
the latest survey shows that the social democrats would only gain 27 percent of the vote if elections were held this sunday , a loss of 11.5 percentage points compared to september 's general election .

following the opening speech by michael glos , the parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union , who accused the government of complete failure with its economic policies , schröder launched a series of fierce attacks on the opposition .
he said the opposition conservatives were unsurpassable in their lack of content .
there was no sign , he said , of viable proposals to solve the country 's problems .

schröder also called on the opposition to work constructively with his government .

it accuses them of " hibernating " as the economic crisis deepened and americans began laying off staff . according to the survey taken by the german american chamber of commerce and the consulting firm droege and company , 67 percent of german companies operating in the u.s. were ill-prepared for the economic doldrums that have stifled the business climate there .
its findings mark a dramatically negative psychological shift among managers of german companies .
in a poll conducted in the summer , 80 percent said they were optimistic the economy would soon turn around .
but today , only 49 percent remain optimistic .
the rest see dark economic clouds ahead and a slower-than-hoped-for recovery period .
sixty-three percent of the 439 german companies surveyed in the manufacturing and services sector have been hard hit by weak economic growth in the u.s. firms have been hardest struck on the west coast and in the southeast , where troubles in the information technology and telecommunications sectors have been concentrated .
pulling up the stakes more than half of the companies polled reported at least 20 percent losses in revenues and earnings .
indeed , 9 percent were so badly affected that they decided to pull up their stakes and head back to germany - a figure the report described as " disturbingly high . "
the study points to some important differences between american and german business styles that could have played a role .
generally , german companies tend to react less quickly to economic crises .
" german companies are slower in doing layoffs or significant cost-cutting initiatives , " christoph kühne , a principal at droege who worked on the survey , told dw-world .
rather than reevaluating business strategies , organizational structures or staffing levels , many have taken the approach of trying to weather out the crisis .
but slowly , the report found , german companies are waking up from their winter sleep .
" they 're being less reserved about these measures , but they 're not laying off in the same massive numbers we 've seen at u.s. companies , " he said .
kühne also attributes the split in styles between the continents to differing management and corporate structures .
" one of the reasons is that german management boards that are based in germany often want to be involved in decision-making for the u.s. marketplace and there 's a time delay , " said kühne .
" it also makes it tougher for companies to operate if they mimick german business behavior , " he says , noting that greater speed and aggressiveness are needed for german companies to compete successfully in the american marketplace .
u.s. opportunities still to be found belt-tightening aside , kühne says there is plenty of upside potential for german companies doing business in doldrums-stricken america .
indeed , there are more than 1,800 german companies with subsidiaries or operations in the u.s. together , they generate annual revenue of $ 500 billion and employ more than a million people .
the weak u.s. economy creates new opportunities for global players like daimlerchrysler , porsche or siemens , which have the opportunity to acquire undervalued companies or to expand markets for their products at a time when their american counterparts are struggling and have shrunken marketing budgets .
among the " winners " cited by the report is porsche , which in addition to improving its operations , has also created a sport utility vehicle unit in order to better exploit the u.s. market .
" if you have a strong product or service , then it makes sense to try to gain market share and gain new customers while your american competitor is in a weakened state , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still scares off investors , say u.s. firms finance minister eichel 's much-heralded tax reform has just come into effect but germany will still be hard pressed to sell itself as a prime location for business according to tax experts at the us chamber of commerce .

it accuses them of " hibernating " as the economic crisis deepened and americans began laying off staff . according to the survey taken by the german american chamber of commerce and the consulting firm droege and company , 67 percent of german companies operating in the u.s. were ill-prepared for the economic doldrums that have stifled the business climate there .
its findings mark a dramatically negative psychological shift among managers of german companies .
in a poll conducted in the summer , 80 percent said they were optimistic the economy would soon turn around .
but today , only 49 percent remain optimistic .
the rest see dark economic clouds ahead and a slower-than-hoped-for recovery period .
sixty-three percent of the 439 german companies surveyed in the manufacturing and services sector have been hard hit by weak economic growth in the u.s. firms have been hardest struck on the west coast and in the southeast , where troubles in the information technology and telecommunications sectors have been concentrated .
pulling up the stakes more than half of the companies polled reported at least 20 percent losses in revenues and earnings .
indeed , 9 percent were so badly affected that they decided to pull up their stakes and head back to germany - a figure the report described as " disturbingly high . "
the study points to some important differences between american and german business styles that could have played a role .
generally , german companies tend to react less quickly to economic crises .
" german companies are slower in doing layoffs or significant cost-cutting initiatives , " christoph kühne , a principal at droege who worked on the survey , told dw-world .
rather than reevaluating business strategies , organizational structures or staffing levels , many have taken the approach of trying to weather out the crisis .
but slowly , the report found , german companies are waking up from their winter sleep .
" they 're being less reserved about these measures , but they 're not laying off in the same massive numbers we 've seen at u.s. companies , " he said .
kühne also attributes the split in styles between the continents to differing management and corporate structures .
" one of the reasons is that german management boards that are based in germany often want to be involved in decision-making for the u.s. marketplace and there 's a time delay , " said kühne .

germany 's chancellor was under pressure to deliver in parliament on wednesday .
however more bad economic news put a damper on his performance . it was billed as his blood , sweat and tears speech , a wake-up call to germany and its people .

in the face of a seemingly never-ending stream of gloomy economic news , accusations by the conservative opposition of deceiving the electorate about the state of the economy , and plummeting popularity rates , schröder chose to keep a low profile .
schröder attacks earlier this week , under pressure from detractors within his own party to confront the public with a coherent stance on germany 's economic problems , schröder announced that he would use the budgetary debate in parliament to address the issues .
following the opening speech by michael glos , the parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union , who accused the government of complete failure with its economic policies , schröder launched a series of fierce attacks on the opposition .
he said the opposition conservatives were unsurpassable in their lack of content .
there was no sign , he said , of viable proposals to solve the country 's problems .

in the face of a seemingly never-ending stream of gloomy economic news , accusations by the conservative opposition of deceiving the electorate about the state of the economy , and plummeting popularity rates , schröder chose to keep a low profile .
schröder attacks earlier this week , under pressure from detractors within his own party to confront the public with a coherent stance on germany 's economic problems , schröder announced that he would use the budgetary debate in parliament to address the issues .
following the opening speech by michael glos , the parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union , who accused the government of complete failure with its economic policies , schröder launched a series of fierce attacks on the opposition .
he said the opposition conservatives were unsurpassable in their lack of content .
there was no sign , he said , of viable proposals to solve the country 's problems .

schröder also called on the opposition to work constructively with his government .
his coalition of social democrats and greens face a conservative majority in the upper legislative chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , where cdu and csu have the power to block the passage of labor market reforms proposed by the government .

germany 's chancellor was under pressure to deliver in parliament on wednesday .
however more bad economic news put a damper on his performance . it was billed as his blood , sweat and tears speech , a wake-up call to germany and its people .
and observers say chancellor gerhard schröder 's performance on wednesday during the parliamentary budget debate for 2003 was a return to form and a much-needed boost for his party , the social democrats .
in the face of a seemingly never-ending stream of gloomy economic news , accusations by the conservative opposition of deceiving the electorate about the state of the economy , and plummeting popularity rates , schröder chose to keep a low profile .
schröder attacks earlier this week , under pressure from detractors within his own party to confront the public with a coherent stance on germany 's economic problems , schröder announced that he would use the budgetary debate in parliament to address the issues .
following the opening speech by michael glos , the parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union , who accused the government of complete failure with its economic policies , schröder launched a series of fierce attacks on the opposition .
he said the opposition conservatives were unsurpassable in their lack of content .
there was no sign , he said , of viable proposals to solve the country 's problems .
he talked of personal defamation and called on angela merkel , leader of the christian democratic union , to " call back the political agitators within her ranks . "
more reforms schröder conceded that the economic situation in germany was worse than expected at the beginning of the year .
" there is no doubt that we are experiencing economic problems , " he said , but stressed that the downturn was due to the global economic climate .
backing his finance minister hans eichel , who on tuesday announced further cuts into the welfare system , schröder said further social reforms were needed , especially in the pension system , where contribution rates for employers and employees are set to rise to 19.5 percent from 19.1 percent .
schröder also called on the opposition to work constructively with his government .
his coalition of social democrats and greens face a conservative majority in the upper legislative chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , where cdu and csu have the power to block the passage of labor market reforms proposed by the government .
lack of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel cdu leader merkel accused schröder of lacking in leadership .
his policies , she said , were damaging germany 's prospects of an economic recovery .
" you are not shaping policies , " she said .
she said it was representative of schröder 's stance that he did not mention the latest rise in german unemployment .
more gloom indeed , the data released by the federal labor office paints a gloomy picture .
it shows that the number of jobless rose to its highest november level in five years climbing above the psychologically sensitive 4-million mark .
the seasonally adjusted figure rose by 35,000 from october to 4.161 million disastrous opinion poll figures are piling on the pressure even more .
the latest survey shows that the social democrats would only gain 27 percent of the vote if elections were held this sunday , a loss of 11.5 percentage points compared to september 's general election .
the union parties meanwhile would win 50 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany on the brink of recession germany 's most important business climate index continued to fall last month .

it accuses them of " hibernating " as the economic crisis deepened and americans began laying off staff . according to the survey taken by the german american chamber of commerce and the consulting firm droege and company , 67 percent of german companies operating in the u.s. were ill-prepared for the economic doldrums that have stifled the business climate there .
its findings mark a dramatically negative psychological shift among managers of german companies .
in a poll conducted in the summer , 80 percent said they were optimistic the economy would soon turn around .
but today , only 49 percent remain optimistic .
the rest see dark economic clouds ahead and a slower-than-hoped-for recovery period .
sixty-three percent of the 439 german companies surveyed in the manufacturing and services sector have been hard hit by weak economic growth in the u.s. firms have been hardest struck on the west coast and in the southeast , where troubles in the information technology and telecommunications sectors have been concentrated .
pulling up the stakes more than half of the companies polled reported at least 20 percent losses in revenues and earnings .
indeed , 9 percent were so badly affected that they decided to pull up their stakes and head back to germany - a figure the report described as " disturbingly high . "
the study points to some important differences between american and german business styles that could have played a role .
generally , german companies tend to react less quickly to economic crises .
" german companies are slower in doing layoffs or significant cost-cutting initiatives , " christoph kühne , a principal at droege who worked on the survey , told dw-world .
rather than reevaluating business strategies , organizational structures or staffing levels , many have taken the approach of trying to weather out the crisis .
but slowly , the report found , german companies are waking up from their winter sleep .
" they 're being less reserved about these measures , but they 're not laying off in the same massive numbers we 've seen at u.s. companies , " he said .
kühne also attributes the split in styles between the continents to differing management and corporate structures .
" one of the reasons is that german management boards that are based in germany often want to be involved in decision-making for the u.s. marketplace and there 's a time delay , " said kühne .
" it also makes it tougher for companies to operate if they mimick german business behavior , " he says , noting that greater speed and aggressiveness are needed for german companies to compete successfully in the american marketplace .
u.s. opportunities still to be found belt-tightening aside , kühne says there is plenty of upside potential for german companies doing business in doldrums-stricken america .
indeed , there are more than 1,800 german companies with subsidiaries or operations in the u.s. together , they generate annual revenue of $ 500 billion and employ more than a million people .
the weak u.s. economy creates new opportunities for global players like daimlerchrysler , porsche or siemens , which have the opportunity to acquire undervalued companies or to expand markets for their products at a time when their american counterparts are struggling and have shrunken marketing budgets .
among the " winners " cited by the report is porsche , which in addition to improving its operations , has also created a sport utility vehicle unit in order to better exploit the u.s. market .

" one of the reasons is that german management boards that are based in germany often want to be involved in decision-making for the u.s. marketplace and there 's a time delay , " said kühne .
" it also makes it tougher for companies to operate if they mimick german business behavior , " he says , noting that greater speed and aggressiveness are needed for german companies to compete successfully in the american marketplace .
u.s. opportunities still to be found belt-tightening aside , kühne says there is plenty of upside potential for german companies doing business in doldrums-stricken america .
indeed , there are more than 1,800 german companies with subsidiaries or operations in the u.s. together , they generate annual revenue of $ 500 billion and employ more than a million people .
the weak u.s. economy creates new opportunities for global players like daimlerchrysler , porsche or siemens , which have the opportunity to acquire undervalued companies or to expand markets for their products at a time when their american counterparts are struggling and have shrunken marketing budgets .
among the " winners " cited by the report is porsche , which in addition to improving its operations , has also created a sport utility vehicle unit in order to better exploit the u.s. market .
" if you have a strong product or service , then it makes sense to try to gain market share and gain new customers while your american competitor is in a weakened state , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still scares off investors , say u.s. firms finance minister eichel 's much-heralded tax reform has just come into effect but germany will still be hard pressed to sell itself as a prime location for business according to tax experts at the us chamber of commerce .

schröder attacks earlier this week , under pressure from detractors within his own party to confront the public with a coherent stance on germany 's economic problems , schröder announced that he would use the budgetary debate in parliament to address the issues .
following the opening speech by michael glos , the parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union , who accused the government of complete failure with its economic policies , schröder launched a series of fierce attacks on the opposition .
he said the opposition conservatives were unsurpassable in their lack of content .
there was no sign , he said , of viable proposals to solve the country 's problems .
he talked of personal defamation and called on angela merkel , leader of the christian democratic union , to " call back the political agitators within her ranks . "
more reforms schröder conceded that the economic situation in germany was worse than expected at the beginning of the year .
" there is no doubt that we are experiencing economic problems , " he said , but stressed that the downturn was due to the global economic climate .
backing his finance minister hans eichel , who on tuesday announced further cuts into the welfare system , schröder said further social reforms were needed , especially in the pension system , where contribution rates for employers and employees are set to rise to 19.5 percent from 19.1 percent .
schröder also called on the opposition to work constructively with his government .
his coalition of social democrats and greens face a conservative majority in the upper legislative chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , where cdu and csu have the power to block the passage of labor market reforms proposed by the government .
lack of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel cdu leader merkel accused schröder of lacking in leadership .
his policies , she said , were damaging germany 's prospects of an economic recovery .
" you are not shaping policies , " she said .
she said it was representative of schröder 's stance that he did not mention the latest rise in german unemployment .
more gloom indeed , the data released by the federal labor office paints a gloomy picture .
it shows that the number of jobless rose to its highest november level in five years climbing above the psychologically sensitive 4-million mark .
the seasonally adjusted figure rose by 35,000 from october to 4.161 million disastrous opinion poll figures are piling on the pressure even more .
the latest survey shows that the social democrats would only gain 27 percent of the vote if elections were held this sunday , a loss of 11.5 percentage points compared to september 's general election .
the union parties meanwhile would win 50 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany on the brink of recession germany 's most important business climate index continued to fall last month .

it accuses them of " hibernating " as the economic crisis deepened and americans began laying off staff . according to the survey taken by the german american chamber of commerce and the consulting firm droege and company , 67 percent of german companies operating in the u.s. were ill-prepared for the economic doldrums that have stifled the business climate there .
its findings mark a dramatically negative psychological shift among managers of german companies .
in a poll conducted in the summer , 80 percent said they were optimistic the economy would soon turn around .
but today , only 49 percent remain optimistic .
the rest see dark economic clouds ahead and a slower-than-hoped-for recovery period .
sixty-three percent of the 439 german companies surveyed in the manufacturing and services sector have been hard hit by weak economic growth in the u.s. firms have been hardest struck on the west coast and in the southeast , where troubles in the information technology and telecommunications sectors have been concentrated .
pulling up the stakes more than half of the companies polled reported at least 20 percent losses in revenues and earnings .
indeed , 9 percent were so badly affected that they decided to pull up their stakes and head back to germany - a figure the report described as " disturbingly high . "
the study points to some important differences between american and german business styles that could have played a role .
generally , german companies tend to react less quickly to economic crises .
" german companies are slower in doing layoffs or significant cost-cutting initiatives , " christoph kühne , a principal at droege who worked on the survey , told dw-world .
rather than reevaluating business strategies , organizational structures or staffing levels , many have taken the approach of trying to weather out the crisis .
but slowly , the report found , german companies are waking up from their winter sleep .
" they 're being less reserved about these measures , but they 're not laying off in the same massive numbers we 've seen at u.s. companies , " he said .
kühne also attributes the split in styles between the continents to differing management and corporate structures .
" one of the reasons is that german management boards that are based in germany often want to be involved in decision-making for the u.s. marketplace and there 's a time delay , " said kühne .
" it also makes it tougher for companies to operate if they mimick german business behavior , " he says , noting that greater speed and aggressiveness are needed for german companies to compete successfully in the american marketplace .
u.s. opportunities still to be found belt-tightening aside , kühne says there is plenty of upside potential for german companies doing business in doldrums-stricken america .
indeed , there are more than 1,800 german companies with subsidiaries or operations in the u.s. together , they generate annual revenue of $ 500 billion and employ more than a million people .
the weak u.s. economy creates new opportunities for global players like daimlerchrysler , porsche or siemens , which have the opportunity to acquire undervalued companies or to expand markets for their products at a time when their american counterparts are struggling and have shrunken marketing budgets .
among the " winners " cited by the report is porsche , which in addition to improving its operations , has also created a sport utility vehicle unit in order to better exploit the u.s. market .

it accuses them of " hibernating " as the economic crisis deepened and americans began laying off staff . according to the survey taken by the german american chamber of commerce and the consulting firm droege and company , 67 percent of german companies operating in the u.s. were ill-prepared for the economic doldrums that have stifled the business climate there .
its findings mark a dramatically negative psychological shift among managers of german companies .
in a poll conducted in the summer , 80 percent said they were optimistic the economy would soon turn around .
but today , only 49 percent remain optimistic .
the rest see dark economic clouds ahead and a slower-than-hoped-for recovery period .
sixty-three percent of the 439 german companies surveyed in the manufacturing and services sector have been hard hit by weak economic growth in the u.s. firms have been hardest struck on the west coast and in the southeast , where troubles in the information technology and telecommunications sectors have been concentrated .
pulling up the stakes more than half of the companies polled reported at least 20 percent losses in revenues and earnings .
indeed , 9 percent were so badly affected that they decided to pull up their stakes and head back to germany - a figure the report described as " disturbingly high . "
the study points to some important differences between american and german business styles that could have played a role .
generally , german companies tend to react less quickly to economic crises .
" german companies are slower in doing layoffs or significant cost-cutting initiatives , " christoph kühne , a principal at droege who worked on the survey , told dw-world .
rather than reevaluating business strategies , organizational structures or staffing levels , many have taken the approach of trying to weather out the crisis .
but slowly , the report found , german companies are waking up from their winter sleep .
" they 're being less reserved about these measures , but they 're not laying off in the same massive numbers we 've seen at u.s. companies , " he said .
kühne also attributes the split in styles between the continents to differing management and corporate structures .
" one of the reasons is that german management boards that are based in germany often want to be involved in decision-making for the u.s. marketplace and there 's a time delay , " said kühne .
" it also makes it tougher for companies to operate if they mimick german business behavior , " he says , noting that greater speed and aggressiveness are needed for german companies to compete successfully in the american marketplace .
u.s. opportunities still to be found belt-tightening aside , kühne says there is plenty of upside potential for german companies doing business in doldrums-stricken america .
indeed , there are more than 1,800 german companies with subsidiaries or operations in the u.s. together , they generate annual revenue of $ 500 billion and employ more than a million people .
the weak u.s. economy creates new opportunities for global players like daimlerchrysler , porsche or siemens , which have the opportunity to acquire undervalued companies or to expand markets for their products at a time when their american counterparts are struggling and have shrunken marketing budgets .
among the " winners " cited by the report is porsche , which in addition to improving its operations , has also created a sport utility vehicle unit in order to better exploit the u.s. market .
" if you have a strong product or service , then it makes sense to try to gain market share and gain new customers while your american competitor is in a weakened state , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still scares off investors , say u.s. firms finance minister eichel 's much-heralded tax reform has just come into effect but germany will still be hard pressed to sell itself as a prime location for business according to tax experts at the us chamber of commerce .

germany 's chancellor was under pressure to deliver in parliament on wednesday .
however more bad economic news put a damper on his performance . it was billed as his blood , sweat and tears speech , a wake-up call to germany and its people .
and observers say chancellor gerhard schröder 's performance on wednesday during the parliamentary budget debate for 2003 was a return to form and a much-needed boost for his party , the social democrats .
in the face of a seemingly never-ending stream of gloomy economic news , accusations by the conservative opposition of deceiving the electorate about the state of the economy , and plummeting popularity rates , schröder chose to keep a low profile .
schröder attacks earlier this week , under pressure from detractors within his own party to confront the public with a coherent stance on germany 's economic problems , schröder announced that he would use the budgetary debate in parliament to address the issues .
following the opening speech by michael glos , the parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union , who accused the government of complete failure with its economic policies , schröder launched a series of fierce attacks on the opposition .
he said the opposition conservatives were unsurpassable in their lack of content .
there was no sign , he said , of viable proposals to solve the country 's problems .
he talked of personal defamation and called on angela merkel , leader of the christian democratic union , to " call back the political agitators within her ranks . "

" there is no doubt that we are experiencing economic problems , " he said , but stressed that the downturn was due to the global economic climate .
backing his finance minister hans eichel , who on tuesday announced further cuts into the welfare system , schröder said further social reforms were needed , especially in the pension system , where contribution rates for employers and employees are set to rise to 19.5 percent from 19.1 percent .

the seasonally adjusted figure rose by 35,000 from october to 4.161 million disastrous opinion poll figures are piling on the pressure even more .

general motors saw sales fall 18 % in november , ford 's sales fell 21 % and chrysler 's sales were down 12 % .
but although the sales falls were large , they were much smaller than october 's sales slump , and sales picked up towards the end of the month .
" the first half of the month was extremely difficult , " said chrysler sales executive gary dilts .
" but it finally turned positive and we saw a significant shift " .
" our sales remain generally healthy , " said general motors sales and marketing executive bill lovejoy .
shares hit but despite the car makers ' predictions of stronger sales ahead , financial market officials were less optimistic .
" we foresee december to be maybe stable , but it 's not going to be a barnburner , " said analyst mike wall .
consequently , all the three car giants saw their shares fall sharply .
ford 's shares fell 13 % , chrysler 's parent daimlerchrysler fell 5.1 % and general motors fell 5.1 % .
incentives the us car makers are clearly suffering , though direct comparisons with last year 's sales are complicated .
sales at the time were boosted by zero interest finance for car buyers , on offer as the car makers struggled to prevent a sales slump in the wake of the 11 september attacks .
such finance deals kept fuelling sales well into the summer when they were much higher than they had been during the summer of 2001 .
" comparisons to a very strong year-ago november are difficult , " said mr lovejoy .
weak ' light truck ' sales sales of four-wheel-drive vehicles , also known as ' light trucks ' or sports utility vehicles , fell particularly far during november .
this was a reflection of these vehicles ' falling popularity in the us where the american people have been taken by storm by accusations that ' light trucks ' are antisocial vehicles .
general motors said its light truck sales fell 26.2 % in november while its car sales fell just 6 % .
chrysler 's light truck sales fell 12.6 % while car sales were down 9 % .
ford 's light truck sales fell 18.5 % .
asian car makers suffered a 5 % fall in sales in november while sales of european models were similar to last year 's .

clive fairweather said the transfer of women prisoners to greenock , a male prison , would " push things too far " and should be reversed .
mr fairweather also accused ministers of snubbing alternatives to custody because of fears over being seen as soft on crime by voters .
the comments came as he was giving evidence to the scottish parliament 's justice 1 committee on his final report before leaving the watchdog job .
when you have got 50 or 60 there then you have got a women 's prison clive fairweather former inspector he said 19 women had been moved to greenock last month because of overcrowding at scotland 's only jail for women , cornton vale .
he said : " we have already got one women 's prison in scotland and now we have got two and one has been created by stealth . "
he went on : " when you have got 50 or 60 there then you have got a women 's prison .
" so we have got two women 's prisons in scotland and i must say i ca n't emphasise enough that it was bad enough getting things right at one women 's prison .
' life-threatening ' " trying to do it at two is going to push things too far .
" eventually we have got to get back to the position where we have got one women 's prison in scotland . "
clive fairweather fears things are going too far mr fairweather also warned that overcrowding and high staff sickness levels at cornton vale , near stirling , were creating a " life-threatening " situation .
he said that was partly because the jail had become a victim of its own success with its rehabilitation programmes for its inmates .
" that evidence is anecdotal but where we have got to go is away from that and towards all these alternatives outside . "
mr fairweather was replaced as chief inspector of prisons last month by dr andrew mclellan former moderator of the general assembly of the church of scotland .
