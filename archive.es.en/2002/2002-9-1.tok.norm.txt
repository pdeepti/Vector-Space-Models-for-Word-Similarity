all six - including two men from a self-appointed tribal council in a remote part of punjab province - have been sentenced to death by hanging .
defence lawyers said they would appeal against the guilty verdict .
human rights activists in pakistan have expressed satisfaction with the conviction , but say the government must now act on the issues brought up by this case .
eight other men who were accused of abetting the rape of 30-year-old mukhtar mai in june were acquitted .
the rape was ordered by a tribal " panchyat " or council in the village of mirwali , near muzaffargarh city , to punish mukhtar mai 's family after her brother was accused of having an illicit affair with a woman from a more powerful tribe .
in many of pakistan 's remote areas , tribal councils , made up of community elders , still work like a lawful body , judging cases ranging from animal theft or tribal rivalry to murder .
mukhtar mai 's brother , abdul shakoor , said the story of his affair was concocted to cover up the fact that he had been sodomised by three men earlier in the day and threatened to report the incident .
national outrage mukhtar mai testified that when she apologised to the council , one man said she should be pardoned but another immediately insisted that she should be raped .
she described begging the council to save her , but they took no notice and four men raped her while hundreds of villagers did nothing to stop the assault .
afterwards , she said she was forced to walk home half-naked in full public view , covered only with a piece of cloth .
however the police took no action until a case was registered a week after the rape .
the role played in the incident the village council , which has no legal standing , has raised particular concerns .
a spokesman for the human rights commission said the government had allowed this kind of informal justice system to flourish throughout the country and it needed to be immediately controlled .
activists also say this case illustrates the horrific abuse many women face in pakistan , with most of them never seeing their attackers brought to justice .
the bbc 's susannah price in islamabad says the widespread publicity surrounding this case ensured it was brought before an anti-terrorism court , which dealt with it relatively quickly . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's susannah price " the crime has caused outrage in pakistan " see also : 03 jul 02 -pipe- south asia protests over pakistan gang rape 28 may 02 -pipe- south asia south asia rivals ' abuse rights ' 24 aug 01 -pipe- south asia pakistan 's rising toll of domestic violence 27 apr 01 -pipe- south asia pakistan women work for change 14 jun 00 -pipe- south asia south asian women ' vulnerable ' 21 apr 00 -pipe- south asia musharraf promises end to pakistan abuses 02 may 02 -pipe- country profiles country profile : pakistan internet links : government of punjab government of pakistan the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top south asia stories now : pakistan floods leave many dead india and pakistan let envoys return windies game called off hindu activists arrested in religious dispute troops resume dhaka crime fight bangladeshis flock to ' weeping virgin ' bhutan refugees on hunger strike ex-gurkhas take mod to court links to more south asia stories are at the foot of the page .

we have received information from local police sources that there are indications that the act was committed by elements of opm -lrb- rebels -rrb- foreign ministry spokesman marty natalegawa the incident occurred about 0800 local time -lrb- 2300 gmt saturday -rrb- , papua major general simbolon mahadin said .
security officials said a soldier was injured in the clash .
police and troops have launched a major operation to hunt down those behind saturday 's attack , in which nine other foreigners and five local people were also injured .
however the search was suspended after bad weather closed in on the area .
separatist movement no group has claimed responsibility for the attack - the worst incident involving foreigners ever to take place in west papua .
however government officials said they suspected separatist rebel group the free papua movement -lrb- opm -rrb- , reuters news agency reported .
there has been a separatist movement in west papua since the 1960s " we have received information from local police sources that there are indications that the act was committed by elements of opm , " indonesian foreign ministry spokesman marty natalegawa said .
there has been a separatist rebellion in the province - formerly known as irian jaya - since the 1960s , but this is the first time foreigners have been targeted .
the separatist rebellion in the province has been very low-key , with violent attacks by the rebels usually rare .
both attacks took place very close to the american-owned freeport mine , which is the world 's largest gold mine and is protected by hundreds of indonesian troops .
freeport has been criticised by activists for its environmental record and its impact on the local community .
the company released a statement on sunday saying that it " deplored " the attack but that operations were continuing as normal .
" indonesian security officials ... have provided assurances that the pt freeport indonesia mine facilities and surrounding communities are secure , " it said .

prime minister mahathir mohamad said he would accede to a request from philippines president gloria arroyo to allow her time to send officials to inspect the holding centres .
hundreds of filipinos were deported on saturday before the suspension he rejected accusations from manila that the migrants were being treated inhumanely , but said he was prepared to put deportations on hold briefly .
he made it clear there would be no change to malaysia 's tough new law allowing for the caning and jailing of illegal workers - a policy which has seen hundreds of thousands of indonesians and filipinos leave the country , though many still remain .
mrs arroyo asked dr mahathir if she could send a delegation on monday to see the camps in the malaysian state of sabah , across the sea from the southern philippines .
official complaint the philippines government filed an official complaint with malaysia saying three infants had died during repatriation - but malaysian camp officials have denied that any died in their jurisdiction .
i said you can send somebody to see -lsb- the camps -rsb- - no problem malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad there are unconfirmed reports of another 10 filipino child deaths and indonesian authorities say at least 27 indonesian workers who recently left malaysia have also died .
dr mahathir was quoted by the national bernama news agency as agreeing to mrs arroyo 's request .
" she asked me whether we can take a short break in sending their people home , " he said .
" i agreed because they want to send somebody to see .
i said you can send somebody to see - no problem . "
deportations ' will resume ' once the team from manila was satisfied there was no ill treatment , the deportations would resume , he said .
malaysia 's anti-illegal immigration law came into force on 1 august , though an amnesty was extended for workers who could prove they had tickets to leave the country .
more than 300,000 mostly indonesian and filipino workers have left malaysia this year .
a great tragedy is happening in the southern philippines philippines president gloria arroyo but there has been anger both from the people being told to leave - some after many years - and from employers in sectors such as construction , who say they need the foreign labour .
the detention centres have proved particularly controversial , with malaysia claiming they had been inspected and approved by united nations staff , but the un 's refugee agency denying it had visited or sanctioned the conditions .
mrs arroyo has visited some of the returning filipinos and said in her weekly radio address she had seen " first-hand the sufferings of thousands of deportees from sabah " .
" a great tragedy is happening in the southern philippines , " she said .
but mrs arroyo also moved to cool the row with malaysia , which she called " our ally in security , peace and development " .
on saturday , more than 450 filipinos , including 250 who had been arrested and held in a detention centre , left sabah , the latest of about 2,000 deportations on navy ships before the suspension was announced , officials said .

researchers found that early surgical intervention reduced the rate of severe angina among these patients by 50 % .
carrying out the procedure promptly also saves further pain and possible death professor keith fox angina is a pain or feeling of tightness in the chest .
it is a tell-tale warning sign for coronary heart disease and often leads to a heart attack .
it occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen due to a narrowing of one of the arteries that supply blood to the heart .
the study suggests it could be avoided in many cases if patients underwent surgical treatments soon after they were identified as being at a possible risk .
possible treatments include coronary artery bypass surgery , or balloon angioplasty , when a device is used to unclog blocked blood vessels .
controversial area considerable debate surrounds the treatment of patients who show signs of being at risk of heart attack .
some experts favour a conservative " wait and see " policy over surgical intervention .
according to international registries such as the euro heart survey , only a quarter of patients with severe angina are referred for invasive surgery when they are first hospitalised .
the british heart foundation randomised intervention trial of unstable angina -lrb- rita -rrb- focused on 1,810 patients at moderate risk of heart attack .
the patients were given surgical treatment at an early stage , or monitored for signs of deterioration before such treatment took place .
both groups received an anti-clotting drug .
after four months , 9.6 % of patients in the intervention group had died , had a heart attack , or had angina , compared with 14.5 % of patients in " wait and see " group .
the difference was mainly due to a halving of the angina rate in the intervention group .
dangers lead researcher professor keith fox , of the university of edinburgh , said : " the hazards of intervention seem to be more than counterbalanced by the subsequent reduction in risk of heart attack . "
" carrying out the procedure promptly also saves further pain and possible death for those who are currently placed under a ' watch and wait ' regime . "
however , he said the study would not yield conclusive proof of the benefits of early intervention until a five year follow-up period had been completed .
angina is a huge problem in the uk , with an estimated 2.1m people who either have or have had the condition .
the research is published on the online version of the lancet medical journal . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's matthew hill " more than 300,000 people are diagnosed with angina every year " belinda linden , british heart foundation " it seems that moving in early is the important thing " neil bennett reports " early intervention is best for people at risk of heart attacks " see also : 20 mar 01 -pipe- health angina sufferers up to two million 19 aug 02 -pipe- health detecting heart disease early 30 sep 99 -pipe- health laser treatment blasts angina agony 02 mar 02 -pipe- health antibiotics ' boost heart function ' 23 jun 00 -pipe- g-i angina internet links : the lancet british heart foundation european society of cardiology the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top health stories now : heart risk link to big families back pain drug ' may aid diabetics ' congo ebola outbreak confirmed vegetables ward off alzheimer 's polio campaign launched in iraq gene defect explains high blood pressure botox ' may cause new wrinkles ' alien ' abductees ' show real symptoms links to more health stories are at the foot of the page .

george foulkes said the prime minister had made it clear to him that voters would finally have their say on the single currency next autumn .

however , downing street denied that any date had been pencilled in .

the uk government has long insisted that - before a referendum is called - chancellor gordon brown 's five economic tests must be met .
the electoral commission sounded a note of caution earlier this year when it advised against holding a referendum on the euro next may .
the body , which monitors the administration of elections and political party finances , said holding a referendum on 1 may 2003 would cause " significant confusion " among voters .
it warned that with the likely cross-party campaigns for both the " yes " and " no " camps , the upshot could be widespread confusion .

mr evans will spend his birthday at his home in pencarreg in west wales with his wife rhiannon - but as a lifelong teetotaller , will not be toasting the occasion with champagne .
he is probably best known for threatening to starve himself if a welsh language station was not set up - a threat which routed even the then prime minister , margaret thatcher .
plaid cymru president ieuan wyn jones sent a birthday message to mr evans on behalf of his party .
he said : " gwynfor 's inspiration and leadership of wales over the years makes him one of the greatest welshmen of any period in the history of wales .
" may this great man continue to inspire us for many years to come , and the greatest tribute we can pay gwynfor is to keep working for a better future for our country and our nation . "
on friday , a portrait of mr evans bought by friends and supporters of mr evans was presented to the national library of wales to mark his birthday .
although he is now confined to bed suffering from osteoporosis , mr evans still takes a keen interest in the politics of wales .
pacifist born in barry , south wales in 1912 , mr evans lived for most of his life in llangadog , carmarthenshire , before moving to pencarreg .
he married rhiannon and they had seven children , 15 grand-children and great-grand-children .
mr evans was educated in barry before following a course at the university of wales , aberystwyth and then a course at jesus college oxford .
at the age of 18 he started to learn welsh and became a fluent welsh speaker .
whilst at college he established a branch of plaid cymru .
although he graduated and trained to be a solicitor he worked as a commercial gardener in llangadog until his retirement .
he refused to join the armed forces during the second world war because he was a pacifist and a christian and he had to appear before a tribunal .
he was unconditionally dismissed .
first plaid cymru mp in 1945 he was elected plaid cymru 's president and later became their honourable president for over 30 years .
during the 1950 's he campaigned to establish a welsh government and was also the leader in opposing liverpool city council 's intention to drown the village of cwm celyn near bala to make a water reservoir .
although these campaigns were unsuccessful - tryweryn reservoir opened in 1965 - a victory came to gwynfor evans and plaid cymru .
in 1966 he won the by-election in carmarthen after the death of the labour mp , dame megan lloyd george , the daughter of the former welsh prime minister , david lloyd george .
mr evans 's victory was among the most unexpected in british political history , as plaid cymru won their first seat in westminster .
hundreds of supporters travelled to london to see him going to westminster for the first time .
in 1967 harold wilson 's government passed the welsh language act but three years later , mr evans lost his seat to the labour candidate , gwynoro jones .
but mr evans returned to london in 1974 , this time with two new fellow plaid cymru mp 's , dafydd ellis thomas -lrb- who later became lord ellis thomas of nant conwy -rrb- and dafydd wigley .
however , he lost his seat in 1979 and did not return to westminster again , although he kept an active interest in welsh affairs .
tv channel protest the nation was shocked to hear that mr evans was ready to fast to death if necessary if thatcher 's government would not establish a welsh language television channel in 1980 .
during the 1970s , mr evans had been very active in the campaign to establish a welsh channel and the latest act was an act that inspired many to protest .
many people refused to pay their tv licences and the government had to concede defeat .
in 1982 , the welsh language station s4c was launched .
the history of wales was very important to mr evans , not only as a politician , but also as a christian .
he wrote a number of books in both welsh and english about wales , his latest in 2001 , ' cymru o hud ' in welsh and eternal wales in english .
