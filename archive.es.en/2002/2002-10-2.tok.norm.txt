colin powell wants the inspectors to wait by elizabeth blunt bbc correspondent at the united nations in new york a senior state department official has said the united states would be prepared to " thwart " the return of un weapons inspectors to iraq until the security council passes a resolution giving them a new , much tougher mandate .
but does any one security council member have the power to prevent the inspectors going back ?
if inspectors return to iraq now , they will be bound by old un resolutions officials working at the heart of the un system say there are two answers to the question of whether the us can stop the inspectors - one legal and the other political .
legally , no , they can not .
the inspectors have their mandate , given to them under past security council resolutions , and they continue to carry out that mandate until it is revoked or changed by a new resolution of the council .
a new resolution is , of course , exactly what the us is trying to introduce at the moment , and the difficulty that it is having bears witness to the fact that it can not do this on its own .
but the political answer is another matter . : who backs war ?
where key nations stand on iraq insiders point out that the inspectorate is the servant of the security council , set up by it to do its work .
it makes no sense for hans blix and his inspectors to proceed , blindly carrying out their existing mandate , if they can see that the council is unhappy with what they are doing .
so when dr blix returns to new york later this week to brief the security council , he will also try to get a sense of how the council wants him to proceed , and whether his inspectors should wait a little before they go to baghdad .
as us secretary of state colin powell said , there is no magic calendar which dictates exactly which day they should do what - and when it comes to political influence , america 's superpower status means that the us opinion carries extra weight .

the off-road image has gradually transformed itself into on-road chic james rosenstein , toyota europe " this car looks like a porsche , feels like a porsche , drives like a porsche , so we know that the customer base is waiting for this , " chief executive wendelin wiedeking told bbc news .
similar exuberance was expressed by volkswagen which entered the sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- market with the touareg , a four-wheel-drive model jointly developed with the cayenne .
elsewhere at the show , four-wheel-drive offerings from the likes of bmw , land rover and toyota were vying for attention .
" people buy cars for the performance they can deliver , but they also buy them for image , " toyota europe 's james rosenstein said .
" the off-road image has gradually transformed itself into on-road chic .
" i definitely believe that this is a growth market . "
backlash but despite the positive spin from the car makers , it seems the market for suvs , also known as 4x4s or light trucks , is looking decidedly shaky .
high and mighty 's author is intensely disliked in detroit in the us , where light trucks outsell cars , the american people have been taken by storm by accusations that suvs are anti-social .
suvs are the most dangerous cars on the road for all drivers , according to recent findings by the university of michigan and the lawrence berkeley national laboratory .
and in a book titled " high and mighty - suvs : the world 's most dangerous vehicles and how they got that way " , the detroit bureau chief of the new york times , keith bradsher , argues that trucks pose threats both to the environment and road safety .
death and pollution suvs , with their raised bumpers , endanger both pedestrians and motorists in smaller , standard cars .
yet suv drivers are at least as likely as car occupants to die in a crash and much more likely to be paralysed , mr bradsher says .
is this an anti-social vehicle ?
in fact , more than one in four traffic deaths in the us take place when an suv rolls over , mr bradsher says .
moreover , because suvs are classified as trucks , not cars , they are subject to less stringent environmental regulations and are allowed to emit up to five times as much air pollution as cars , he says .
the anti-suv sentiment has spread fast to new york where environmentalists have been plastering trucks with " propaganda designed to look like parking tickets " , according to the car industry website , just-auto.com.
even the image of those who drive suvs is at risk , with mr bradsher describing them as " insecure and vain " people who are " nervous about their marriages and uncomfortable about parenthood " .
tough to defend for car makers , the anti-suv sentiment has come as a shock .
it can get depressing and difficult at times to be living in a company town where the companies hate you keith bradsher , detroit bureau chief , new york times and they are clearly finding it hard to hit back .
take the porsche cayenne .
its 4.5 litre v8 engine can hardly be described as green .
and accusations that it poses a threat to road safety are hard to counter , given that the motor press is describing it as the world 's fastest suv .
market forces the car makers have consistently insisted that they have developed suvs in response to customers ' demands .
that defence may appear plausible when voiced by , say , porsche or volkswagen , which are among the last entrants into the suv market .
but when detroit 's big three car makers - ford , general motors and chrysler - claim the same , it sounds much less convincing .
mr brasher believes the car industry developed suvs to exploit more lenient safety , fuel economy and pollution standards for trucks which , as working vehicles , are allowed to have large engines .
by making trucks more luxurious and driver friendly , and marketing them as powerful lifestyle vehicles , the us car makers have turned car buyers into suv customers , he argues .
vital market for the car industry , it is vital to maintain the momentum and keep the suv market growing .
not only are these vehicles hugely profitable .
virtually all car makers have spent a fortune to develop them , and need sales to remain strong to achieve decent investment returns .

"
the off-road image has gradually transformed itself into on-road chic " james rosenstein , toyota europe " this car looks like a porsche , feels like a porsche , drives like a porsche , so we know that the customer base is waiting for this , " chief executive wendelin wiedeking told bbc news .
similar exuberance was expressed by volkswagen which entered the sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- market with the touareg , a four-wheel-drive model jointly developed with the cayenne .
elsewhere at the show , four-wheel-drive offerings from the likes of bmw , land rover and toyota were vying for attention .
" people buy cars for the performance they can deliver , but they also buy them for image , " toyota europe 's james rosenstein said .
" the off-road image has gradually transformed itself into on-road chic .
" i definitely believe that this is a growth market . "
backlash but despite the positive spin from the car makers , it seems the market for suvs , also known as 4x4s or light trucks , is looking decidedly shaky .
in the us , where light trucks outsell cars , the american people have been taken by storm by accusations that suvs are anti-social .
suvs are the most dangerous cars on the road for all drivers , according to recent findings by the university of michigan and the lawrence berkeley national laboratory .
and in a book titled " high and mighty - suvs : the world 's most dangerous vehicles and how they got that way " , the detroit bureau chief of the new york times , keith bradsher , argues that trucks pose threats both to the environment and road safety .
death and pollution suvs , with their raised bumpers , endanger both pedestrians and motorists in smaller , standard cars .
yet suv drivers are at least as likely as car occupants to die in a crash and much more likely to be paralysed , mr bradsher says .
in fact , more than one in four traffic deaths in the us take place when an suv rolls over , mr bradsher says .
moreover , because suvs are classified as trucks , not cars , they are subject to less stringent environmental regulations and are allowed to emit up to five times as much air pollution as cars , he says .
the anti-suv sentiment has spread fast to new york where environmentalists have been plastering trucks with " propaganda designed to look like parking tickets " , according to the car industry website , just-auto.com.
even the image of those who drive suvs is at risk , with mr bradsher describing them as " insecure and vain " people who are " nervous about their marriages and uncomfortable about parenthood " .
tough to defend for car makers , the anti-suv sentiment has come as a shock . "
it can get depressing and difficult at times to be living in a company town where the companies hate you " keith bradsher , detroit bureau chief , new york times and they are clearly finding it hard to hit back .
take the porsche cayenne .
its 4.5 litre v8 engine can hardly be described as green .
and accusations that it poses a threat to road safety are hard to counter , given that the motor press is describing it as the world 's fastest suv .
market forces the car makers have consistently insisted that they have developed suvs in response to customers ' demands .
that defence may appear plausible when voiced by , say , porsche or volkswagen , which are among the last entrants into the suv market .
but when detroit 's big three car makers - ford , general motors and chrysler - claim the same , it sounds much less convincing .
mr brasher believes the car industry developed suvs to exploit more lenient safety , fuel economy and pollution standards for trucks which , as working vehicles , are allowed to have large engines .
by making trucks more luxurious and driver friendly , and marketing them as powerful lifestyle vehicles , the us car makers have turned car buyers into suv customers , he argues .
vital market for the car industry , it is vital to maintain the momentum and keep the suv market growing .
not only are these vehicles hugely profitable .
virtually all car makers have spent a fortune to develop them , and need sales to remain strong to achieve decent investment returns .
so it should come as no surprise that mr bradsher is an unpopular man in motown .
" it can get depressing and difficult at times to be living in a company town where the companies hate you , " he told columbia journalism review .

scandal-hit senator robert torricelli abruptly pulled out of the november election on monday - after the deadline for candidates to submit their names for the ballot paper .
mr torricelli missed the deadline for changing candidates his republican opponents argue that he may not be replaced , saying ballot papers have been printed and distributed and some postal votes have already been received .
but the democrats - who hold a one-seat majority in the us senate - are keen to offer voters a replacement for mr torricelli .
the court issued an order saying it would hear the case directly instead of waiting for a lower court to act , accepting a democratic submission which stressed the urgency of the matter .
the high court hearing is scheduled for wednesday morning .
new candidate named the democrats picked a former senator , frank lautenberg , to replace mr torricelli , who ended his campaign in an emotional speech .
correspondents say democrats were concerned for mr torricelli 's re-election chances after allegations from businessman david chang who said he gave the senator gifts in return for his intervention in business deals in north and south korea .
the people of new jersey have had enough of playing politics with the fundamental tenets of democracy republican candidate doug forrester mr torricelli - who was elected in 1996 - has denied any illegality but was admonished over the summer by the senate ethics committee .
mr lautenberg , who feuded openly with mr torricelli who was his senate colleague until he retired at the elections two years ago , said he was hoping to get his name on the ballot paper .
" i look forward to this campaign , in some ways rather perversely , it will be the shortest campaign i 've ever been engaged in , but i sort of like the prospects , " he said .
' potential for chaos ' the republican candidate for the senate , doug forrester , said : " in 36 days , decency , fairness and the rule of the law will trump this desperate attempt to retain power .
" the people of new jersey have had enough of playing politics with the fundamental tenets of democracy . "
it 's all about ensuring that the voters of this state have the opportunity to exercise a choice in a competitive race democrat campaign lawyer angelo genova his campaign 's lawyer , bill baroni , said the case created " a potential for chaos " .
" ballots have been printed in many counties , " he said .
" absentee ballots have been sent , and even more troubling , federal oversees military ballots have been mailed .
votes have been received . "
printing of ballots has now been halted with some analysts saying the case could end up before the us supreme court in circumstances reminiscent of the controversial 2000 presidential election in florida .
' technicality ' a lawyer for the democratic party in new jersey , angelo genova , said the deadline for candidates pulling out was merely a technicality , adding that there was a 1952 precedent for changing names , allowed when a candidate died .
" it 's all about ensuring that the voters of this state have the opportunity to exercise a choice in a competitive race , " he said .
" the two-party system that affords people such a choice should not be compromised by any legal niceties or other administrative technicalities in our law . "
the democrats currently hold 50 senate seats , with republicans controlling 49 senate seats and senator jim jeffords of vermont , formerly a republican , declared as an independent .

you might have thought that juggling work and family life would not be a problem , once you hit 50 .
but a new academic study suggests that people in their fifties and upwards are being run ragged , because of the conflicting demands of work and family .
tell us what you think .
click here to go straight to our email form many over fifties are looking after older relatives or grandchildren .
some are still looking after their own children , according to new research form the joseph rowntree foundation .
it 's warning that , without more resources to support carers , their contribution may not be sustainable .
nanesha : finds she has no time for herself we talked to one carer , nanesha nelson , who finds it tough to combine her job as a playgroup leader with caring for an elderly relative sufferiing from alzheimer 's. click here to watch our interview click here for the joseph rowntree foundation website for the report 's findings .
the report says : demand is increasing for informal care , and individuals are bearing the costs both financially and emotionally .
both men and women are carers , though women do more than men .
men generally do less than 5 hours a week .
there is a general lack of support from employers , but often employees do n't realise what benefits are available and also feel unable to take advantage of benefits due to job security .
workers are very dedicated in their jobs and this means that caring responsibilities takes a toll on family life and carer health .
in the work environment , it is often the manager that determines access to care .
it recommends : a one-stop-shop place to ask for help .
for instance help with researching care homes , finding out about benefits .
care requirements change so much from person to person that it is flexibility that is required .
