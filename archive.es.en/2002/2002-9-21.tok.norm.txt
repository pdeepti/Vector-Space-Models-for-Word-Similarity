despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "

20 .
during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "
when asked whether he hoped schröder would change his position if he is elected to a second term , wolfowitz replied , " i certainly hope so .

the country ’ s prominent papers as well as germany ’ s jewish community condemned däubler-gmelin for remarks made during an election campaign speech earlier in the week .
although the justice minister has denied making the statements as quoted in a local newspaper , the german media has accused her and the spd government of damaging us-german relations .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has " damaged relations between berlin and washington as they have never been damaged since world war ii , " said the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper in an editorial .
the conservative daily said the damage had been caused " consciously and willingly " and that the government had " sacrificed good relations on the alter of power . "
the most recent polls show that chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats are slightly ahead in a neck-and-neck race against the conservative bloc of christian democrats and the christian social union .
many political analysts credit the edge to schröder ’ s widely popular anti-american stance regarding a war with iraq .
" poisoned atmosphere " in an interview with the financial times deutschland , u.s. national security advisor condoleeszza rice said germany had created " a poisoned atmosphere . "
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable " the daily die welt directed its criticism to the justice minister , whose remarks " illustrate not only a lack of understanding of american politics , society , mentality and history , " but " also cowardice in front of the voters and saddam hussein . "
the süddeutsche predicted that the minister ’ s statements would mean the end of her political carrier .
" in the event that schröder is re-elected , he would do right not to include däubler-gmelin in his cabinet . "
in hamburg , the president of the world jewish congress , israel singer , described the hitler comparison as " without tact , thoughtless , and shocking . "
speaking to the mass-circulation bild , he said , " after the legislative elections in germany , whoever wins them , consequences should be drawn from this affair .

america will not soon forget the hatred expressed toward our country .
in my opinion , america should break diplomatic relations with germany , remove american troops from germany , and boycott german goods and services . "
anthony and debra simmonds-amari , usa : " as longtime listeners and supporters of dw we were outraged about an official government statement attributing the tactics of hitler to the president of the us .
we are not always in accord with the actions of our president but find these remarks outrageous and perhaps a symptom of anti-americanism that is being propagated by germany .
our outrage is shared by many americans especially those of german ancestry .
while i am not in favor of a suggested boycott of all german goods , we wish to nevertheless register a protest with dw ... "
j. buerck : " the statements comparing president bush to hitler are very disturbing ! ! ! ! ! "
robert jamison , usa : " ...
däubler-gmelin , bush and hitler : i can easily see the minister sitting in front of the dutiful swabian unionists , all of them spd voters of course .
left to themselves , the good woman speaks freely , straight from the heart .
and then in a moment of inattentiveness , she lets slide what she really thinks : bush = hitler , a cliché among the inveterate anti-american german leftists .
20 years ago , we heard the same thing about reagan .
now if it had come from some clueless student , swathed in a palestinian headscarf , one wouldn ’ t think twice about it .
but from the woman from the southwest and a minister !
oh yes , she didn ’ t compare bush with hitler , only bush ’ s methods with those of hitler .

schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "

despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin surrounded by photographers at a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 .
during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .

the country ’ s prominent papers as well as germany ’ s jewish community condemned däubler-gmelin for remarks made during an election campaign speech earlier in the week .

the most recent polls show that chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats are slightly ahead in a neck-and-neck race against the conservative bloc of christian democrats and the christian social union .

"
the süddeutsche predicted that the minister ’ s statements would mean the end of her political carrier .
" in the event that schröder is re-elected , he would do right not to include däubler-gmelin in his cabinet . "
in hamburg , the president of the world jewish congress , israel singer , described the hitler comparison as " without tact , thoughtless , and shocking . "

here are some reactions from dw-world readers . anonymous : " shame on you , germany !
america will not soon forget the hatred expressed toward our country .
in my opinion , america should break diplomatic relations with germany , remove american troops from germany , and boycott german goods and services . "
anthony and debra simmonds-amari , usa : " as longtime listeners and supporters of dw we were outraged about an official government statement attributing the tactics of hitler to the president of the us .
we are not always in accord with the actions of our president but find these remarks outrageous and perhaps a symptom of anti-americanism that is being propagated by germany .
our outrage is shared by many americans especially those of german ancestry .
while i am not in favor of a suggested boycott of all german goods , we wish to nevertheless register a protest with dw ... "
j. buerck : " the statements comparing president bush to hitler are very disturbing ! ! ! ! ! "
robert jamison , usa : " ...
däubler-gmelin , bush and hitler : i can easily see the minister sitting in front of the dutiful swabian unionists , all of them spd voters of course .
left to themselves , the good woman speaks freely , straight from the heart .
and then in a moment of inattentiveness , she lets slide what she really thinks : bush = hitler , a cliché among the inveterate anti-american german leftists .
20 years ago , we heard the same thing about reagan .
now if it had come from some clueless student , swathed in a palestinian headscarf , one wouldn ’ t think twice about it .
but from the woman from the southwest and a minister !
oh yes , she didn ’ t compare bush with hitler , only bush ’ s methods with those of hitler .

despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin surrounded by photographers at a press conference in berlin on sept .

during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "
when asked whether he hoped schröder would change his position if he is elected to a second term , wolfowitz replied , " i certainly hope so .

" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "

during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "
when asked whether he hoped schröder would change his position if he is elected to a second term , wolfowitz replied , " i certainly hope so .

despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin surrounded by photographers at a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 .
during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "
when asked whether he hoped schröder would change his position if he is elected to a second term , wolfowitz replied , " i certainly hope so .

and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "
when asked whether he hoped schröder would change his position if he is elected to a second term , wolfowitz replied , " i certainly hope so .

the country ’ s prominent papers as well as germany ’ s jewish community condemned däubler-gmelin for remarks made during an election campaign speech earlier in the week .
although the justice minister has denied making the statements as quoted in a local newspaper , the german media has accused her and the spd government of damaging us-german relations .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has " damaged relations between berlin and washington as they have never been damaged since world war ii , " said the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper in an editorial .
the conservative daily said the damage had been caused " consciously and willingly " and that the government had " sacrificed good relations on the alter of power . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.09.2002 german-american relations at all-time low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were better days for us-german friendship comments made by the german justice minister likening president bush to hitler have upset leaders in washington .
despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin surrounded by photographers at a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 .
during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "

despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin surrounded by photographers at a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 .
during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "
when asked whether he hoped schröder would change his position if he is elected to a second term , wolfowitz replied , " i certainly hope so .

here are some reactions from dw-world readers . anonymous : " shame on you , germany !
america will not soon forget the hatred expressed toward our country .
in my opinion , america should break diplomatic relations with germany , remove american troops from germany , and boycott german goods and services . "
anthony and debra simmonds-amari , usa : " as longtime listeners and supporters of dw we were outraged about an official government statement attributing the tactics of hitler to the president of the us .
we are not always in accord with the actions of our president but find these remarks outrageous and perhaps a symptom of anti-americanism that is being propagated by germany .
our outrage is shared by many americans especially those of german ancestry .
while i am not in favor of a suggested boycott of all german goods , we wish to nevertheless register a protest with dw ... "
j. buerck : " the statements comparing president bush to hitler are very disturbing ! ! ! ! ! "
robert jamison , usa : " ...
däubler-gmelin , bush and hitler : i can easily see the minister sitting in front of the dutiful swabian unionists , all of them spd voters of course .
left to themselves , the good woman speaks freely , straight from the heart .
and then in a moment of inattentiveness , she lets slide what she really thinks : bush = hitler , a cliché among the inveterate anti-american german leftists .
20 years ago , we heard the same thing about reagan .
now if it had come from some clueless student , swathed in a palestinian headscarf , one wouldn ’ t think twice about it .
but from the woman from the southwest and a minister !
oh yes , she didn ’ t compare bush with hitler , only bush ’ s methods with those of hitler .

the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "

during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "
when asked whether he hoped schröder would change his position if he is elected to a second term , wolfowitz replied , " i certainly hope so .

the country ’ s prominent papers as well as germany ’ s jewish community condemned däubler-gmelin for remarks made during an election campaign speech earlier in the week .
although the justice minister has denied making the statements as quoted in a local newspaper , the german media has accused her and the spd government of damaging us-german relations .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has " damaged relations between berlin and washington as they have never been damaged since world war ii , " said the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper in an editorial .
the conservative daily said the damage had been caused " consciously and willingly " and that the government had " sacrificed good relations on the alter of power . "
the most recent polls show that chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats are slightly ahead in a neck-and-neck race against the conservative bloc of christian democrats and the christian social union .
many political analysts credit the edge to schröder ’ s widely popular anti-american stance regarding a war with iraq .
" poisoned atmosphere " in an interview with the financial times deutschland , u.s. national security advisor condoleeszza rice said germany had created " a poisoned atmosphere . "
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable " the daily die welt directed its criticism to the justice minister , whose remarks " illustrate not only a lack of understanding of american politics , society , mentality and history , " but " also cowardice in front of the voters and saddam hussein . "
the süddeutsche predicted that the minister ’ s statements would mean the end of her political carrier .
" in the event that schröder is re-elected , he would do right not to include däubler-gmelin in his cabinet . "
in hamburg , the president of the world jewish congress , israel singer , described the hitler comparison as " without tact , thoughtless , and shocking . "

despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin surrounded by photographers at a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 .
during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "

any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "

during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "
when asked whether he hoped schröder would change his position if he is elected to a second term , wolfowitz replied , " i certainly hope so .

despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .

the country ’ s prominent papers as well as germany ’ s jewish community condemned däubler-gmelin for remarks made during an election campaign speech earlier in the week .
although the justice minister has denied making the statements as quoted in a local newspaper , the german media has accused her and the spd government of damaging us-german relations .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has " damaged relations between berlin and washington as they have never been damaged since world war ii , " said the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper in an editorial .
the conservative daily said the damage had been caused " consciously and willingly " and that the government had " sacrificed good relations on the alter of power . "
the most recent polls show that chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats are slightly ahead in a neck-and-neck race against the conservative bloc of christian democrats and the christian social union .
many political analysts credit the edge to schröder ’ s widely popular anti-american stance regarding a war with iraq .
" poisoned atmosphere " in an interview with the financial times deutschland , u.s. national security advisor condoleeszza rice said germany had created " a poisoned atmosphere . "
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable " the daily die welt directed its criticism to the justice minister , whose remarks " illustrate not only a lack of understanding of american politics , society , mentality and history , " but " also cowardice in front of the voters and saddam hussein . "
the süddeutsche predicted that the minister ’ s statements would mean the end of her political carrier .
" in the event that schröder is re-elected , he would do right not to include däubler-gmelin in his cabinet . "
in hamburg , the president of the world jewish congress , israel singer , described the hitler comparison as " without tact , thoughtless , and shocking . "
speaking to the mass-circulation bild , he said , " after the legislative elections in germany , whoever wins them , consequences should be drawn from this affair .

the country ’ s prominent papers as well as germany ’ s jewish community condemned däubler-gmelin for remarks made during an election campaign speech earlier in the week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.09.2002 german-american relations at all-time low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were better days for us-german friendship comments made by the german justice minister likening president bush to hitler have upset leaders in washington .
despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "

during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .

despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "

during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.09.2002 german markets hope for turn-around großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german stock exchange continues to suffer heavy losses german stock exchanges have been rocked by a mix of middle east tensions , an insolvency epidemic and a struggling u.s. economy .
the federal election is unlikely to succeed in turning things around . disappointing economic figures from the united states and europe last week sent the already downward trend on the german stock market even further into the basement , where the benchmark dax index had lost almost 9 percent in the week ’ s trading .
to compound matters , the looming possibility of a us-led attack on iraq has caused traders to become more cautious with investment .
the overall tendency is to hold back on buying and sell when you can .
technology branch hit hard in the midst of this general slump , the german technology branch , the hardcore of the dax , has suffered especially high losses .
recent figures published by the german association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- show that the industry is at the lowest point in two years .
bitkom had initially expected the sector to grow in 2002 , but software and it services are no longer driving economic expansion .
instead , the figures indicate an overall decline of 1.3 percent .
" germany is internationally at the bottom of the field , " bernhard rohleder , director of bitkom , announced on friday upon releasing the latest numbers .
the situation is not much better in other countries .
" but france , italy and scandinavia are at least reaching growth of about two percent " while germany slides into the negative digits .
nearly every sector is in the red , he said .
as a result of the decline , for the first time since the early 1990s , the number of jobs in the it branch has gone down .
the technology group fears that if the trend continues some 28,000 it sector employees in germany may lose their jobs .
what ’ s needed now , bitkom says , is a political framework that encourages the development of the it and communication sector so that it can achieve its full potential in germany .
election has little impact on markets but most market observers say the outcome of sunday ’ s election is unlikely to result in new economic impulses .
it ’ s not uncertainty over a change in government that is causing the stocks to slide and investment to slump ; it ’ s the poor economic conditions around the world .
" whether it ’ s a red-green -lsb- social democrats and greens -rsb- or a conservative coalition , the problems remain , " christian recker , director for trading at merck , fink & co . , told dw-tv .
" when we see the first policy statements of the next government , we ’ ll have an idea of what ’ s in store . "

despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin surrounded by photographers at a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 .
during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .
u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "
when asked whether he hoped schröder would change his position if he is elected to a second term , wolfowitz replied , " i certainly hope so .

u.s. national security advisor condoleeza rice strongly criticized the comments .
in an interview published saturday in the financial times deutschland , rice said , " how can one mention hitler and the u.s. president in the same sentence ?
and above all , how can such a comment come from the mouth of a german when one considers the sacrifices made by the united states when it acted to liberate the germans from hitler . "
according to rice , germany had created a " poisoned atmosphere " between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany .
there have been things said which are totally unacceptable . "
throughout the united states , the media has focused on the story of the german justice minister ’ s comments and have questioned the future of german-american relations .
president bush has said he was " deeply troubled " by recent events in germany , including a staunch governmental opposition to a us-led war on iraq .
foreign policy in german elections the alleged hitler remarks have prompted charges from washington that schröder is exploiting anti-american sentiment to boost his campaign for re-election .
in the recent run-up to sunday ’ s national elections , the social democrats and their coalition partner the greens have been very vocal in their objection to a us-led war against iraq .
schröder ’ s refusal to back the united states in the event of a military operation is widely credited as helping push his party ahead of that of his conservative rival , edmund stoiber , who supports the united states .
foreign policy issues normally do not play a significant role in german elections , but this year germany ’ s position on iraq has risen to the forefront .
both the spd and the opposition bloc of cdu / csu have been quick to voice their opinion on germany ’ s responsibility in the war on terror and the role in iraq .
the spd has taken an active non-military approach , refusing to join a possible us-led strike on iraq even with a un mandate .
by doing so , the party -lrb- which in the past voted to send troops to afghanistan and kosovo -rrb- , has drawn on a significant number of pacifist voters .
the conservatives have been more adamantly in favor of supporting an international military coalition led by the u.s. , and have criticized the schröder government for risking german-american relations for the sake of gaining a few more votes .
meanwhile u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz criticized schröder for jeopardizing the international coalition against iraq .
in an interview on cologne-based deutschlandfunk radio , wolfowitz said , " if un diplomacy is to succeed , it seems to me it ’ s very important that the iraqi regime sees itself confronted with a unified world .
i think the demonstrations of disunity are harmful to achieving a kind of political outcome that i believe everybody would like to achieve . "

despite an apology from chancellor schröder , relations between the two countries remain tense . with just two days before german national elections and a race too close to call , chancellor gerhard schröder has written to u.s. president george w. bush to apologize for the " supposed remarks " made by his justice minister , herta däubler-gmelin , who is said to have compared bush ’ s political methods over iraq to those of hitler .
the justice minister , a well-respected member schröder ’ s ruling social democrats , has repeatedly denied that she had made such a comparison , as presented in a local german newspaper earlier in the week .
däubler-gmelin claims she only said that some of president bush ’ s critics believe he is trying to distract from domestic problems by focusing on iraq , a tactic she said germany experienced directly under hitler .
any reference to a direct comparison between bush and hitler is a misquoting of her statements , she said .
chancellor schröder has accepted his justice minister ’ s explanation that she was misquoted in the newspaper reports .
" the minister has assured me that she did not make the remarks attributed to her , " schröder wrote in a personal letter to president bush on friday .
" i would like to make it clear to you how much i regret that through the supposed remarks of the german justice minister an impression was left that could deeply injure your feelings . "
" let me assure you that there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal , " schröder said , according to a german text provided by the chancellor ’ s office .
what exactly did she say ?
in a press conference friday evening , däubler-gmelin denied likening bush to hitler .
she insisted that the report published in the schwäbisches tagblatt after an election meeting with metalworkers misrepresented her actual statements and that it was " an evil election maneuver " by the conservative opposition .
the local paper quoted the justice minister as saying , " bush wants to divert attention from domestic political problems .
that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin surrounded by photographers at a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 .
during the press conference , the minister attempted to set the record straight , but instead appeared to jumble her denial by admitting she had indeed talked about the way bush ’ s foreign policy could divert attention from domestic problems .
she then added , " the discussion went back and forth and i said , that ’ s something we know from our own history since adolf nazi . "
clearly a reference to hitler , many present at the press conference believe the minister ’ s statements confirm the comparison originally reported .
but däubler-gmelin rejected that view , " it is absurd and slanderous to connect me to a comparison between a democratically elected politician and nazi leaders .
i deeply regret that this has thrown shadows on german-american relations , and i am here to clear that up . "
the conservative opposition of christian democrats and the christian social union have rejected the justice minister ’ s explanation and have called for her immediate dismissal .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the csu also voiced his criticism , saying that the spd was harming germany ’ s reputation abroad .
" every day , every hour that unspeakable woman keeps her post and represents germany damages germany greatly . "
strained german-american relations the remarks attributed to the justice minister have angered a u.s. administration already upset about chancellor schröder ’ s vocal – and very popular – opposition to american plans for a war against iraq .

police originally said the three medical students , who are us citizens of arab descent , had been overheard in a diner plotting an attack , before driving off at high speed through toll booths without paying .
now the authorities have admitted their conversation was not about terrorism and that cctv footage has shown they did in fact stop and pay the toll .
the whole incident has angered muslims , who have not ruled out taking legal action on the men 's behalf .
police swooped the video footage just released shows the three men driving normally and stopping to pay the toll just before being surrounded by police and arrested .
originally officers in florida had said the men had been overheard in a diner by a customer plotting a terrorist attack on miami .
police say their car was then spotted driving at high speed through toll booths without paying .
but the video now disproves that .
the arrest of the men last week gripped america .
they were held for 17 hours while 600 policemen were drafted into the area .
national television even carried live pictures of their car being searched by sniffer dogs and robots .
a bag was taken out and blown up but nothing was found and the men were released without charge .
muslim anger for muslim groups , the police 's admission has come too late .
speaking at a news conference , altaf ali , chairman of the council on american islamic relations , says the whole incident was a complete over-reaction based on stereotypes .
he has not ruled out legal action .
the students - who have since been barred from the medical conference they were driving to because of the publicity - have said in a statement that as trainee doctors their aim in life is to help people , not hurt them .

the israeli army says it is not deliberately targeting the office building and that any firing inside the compound is a warning to suspected militants to give themselves up .
surrender demanded israel wants 20 men who are in the compound , including : tawfiq tirawi , west bank intelligence chief mahmud damra , head of mr arafat 's force 17 bodyguard members of mr arafat 's fatah movement more than 20 people have surrendered but they are not thought to include the senior security officials wanted by israel .
the offensive at the ramallah headquarters follows two suicide bombings by palestinians this week and israel says it will continue until the wanted men surrender .
however , the us has urged israel to use restraint .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said : " israel has the right to defend itself and to deal with security , but israel also has to bear in mind the consequences of action and israel 's stake in development of reforms in the palestinian institutions . "
mr arafat is reportedly unhurt by the firing , but was showered with dust when the shell hit , a palestinian photographer inside the office told reuters news agency .
demolition earlier , the israeli army destroyed an overhead walkway connecting mr arafat 's office to an adjoining building , and palestinian officials inside the compound say they fear the structure could collapse .
tank shelling and machine-gun fire can be heard around mr arafat 's compound as israeli helicopters hover overhead .
the men israel wants to surrender include the head of west bank intelligence , tawfiq tirawi , accused by israel of involvement in terrorist activities , and mahmud damra , the leader of mr arafat 's force-17 bodyguard .
television pictures from the scene have shown israeli troops blindfolding men and taking them away .
arafat 's ramallah compound known as the muqataa built by the british in the 1920s palestinians took control in 1994 year after oslo peace accords largely destroyed by israeli forces but palestinian officials said these were not those wanted by israel , only civilian employees and perhaps some of mr arafat 's guards .
mr arafat 's battered headquarters was described by a bbc correspondent at the scene , barbara plett , as resembling a lonely island in a sea of rubble .
the israeli army spent much of the day blowing up or bulldozing as many as nine buildings in the compound , and digging a trench around mr arafat 's offices .
israeli sources are talking about a long stay for the military , and the curfew in ramallah and other west bank towns has been tightened .
meanwhile , the sixth victim of israel 's latest suicide bombing - an 18-year-old british student - has died from wounds suffered in thursday 's attack on a tel aviv bus .
the ramallah siege coincided with two israeli army incursions into the gaza strip , with one group of soldiers advancing to the edge of gaza city and another penetrating an area near the towns of beit lahiya and beit hanun .
at least three palestinians - a man , a woman and a teenage boy - were killed by the israeli fire .
chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat appealed to the international community to stop the israeli " aggression " and accused israeli prime minister ariel sharon of trying to destroy the peace process .
at the united nations in new york , the palestinians called for immediate measures to stop the attack on the compound .
mr arafat is said to be unhurt , but a palestinian cabinet minister described him as " angry " .
when told that israeli bulldozers were tearing down a fence , mr arafat " became tense , pulled out his little machine-gun and ran to fight the israelis outside , " the labour minister , ghassan al-khatib , told reuters news agency .
" his aides and bodyguards ran after him and forced him back , " he added .
israeli defence minister binyamin bin-eliezer told army radio that israel had " no intention " of firing at mr arafat or expelling him from the west bank .
for much of the past year , the palestinian leader has been confined in ramallah , with most of his compound already destroyed .
israel 's cabinet met for a full emergency session for the first time in six months on thursday night and decided to " isolate " mr arafat .
but the question of expelling the palestinian leader was apparently dropped on the grounds that it would do israel more harm than good .

there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the american president and such a criminal gerhard schroeder 's letter to george w bush but mr schroeder said he believed justice minister herta daeubler-gmelin 's denial of newspaper reports of her comments .
she said she had been misquoted and had made no link between mr bush and the nazi leader .
the reported comments had already caused a diplomatic stir .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said the president was " very angered " , while mr bush 's national security adviser condoleezza rice spoke of a " poisoned atmosphere " in relations between the two countries .
" i would say that just now is not a happy time for our relations with germany ...
the comments by the justice minister , even if she only said half of what is alleged , are unacceptable , " she said .
mr schroeder 's apology came as he entered the final days of campaigning before germany 's nail biting general election .
