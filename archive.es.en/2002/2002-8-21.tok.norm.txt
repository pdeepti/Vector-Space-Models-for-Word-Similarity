it is these contacts which may prove an important asset for current bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , the christian democrats ’ chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
foreign policy may not necessarily be stoiber 's strong point , but neither is he an amateur in this field .
during his visit to the united states earlier this year , stoiber made his priorities clear : the conservative opposition aims at maintaining a steadfast relationship with the united states . what may seem like the continuation of a policy that has existed since the german federal republic was founded after world war ii , does in fact have one new element : if elected , stoiber has conceded he will make more money available in the federal budget for the strengthening of the role of germany and europe in the transatlantic relationship .
criticism of the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military in their joint election policy platforms earlier this year , the christian democrats criticized the growing defense technology gap between europe and the u.s. , in particular the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military .
all in all , stoiber wants more money to modernize europe 's military capacities .
he argues that germany 's financial contribution to the european union 's common defense policy should match its political and economic weight in the eu , which is considerably larger than its military pull .
no troops for a u.n. middle east mission ?
on the deployment of german troops abroad , stoiber has said he has no general objections but has indicated he is against sending troops to the middle east .
his position , therefore , differentiates clearly from that of chancellor gerhard schröder .
schröder has disclosed that he would consider a bundeswehr deployment to the middle east under limited circumstances .
support of german minorities in eastern europe in addition , stoiber 's foreign policy differs from that of his social democrat counterpart in another foreign policy area with important historical significance : his ongoing support of german minorities in eastern european countries .
ealier this year , stoiber called for the lifting of the so-called benes decree in the czech republic , which was formulated by exiled czechoslovak president edvard benes during world war ii , and led to the expulsion of 2.5 million sudeten germans from what was then czechoslovakia after the war . stoiber said if the czech republic did not repeal the decree , the country should be barred from eu membership .
his counterpart schröder , however , has been careful not to take too strong stand on an issue which is still somewhat of a taboo topic in german politics .
increased weight in europe the christian democrats ' chancellor candidate has also lamented what he describes as " germany 's loss of influence in europe " .
he specifically accuses germany 's current government , led by schröder , of dragging its feet with france , once the country 's closest eu ally .
stoiber has said he will seek to reinvigorate the relationship if he is elected .

but developments abroad soon forced gerhard schröder to take a stand . from the allied bombing of yugoslavia to the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york , all these events contributed to the increasing weight of german foreign policy in current german politics .
but unlike many other political issues – such as the economy – most germans support schröder 's decision-making when it comes to the country 's relations with the rest of the world . eu , russia and the u.s. most germans believe germany should continue its current course of maintaining a strong role in both the european union and nato , while at the same time expanding relations with russia . a key point in germany 's foreign policy is its tight relationship with the united states , to which germany pledged " unlimited solidarity " after the september 11 terrorist attacks .
since that tragic day , germany has sent numerous troops to take part in the us-led war against international terrorism , operation enduring freedom .

four of these five military deployments were ordered under schröder 's leadership as chancellor . " germany ca n't shirk its increased responsibility in the world , " schröder said earlier this year , defending the dramatic increase of german army soldiers participating in foreign military deployments . currently , close to 10,000 german troops are engaged in missions abroad – including some major missions beyond europe ’ s borders .
curbing violence – in some cases using counter-violence – and crisis prevention – take the deployment of german troops to macedonia- have become key components of german security policy .
even in the middle east , schröder has not – at least not on principle - ruled out the possibility of military deployment . military budget cuts as part of its 2002-2006 government programme , the spd has pledged to expand its common military policies with the european union as well as the strength of the role of eu member states within nato .
however , germany has discouraged its nato partners with successive cuts in defense spending .
with the government pledging to balance its budget by 2006 , few anticipate the german military , the bundeswehr , will receive any windfall spending . instead , schröder wants to focus new spending on development policies .
the spd 's election platform specifically states that by 2006 it will make 0.33 percent of its gross national product available to fight poverty in developing nations .

it is these contacts which may prove an important asset for current bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , the christian democrats ’ chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
foreign policy may not necessarily be stoiber 's strong point , but neither is he an amateur in this field .
during his visit to the united states earlier this year , stoiber made his priorities clear : the conservative opposition aims at maintaining a steadfast relationship with the united states . what may seem like the continuation of a policy that has existed since the german federal republic was founded after world war ii , does in fact have one new element : if elected , stoiber has conceded he will make more money available in the federal budget for the strengthening of the role of germany and europe in the transatlantic relationship .

all in all , stoiber wants more money to modernize europe 's military capacities .
he argues that germany 's financial contribution to the european union 's common defense policy should match its political and economic weight in the eu , which is considerably larger than its military pull .
no troops for a u.n. middle east mission ?
on the deployment of german troops abroad , stoiber has said he has no general objections but has indicated he is against sending troops to the middle east .
his position , therefore , differentiates clearly from that of chancellor gerhard schröder .
schröder has disclosed that he would consider a bundeswehr deployment to the middle east under limited circumstances .

ealier this year , stoiber called for the lifting of the so-called benes decree in the czech republic , which was formulated by exiled czechoslovak president edvard benes during world war ii , and led to the expulsion of 2.5 million sudeten germans from what was then czechoslovakia after the war . stoiber said if the czech republic did not repeal the decree , the country should be barred from eu membership .
his counterpart schröder , however , has been careful not to take too strong stand on an issue which is still somewhat of a taboo topic in german politics .

he specifically accuses germany 's current government , led by schröder , of dragging its feet with france , once the country 's closest eu ally .
stoiber has said he will seek to reinvigorate the relationship if he is elected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.08.2002 europe 's secret scent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may soon know what 's in a perfume without having to rely on their olfactory senses .
the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

but unlike many other political issues – such as the economy – most germans support schröder 's decision-making when it comes to the country 's relations with the rest of the world . eu , russia and the u.s. most germans believe germany should continue its current course of maintaining a strong role in both the european union and nato , while at the same time expanding relations with russia . a key point in germany 's foreign policy is its tight relationship with the united states , to which germany pledged " unlimited solidarity " after the september 11 terrorist attacks .
since that tragic day , germany has sent numerous troops to take part in the us-led war against international terrorism , operation enduring freedom .
at the same time , it has also sent german soldiers to serve in the international security force maintaining peace in and helping to rebuild afghanistan . in addition , germany has troops deployed in three countries in the balkans regions .
four of these five military deployments were ordered under schröder 's leadership as chancellor . " germany ca n't shirk its increased responsibility in the world , " schröder said earlier this year , defending the dramatic increase of german army soldiers participating in foreign military deployments . currently , close to 10,000 german troops are engaged in missions abroad – including some major missions beyond europe ’ s borders .
curbing violence – in some cases using counter-violence – and crisis prevention – take the deployment of german troops to macedonia- have become key components of german security policy .
even in the middle east , schröder has not – at least not on principle - ruled out the possibility of military deployment . military budget cuts as part of its 2002-2006 government programme , the spd has pledged to expand its common military policies with the european union as well as the strength of the role of eu member states within nato .
however , germany has discouraged its nato partners with successive cuts in defense spending .
with the government pledging to balance its budget by 2006 , few anticipate the german military , the bundeswehr , will receive any windfall spending . instead , schröder wants to focus new spending on development policies .
the spd 's election platform specifically states that by 2006 it will make 0.33 percent of its gross national product available to fight poverty in developing nations .
germany currently spends 0.27 percent of gnp on development aid .
the international goal agreed upon decades ago is 0.7 percent of gdp , a fact the party 's election platform does not shy away from . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.08.2002 europe 's secret scent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may soon know what 's in a perfume without having to rely on their olfactory senses .
the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

it is these contacts which may prove an important asset for current bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , the christian democrats ’ chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
foreign policy may not necessarily be stoiber 's strong point , but neither is he an amateur in this field .
during his visit to the united states earlier this year , stoiber made his priorities clear : the conservative opposition aims at maintaining a steadfast relationship with the united states . what may seem like the continuation of a policy that has existed since the german federal republic was founded after world war ii , does in fact have one new element : if elected , stoiber has conceded he will make more money available in the federal budget for the strengthening of the role of germany and europe in the transatlantic relationship .

all in all , stoiber wants more money to modernize europe 's military capacities .
he argues that germany 's financial contribution to the european union 's common defense policy should match its political and economic weight in the eu , which is considerably larger than its military pull .
no troops for a u.n. middle east mission ?
on the deployment of german troops abroad , stoiber has said he has no general objections but has indicated he is against sending troops to the middle east .
his position , therefore , differentiates clearly from that of chancellor gerhard schröder .
schröder has disclosed that he would consider a bundeswehr deployment to the middle east under limited circumstances .

his counterpart schröder , however , has been careful not to take too strong stand on an issue which is still somewhat of a taboo topic in german politics .

he specifically accuses germany 's current government , led by schröder , of dragging its feet with france , once the country 's closest eu ally .
stoiber has said he will seek to reinvigorate the relationship if he is elected .

deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecoms company , announced massive losses on wednesday .
but the stock market reacted friendly as the company 's interim chairman promised a strict savings course . deutsche telekom posted first-half losses of more than 3.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.82 billion -rrb- on wednesday , as new interim chairman helmut sihler vowed to hold a strict savings course at europe 's largest telecoms company . " there are no sacred cows , " sihler said at the press conference announcing the earnings .
" everything is being evaluated . "
sihler , who replaced chairman ron sommer last month , plans to cut telekom 's debt from 65 million euro to 50 million euro by the end of next year .
a chronicle of mass layoffs foretold the plans include more than 20,000 job cuts and the possible sale of american wireless company voicestream to the u.s. wireless firm cingular .
voicestream , acquired by sommer during the height of the booming telecoms market two years ago , is valued at 10 billion euro .
at the time , telekom snapped it up for $ 51 billion -lrb- 51.96 billion euro -rrb- , or nearly five times as much .
the 3.9 billion euro losses for the first half of 2002 are 11 times more than losses in the first half of 2001 , but were in line with analysts forecasts .
telekom stock rose 0.5 percent on the frankfurt stock exchange after wednesday 's announcement to just under 12 euros .
sihler would n't speculate on the specific measures he had planned to trim the debt pile .
he also said the search for a long-term successor to sommer would only begin at the end of september . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.08.2002 europe 's secret scent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may soon know what 's in a perfume without having to rely on their olfactory senses .
the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

but developments abroad soon forced gerhard schröder to take a stand . from the allied bombing of yugoslavia to the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york , all these events contributed to the increasing weight of german foreign policy in current german politics .
but unlike many other political issues – such as the economy – most germans support schröder 's decision-making when it comes to the country 's relations with the rest of the world . eu , russia and the u.s. most germans believe germany should continue its current course of maintaining a strong role in both the european union and nato , while at the same time expanding relations with russia . a key point in germany 's foreign policy is its tight relationship with the united states , to which germany pledged " unlimited solidarity " after the september 11 terrorist attacks .
since that tragic day , germany has sent numerous troops to take part in the us-led war against international terrorism , operation enduring freedom .
at the same time , it has also sent german soldiers to serve in the international security force maintaining peace in and helping to rebuild afghanistan . in addition , germany has troops deployed in three countries in the balkans regions .
four of these five military deployments were ordered under schröder 's leadership as chancellor . " germany ca n't shirk its increased responsibility in the world , " schröder said earlier this year , defending the dramatic increase of german army soldiers participating in foreign military deployments . currently , close to 10,000 german troops are engaged in missions abroad – including some major missions beyond europe ’ s borders .
curbing violence – in some cases using counter-violence – and crisis prevention – take the deployment of german troops to macedonia- have become key components of german security policy .

however , germany has discouraged its nato partners with successive cuts in defense spending .
with the government pledging to balance its budget by 2006 , few anticipate the german military , the bundeswehr , will receive any windfall spending . instead , schröder wants to focus new spending on development policies .
the spd 's election platform specifically states that by 2006 it will make 0.33 percent of its gross national product available to fight poverty in developing nations .

it is these contacts which may prove an important asset for current bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , the christian democrats ’ chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
foreign policy may not necessarily be stoiber 's strong point , but neither is he an amateur in this field .
during his visit to the united states earlier this year , stoiber made his priorities clear : the conservative opposition aims at maintaining a steadfast relationship with the united states . what may seem like the continuation of a policy that has existed since the german federal republic was founded after world war ii , does in fact have one new element : if elected , stoiber has conceded he will make more money available in the federal budget for the strengthening of the role of germany and europe in the transatlantic relationship .
criticism of the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military in their joint election policy platforms earlier this year , the christian democrats criticized the growing defense technology gap between europe and the u.s. , in particular the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military .
all in all , stoiber wants more money to modernize europe 's military capacities .
he argues that germany 's financial contribution to the european union 's common defense policy should match its political and economic weight in the eu , which is considerably larger than its military pull .
no troops for a u.n. middle east mission ?
on the deployment of german troops abroad , stoiber has said he has no general objections but has indicated he is against sending troops to the middle east .
his position , therefore , differentiates clearly from that of chancellor gerhard schröder .
schröder has disclosed that he would consider a bundeswehr deployment to the middle east under limited circumstances .
support of german minorities in eastern europe in addition , stoiber 's foreign policy differs from that of his social democrat counterpart in another foreign policy area with important historical significance : his ongoing support of german minorities in eastern european countries .
ealier this year , stoiber called for the lifting of the so-called benes decree in the czech republic , which was formulated by exiled czechoslovak president edvard benes during world war ii , and led to the expulsion of 2.5 million sudeten germans from what was then czechoslovakia after the war . stoiber said if the czech republic did not repeal the decree , the country should be barred from eu membership .
his counterpart schröder , however , has been careful not to take too strong stand on an issue which is still somewhat of a taboo topic in german politics .
increased weight in europe the christian democrats ' chancellor candidate has also lamented what he describes as " germany 's loss of influence in europe " .
he specifically accuses germany 's current government , led by schröder , of dragging its feet with france , once the country 's closest eu ally .
stoiber has said he will seek to reinvigorate the relationship if he is elected .

it is these contacts which may prove an important asset for current bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , the christian democrats ’ chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
foreign policy may not necessarily be stoiber 's strong point , but neither is he an amateur in this field .
during his visit to the united states earlier this year , stoiber made his priorities clear : the conservative opposition aims at maintaining a steadfast relationship with the united states . what may seem like the continuation of a policy that has existed since the german federal republic was founded after world war ii , does in fact have one new element : if elected , stoiber has conceded he will make more money available in the federal budget for the strengthening of the role of germany and europe in the transatlantic relationship .
criticism of the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military in their joint election policy platforms earlier this year , the christian democrats criticized the growing defense technology gap between europe and the u.s. , in particular the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military .
all in all , stoiber wants more money to modernize europe 's military capacities .
he argues that germany 's financial contribution to the european union 's common defense policy should match its political and economic weight in the eu , which is considerably larger than its military pull .
no troops for a u.n. middle east mission ?
on the deployment of german troops abroad , stoiber has said he has no general objections but has indicated he is against sending troops to the middle east .
his position , therefore , differentiates clearly from that of chancellor gerhard schröder .
schröder has disclosed that he would consider a bundeswehr deployment to the middle east under limited circumstances .
support of german minorities in eastern europe in addition , stoiber 's foreign policy differs from that of his social democrat counterpart in another foreign policy area with important historical significance : his ongoing support of german minorities in eastern european countries .
ealier this year , stoiber called for the lifting of the so-called benes decree in the czech republic , which was formulated by exiled czechoslovak president edvard benes during world war ii , and led to the expulsion of 2.5 million sudeten germans from what was then czechoslovakia after the war . stoiber said if the czech republic did not repeal the decree , the country should be barred from eu membership .
his counterpart schröder , however , has been careful not to take too strong stand on an issue which is still somewhat of a taboo topic in german politics .
increased weight in europe the christian democrats ' chancellor candidate has also lamented what he describes as " germany 's loss of influence in europe " .

the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

but developments abroad soon forced gerhard schröder to take a stand . from the allied bombing of yugoslavia to the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york , all these events contributed to the increasing weight of german foreign policy in current german politics .
but unlike many other political issues – such as the economy – most germans support schröder 's decision-making when it comes to the country 's relations with the rest of the world . eu , russia and the u.s. most germans believe germany should continue its current course of maintaining a strong role in both the european union and nato , while at the same time expanding relations with russia . a key point in germany 's foreign policy is its tight relationship with the united states , to which germany pledged " unlimited solidarity " after the september 11 terrorist attacks .
since that tragic day , germany has sent numerous troops to take part in the us-led war against international terrorism , operation enduring freedom .
at the same time , it has also sent german soldiers to serve in the international security force maintaining peace in and helping to rebuild afghanistan . in addition , germany has troops deployed in three countries in the balkans regions .
four of these five military deployments were ordered under schröder 's leadership as chancellor . " germany ca n't shirk its increased responsibility in the world , " schröder said earlier this year , defending the dramatic increase of german army soldiers participating in foreign military deployments . currently , close to 10,000 german troops are engaged in missions abroad – including some major missions beyond europe ’ s borders .

however , germany has discouraged its nato partners with successive cuts in defense spending .
with the government pledging to balance its budget by 2006 , few anticipate the german military , the bundeswehr , will receive any windfall spending . instead , schröder wants to focus new spending on development policies .
the spd 's election platform specifically states that by 2006 it will make 0.33 percent of its gross national product available to fight poverty in developing nations .

it is these contacts which may prove an important asset for current bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , the christian democrats ’ chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
foreign policy may not necessarily be stoiber 's strong point , but neither is he an amateur in this field .
during his visit to the united states earlier this year , stoiber made his priorities clear : the conservative opposition aims at maintaining a steadfast relationship with the united states . what may seem like the continuation of a policy that has existed since the german federal republic was founded after world war ii , does in fact have one new element : if elected , stoiber has conceded he will make more money available in the federal budget for the strengthening of the role of germany and europe in the transatlantic relationship .
criticism of the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military in their joint election policy platforms earlier this year , the christian democrats criticized the growing defense technology gap between europe and the u.s. , in particular the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military .
all in all , stoiber wants more money to modernize europe 's military capacities .
he argues that germany 's financial contribution to the european union 's common defense policy should match its political and economic weight in the eu , which is considerably larger than its military pull .
no troops for a u.n. middle east mission ?
on the deployment of german troops abroad , stoiber has said he has no general objections but has indicated he is against sending troops to the middle east .
his position , therefore , differentiates clearly from that of chancellor gerhard schröder .
schröder has disclosed that he would consider a bundeswehr deployment to the middle east under limited circumstances .
support of german minorities in eastern europe in addition , stoiber 's foreign policy differs from that of his social democrat counterpart in another foreign policy area with important historical significance : his ongoing support of german minorities in eastern european countries .
ealier this year , stoiber called for the lifting of the so-called benes decree in the czech republic , which was formulated by exiled czechoslovak president edvard benes during world war ii , and led to the expulsion of 2.5 million sudeten germans from what was then czechoslovakia after the war . stoiber said if the czech republic did not repeal the decree , the country should be barred from eu membership .
his counterpart schröder , however , has been careful not to take too strong stand on an issue which is still somewhat of a taboo topic in german politics .
increased weight in europe the christian democrats ' chancellor candidate has also lamented what he describes as " germany 's loss of influence in europe " .
he specifically accuses germany 's current government , led by schröder , of dragging its feet with france , once the country 's closest eu ally .
stoiber has said he will seek to reinvigorate the relationship if he is elected .
he also says he will support russian reform efforts and will allow himself to " speak openly " and honestly if the reform process gets held up .

it is these contacts which may prove an important asset for current bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , the christian democrats ’ chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
foreign policy may not necessarily be stoiber 's strong point , but neither is he an amateur in this field .
during his visit to the united states earlier this year , stoiber made his priorities clear : the conservative opposition aims at maintaining a steadfast relationship with the united states . what may seem like the continuation of a policy that has existed since the german federal republic was founded after world war ii , does in fact have one new element : if elected , stoiber has conceded he will make more money available in the federal budget for the strengthening of the role of germany and europe in the transatlantic relationship .

all in all , stoiber wants more money to modernize europe 's military capacities .
he argues that germany 's financial contribution to the european union 's common defense policy should match its political and economic weight in the eu , which is considerably larger than its military pull .
no troops for a u.n. middle east mission ?
on the deployment of german troops abroad , stoiber has said he has no general objections but has indicated he is against sending troops to the middle east .
his position , therefore , differentiates clearly from that of chancellor gerhard schröder .
schröder has disclosed that he would consider a bundeswehr deployment to the middle east under limited circumstances .

but developments abroad soon forced gerhard schröder to take a stand . from the allied bombing of yugoslavia to the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york , all these events contributed to the increasing weight of german foreign policy in current german politics .
but unlike many other political issues – such as the economy – most germans support schröder 's decision-making when it comes to the country 's relations with the rest of the world . eu , russia and the u.s. most germans believe germany should continue its current course of maintaining a strong role in both the european union and nato , while at the same time expanding relations with russia . a key point in germany 's foreign policy is its tight relationship with the united states , to which germany pledged " unlimited solidarity " after the september 11 terrorist attacks .
since that tragic day , germany has sent numerous troops to take part in the us-led war against international terrorism , operation enduring freedom .
at the same time , it has also sent german soldiers to serve in the international security force maintaining peace in and helping to rebuild afghanistan . in addition , germany has troops deployed in three countries in the balkans regions .
four of these five military deployments were ordered under schröder 's leadership as chancellor . " germany ca n't shirk its increased responsibility in the world , " schröder said earlier this year , defending the dramatic increase of german army soldiers participating in foreign military deployments . currently , close to 10,000 german troops are engaged in missions abroad – including some major missions beyond europe ’ s borders .
curbing violence – in some cases using counter-violence – and crisis prevention – take the deployment of german troops to macedonia- have become key components of german security policy .
even in the middle east , schröder has not – at least not on principle - ruled out the possibility of military deployment . military budget cuts as part of its 2002-2006 government programme , the spd has pledged to expand its common military policies with the european union as well as the strength of the role of eu member states within nato .
however , germany has discouraged its nato partners with successive cuts in defense spending .
with the government pledging to balance its budget by 2006 , few anticipate the german military , the bundeswehr , will receive any windfall spending . instead , schröder wants to focus new spending on development policies .
the spd 's election platform specifically states that by 2006 it will make 0.33 percent of its gross national product available to fight poverty in developing nations .
germany currently spends 0.27 percent of gnp on development aid .
the international goal agreed upon decades ago is 0.7 percent of gdp , a fact the party 's election platform does not shy away from . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecoms company , announced massive losses on wednesday .
but the stock market reacted friendly as the company 's interim chairman promised a strict savings course . deutsche telekom posted first-half losses of more than 3.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.82 billion -rrb- on wednesday , as new interim chairman helmut sihler vowed to hold a strict savings course at europe 's largest telecoms company . " there are no sacred cows , " sihler said at the press conference announcing the earnings .
" everything is being evaluated . "
sihler , who replaced chairman ron sommer last month , plans to cut telekom 's debt from 65 million euro to 50 million euro by the end of next year .
a chronicle of mass layoffs foretold the plans include more than 20,000 job cuts and the possible sale of american wireless company voicestream to the u.s. wireless firm cingular .
voicestream , acquired by sommer during the height of the booming telecoms market two years ago , is valued at 10 billion euro .
at the time , telekom snapped it up for $ 51 billion -lrb- 51.96 billion euro -rrb- , or nearly five times as much .
the 3.9 billion euro losses for the first half of 2002 are 11 times more than losses in the first half of 2001 , but were in line with analysts forecasts .
telekom stock rose 0.5 percent on the frankfurt stock exchange after wednesday 's announcement to just under 12 euros .
sihler would n't speculate on the specific measures he had planned to trim the debt pile .
he also said the search for a long-term successor to sommer would only begin at the end of september . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

f. porsche ag on tuesday ventured onto the mass market with the launch of a new luxury sports utility vehicle , the cayenne , which analysts believe will bring a big boost to sales , with demand far outstripping the company ’ s traditionally cautious production targets .
the new cayenne production plant , which opened on tuesday in the east german city of leipzig , is geared towards the production of 40,000 cars per year .
for comparison : a total of 54,000 porsche model rolled off assembly lines last year .
the suv is set to retail at around 60,000 euros .
porsche officially foreast that annual production would reach 25,000 units a year .
but reports suggest that a letter to suppliers set out significantly higher targets .
moreover , chief executive wendelin wiedeking said at the opening of the 127 million euros plant that more than 100,000 people had signaled their interest in buying the new cayenne .
the new suv will be a direct competitor to bmw ’ s x5 and daimlerchrysler ’ s mercedes m-class .
but analysts believe the newcomer has big potential .
georg stürzer , car expert at hypovereinsbank , said the official production target represented “ a nice understatement ” .
stürzer expects the cayenne to become the main engine for porsche ’ s growth , and he forecast that total group sales would rise to more than 6 billion euros in the current business year from an estimated 4.7 billion euros in fiscal 2001/2002 , which ended 31 july 2002 .
stürzer said that growth in pretax profit could be even stronger , taking the full-year figure clearly above 900 million euros .
the analyst believes the porsche share has potential to rise to 630 euros from its current trading level of around 485 euros .
ceo wiedeking , meanwhile , was clearly sticking to his policy of delivering conservative forecasts in order to surprise the markets by exceeding targets .
he forecast a successful start of the cayenne and stable sales of porsche ’ s 911 and boxster models for the current business year .
“ we expect the sports cars to make a healthy contributions to earnings this year , ” he told handelsblatt .
for the year just ended , the ceo said the group was set to present a “ good result and good sales figures ” .
the porsche chief also said that concerns over new u.s. corporate governance rules had led the company to drop any plans to apply for a u.s. stock-market listing .
“ we will monitor the sec ’ s talks and wait for a result .
but to provide a sworn statement on the accuracy of balance sheets is not a real solution , ” he said .
after a string of major accounting scandals decimated several companies and undermined stock markets during the past year , the u.s securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- made it mandatory for chief executive officers to swear that their companies ' financial statements fairly and accurately reflect their financial condition . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it is these contacts which may prove an important asset for current bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , the christian democrats ’ chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
foreign policy may not necessarily be stoiber 's strong point , but neither is he an amateur in this field .
during his visit to the united states earlier this year , stoiber made his priorities clear : the conservative opposition aims at maintaining a steadfast relationship with the united states . what may seem like the continuation of a policy that has existed since the german federal republic was founded after world war ii , does in fact have one new element : if elected , stoiber has conceded he will make more money available in the federal budget for the strengthening of the role of germany and europe in the transatlantic relationship .

all in all , stoiber wants more money to modernize europe 's military capacities .
he argues that germany 's financial contribution to the european union 's common defense policy should match its political and economic weight in the eu , which is considerably larger than its military pull .
no troops for a u.n. middle east mission ?
on the deployment of german troops abroad , stoiber has said he has no general objections but has indicated he is against sending troops to the middle east .
his position , therefore , differentiates clearly from that of chancellor gerhard schröder .
schröder has disclosed that he would consider a bundeswehr deployment to the middle east under limited circumstances .

deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecoms company , announced massive losses on wednesday .
but the stock market reacted friendly as the company 's interim chairman promised a strict savings course . deutsche telekom posted first-half losses of more than 3.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.82 billion -rrb- on wednesday , as new interim chairman helmut sihler vowed to hold a strict savings course at europe 's largest telecoms company . " there are no sacred cows , " sihler said at the press conference announcing the earnings .
" everything is being evaluated . "
sihler , who replaced chairman ron sommer last month , plans to cut telekom 's debt from 65 million euro to 50 million euro by the end of next year .
a chronicle of mass layoffs foretold the plans include more than 20,000 job cuts and the possible sale of american wireless company voicestream to the u.s. wireless firm cingular .
voicestream , acquired by sommer during the height of the booming telecoms market two years ago , is valued at 10 billion euro .
at the time , telekom snapped it up for $ 51 billion -lrb- 51.96 billion euro -rrb- , or nearly five times as much .
the 3.9 billion euro losses for the first half of 2002 are 11 times more than losses in the first half of 2001 , but were in line with analysts forecasts .
telekom stock rose 0.5 percent on the frankfurt stock exchange after wednesday 's announcement to just under 12 euros .
sihler would n't speculate on the specific measures he had planned to trim the debt pile .
he also said the search for a long-term successor to sommer would only begin at the end of september . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it is these contacts which may prove an important asset for current bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , the christian democrats ’ chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
foreign policy may not necessarily be stoiber 's strong point , but neither is he an amateur in this field .
during his visit to the united states earlier this year , stoiber made his priorities clear : the conservative opposition aims at maintaining a steadfast relationship with the united states . what may seem like the continuation of a policy that has existed since the german federal republic was founded after world war ii , does in fact have one new element : if elected , stoiber has conceded he will make more money available in the federal budget for the strengthening of the role of germany and europe in the transatlantic relationship .
criticism of the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military in their joint election policy platforms earlier this year , the christian democrats criticized the growing defense technology gap between europe and the u.s. , in particular the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military .
all in all , stoiber wants more money to modernize europe 's military capacities .
he argues that germany 's financial contribution to the european union 's common defense policy should match its political and economic weight in the eu , which is considerably larger than its military pull .
no troops for a u.n. middle east mission ?
on the deployment of german troops abroad , stoiber has said he has no general objections but has indicated he is against sending troops to the middle east .
his position , therefore , differentiates clearly from that of chancellor gerhard schröder .
schröder has disclosed that he would consider a bundeswehr deployment to the middle east under limited circumstances .
support of german minorities in eastern europe in addition , stoiber 's foreign policy differs from that of his social democrat counterpart in another foreign policy area with important historical significance : his ongoing support of german minorities in eastern european countries .
ealier this year , stoiber called for the lifting of the so-called benes decree in the czech republic , which was formulated by exiled czechoslovak president edvard benes during world war ii , and led to the expulsion of 2.5 million sudeten germans from what was then czechoslovakia after the war . stoiber said if the czech republic did not repeal the decree , the country should be barred from eu membership .
his counterpart schröder , however , has been careful not to take too strong stand on an issue which is still somewhat of a taboo topic in german politics .
increased weight in europe the christian democrats ' chancellor candidate has also lamented what he describes as " germany 's loss of influence in europe " .
he specifically accuses germany 's current government , led by schröder , of dragging its feet with france , once the country 's closest eu ally .
stoiber has said he will seek to reinvigorate the relationship if he is elected .
he also says he will support russian reform efforts and will allow himself to " speak openly " and honestly if the reform process gets held up .
in addition he wants to anchor the german language more strongly into eu institutions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecoms company , announced massive losses on wednesday .
but the stock market reacted friendly as the company 's interim chairman promised a strict savings course . deutsche telekom posted first-half losses of more than 3.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.82 billion -rrb- on wednesday , as new interim chairman helmut sihler vowed to hold a strict savings course at europe 's largest telecoms company . " there are no sacred cows , " sihler said at the press conference announcing the earnings .
" everything is being evaluated . "
sihler , who replaced chairman ron sommer last month , plans to cut telekom 's debt from 65 million euro to 50 million euro by the end of next year .
a chronicle of mass layoffs foretold the plans include more than 20,000 job cuts and the possible sale of american wireless company voicestream to the u.s. wireless firm cingular .
voicestream , acquired by sommer during the height of the booming telecoms market two years ago , is valued at 10 billion euro .
at the time , telekom snapped it up for $ 51 billion -lrb- 51.96 billion euro -rrb- , or nearly five times as much .
the 3.9 billion euro losses for the first half of 2002 are 11 times more than losses in the first half of 2001 , but were in line with analysts forecasts .
telekom stock rose 0.5 percent on the frankfurt stock exchange after wednesday 's announcement to just under 12 euros .
sihler would n't speculate on the specific measures he had planned to trim the debt pile .
he also said the search for a long-term successor to sommer would only begin at the end of september . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.08.2002 europe 's secret scent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may soon know what 's in a perfume without having to rely on their olfactory senses .
the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .

but developments abroad soon forced gerhard schröder to take a stand . from the allied bombing of yugoslavia to the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york , all these events contributed to the increasing weight of german foreign policy in current german politics .
but unlike many other political issues – such as the economy – most germans support schröder 's decision-making when it comes to the country 's relations with the rest of the world . eu , russia and the u.s. most germans believe germany should continue its current course of maintaining a strong role in both the european union and nato , while at the same time expanding relations with russia . a key point in germany 's foreign policy is its tight relationship with the united states , to which germany pledged " unlimited solidarity " after the september 11 terrorist attacks .
since that tragic day , germany has sent numerous troops to take part in the us-led war against international terrorism , operation enduring freedom .
at the same time , it has also sent german soldiers to serve in the international security force maintaining peace in and helping to rebuild afghanistan . in addition , germany has troops deployed in three countries in the balkans regions .
four of these five military deployments were ordered under schröder 's leadership as chancellor . " germany ca n't shirk its increased responsibility in the world , " schröder said earlier this year , defending the dramatic increase of german army soldiers participating in foreign military deployments . currently , close to 10,000 german troops are engaged in missions abroad – including some major missions beyond europe ’ s borders .
curbing violence – in some cases using counter-violence – and crisis prevention – take the deployment of german troops to macedonia- have become key components of german security policy .
even in the middle east , schröder has not – at least not on principle - ruled out the possibility of military deployment . military budget cuts as part of its 2002-2006 government programme , the spd has pledged to expand its common military policies with the european union as well as the strength of the role of eu member states within nato .
however , germany has discouraged its nato partners with successive cuts in defense spending .
with the government pledging to balance its budget by 2006 , few anticipate the german military , the bundeswehr , will receive any windfall spending . instead , schröder wants to focus new spending on development policies .
the spd 's election platform specifically states that by 2006 it will make 0.33 percent of its gross national product available to fight poverty in developing nations .
germany currently spends 0.27 percent of gnp on development aid .
the international goal agreed upon decades ago is 0.7 percent of gdp , a fact the party 's election platform does not shy away from . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

it is these contacts which may prove an important asset for current bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , the christian democrats ’ chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
foreign policy may not necessarily be stoiber 's strong point , but neither is he an amateur in this field .
during his visit to the united states earlier this year , stoiber made his priorities clear : the conservative opposition aims at maintaining a steadfast relationship with the united states . what may seem like the continuation of a policy that has existed since the german federal republic was founded after world war ii , does in fact have one new element : if elected , stoiber has conceded he will make more money available in the federal budget for the strengthening of the role of germany and europe in the transatlantic relationship .
criticism of the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military in their joint election policy platforms earlier this year , the christian democrats criticized the growing defense technology gap between europe and the u.s. , in particular the " emaciation " of germany ’ s military .
all in all , stoiber wants more money to modernize europe 's military capacities .
he argues that germany 's financial contribution to the european union 's common defense policy should match its political and economic weight in the eu , which is considerably larger than its military pull .
no troops for a u.n. middle east mission ?
on the deployment of german troops abroad , stoiber has said he has no general objections but has indicated he is against sending troops to the middle east .
his position , therefore , differentiates clearly from that of chancellor gerhard schröder .
schröder has disclosed that he would consider a bundeswehr deployment to the middle east under limited circumstances .

he specifically accuses germany 's current government , led by schröder , of dragging its feet with france , once the country 's closest eu ally .

the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecoms company , announced massive losses on wednesday .
but the stock market reacted friendly as the company 's interim chairman promised a strict savings course . deutsche telekom posted first-half losses of more than 3.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.82 billion -rrb- on wednesday , as new interim chairman helmut sihler vowed to hold a strict savings course at europe 's largest telecoms company . " there are no sacred cows , " sihler said at the press conference announcing the earnings .
" everything is being evaluated . "
sihler , who replaced chairman ron sommer last month , plans to cut telekom 's debt from 65 million euro to 50 million euro by the end of next year .
a chronicle of mass layoffs foretold the plans include more than 20,000 job cuts and the possible sale of american wireless company voicestream to the u.s. wireless firm cingular .
voicestream , acquired by sommer during the height of the booming telecoms market two years ago , is valued at 10 billion euro .
at the time , telekom snapped it up for $ 51 billion -lrb- 51.96 billion euro -rrb- , or nearly five times as much .
the 3.9 billion euro losses for the first half of 2002 are 11 times more than losses in the first half of 2001 , but were in line with analysts forecasts .
telekom stock rose 0.5 percent on the frankfurt stock exchange after wednesday 's announcement to just under 12 euros .
sihler would n't speculate on the specific measures he had planned to trim the debt pile .
he also said the search for a long-term successor to sommer would only begin at the end of september . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecoms company , announced massive losses on wednesday .
but the stock market reacted friendly as the company 's interim chairman promised a strict savings course . deutsche telekom posted first-half losses of more than 3.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.82 billion -rrb- on wednesday , as new interim chairman helmut sihler vowed to hold a strict savings course at europe 's largest telecoms company . " there are no sacred cows , " sihler said at the press conference announcing the earnings .
" everything is being evaluated . "
sihler , who replaced chairman ron sommer last month , plans to cut telekom 's debt from 65 million euro to 50 million euro by the end of next year .
a chronicle of mass layoffs foretold the plans include more than 20,000 job cuts and the possible sale of american wireless company voicestream to the u.s. wireless firm cingular .
voicestream , acquired by sommer during the height of the booming telecoms market two years ago , is valued at 10 billion euro .
at the time , telekom snapped it up for $ 51 billion -lrb- 51.96 billion euro -rrb- , or nearly five times as much .
the 3.9 billion euro losses for the first half of 2002 are 11 times more than losses in the first half of 2001 , but were in line with analysts forecasts .
telekom stock rose 0.5 percent on the frankfurt stock exchange after wednesday 's announcement to just under 12 euros .
sihler would n't speculate on the specific measures he had planned to trim the debt pile .
he also said the search for a long-term successor to sommer would only begin at the end of september . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .

" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .

deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecoms company , announced massive losses on wednesday .
but the stock market reacted friendly as the company 's interim chairman promised a strict savings course . deutsche telekom posted first-half losses of more than 3.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.82 billion -rrb- on wednesday , as new interim chairman helmut sihler vowed to hold a strict savings course at europe 's largest telecoms company . " there are no sacred cows , " sihler said at the press conference announcing the earnings .
" everything is being evaluated . "
sihler , who replaced chairman ron sommer last month , plans to cut telekom 's debt from 65 million euro to 50 million euro by the end of next year .
a chronicle of mass layoffs foretold the plans include more than 20,000 job cuts and the possible sale of american wireless company voicestream to the u.s. wireless firm cingular .
voicestream , acquired by sommer during the height of the booming telecoms market two years ago , is valued at 10 billion euro .
at the time , telekom snapped it up for $ 51 billion -lrb- 51.96 billion euro -rrb- , or nearly five times as much .
the 3.9 billion euro losses for the first half of 2002 are 11 times more than losses in the first half of 2001 , but were in line with analysts forecasts .
telekom stock rose 0.5 percent on the frankfurt stock exchange after wednesday 's announcement to just under 12 euros .
sihler would n't speculate on the specific measures he had planned to trim the debt pile .

the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .

the european union wants to bring clarity into one of the most secretive industries around : perfume .
manufacturers feel brussels is sticking its nose where it should n't . for generations , france 's perfumers have created new scents by measuring raw essences , blending them , taking a whiff , and readjusting the ingredients until finally , all the substances merged into the perfect scent .
what magical contents precisely go into the small bottle is the largest trade secret of any perfume creator - just as heavily guarded as the detailed make-up of coca cola .
the european union , however , wants to shed some light on this secret .
and the perfume industry is up in arms .
according to a new eu directive , consumers should not only be able to smell what scents are in perfumes and cosmetics , they should have definite knowledge of the contents before they purchase a product .
the move is aimed to prevent the spread of allergies through the expensive fragrances , the eu says .
the directive wants the percentage of lavender essence or rose oil , for example , to be printed on the bottle 's label .
another option would be a package leaflet like those included with medication .
" suicidal " for the perfume industry prodarom , the national association of fragrance manufacturers , is not happy with the move .
such interference by brussels " endangers the perfume industry , favors imitations and slows down the development of new scents , " prodarom president han-paul bodifée told the afp wire service .
he says that implementing the eu directive was also " utterly unrealistic , " considering that 100 to 150 essences are necessary for one single perfume .
bodifée adds that the rules would also be " suicidal " for the industry , as they made it easier for perfume to be successfully forged .
already today , product pirates are the toughest opponents of the traditional guild , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " chavez rose " the eu experts have their eyes - or noses - fixed mainly on 26 aromatic substances that are known to promote allergies , including 16 natural scents , mainly from plants like lavender , rose , orange or lemon .
brussels claims these should at least be mentioned in a warning on the bottles .
" but we will prove that the doses of these natural extracts , which are found in 90 percent of perfumes , are too slight to trigger allergies , " says bodifée .
looking for a compromise the large cosmetics and luxury goods companies , whose scents are manufactured in the southern french perfume metropolis of grasse , have anyway already called for reducing allergen scents or doing without them completely , bodifée notes .
most of the 58 perfume companies in grasse are owned by u.s. corporations , such as procter & gamble or johnson & johnson .
and they are taking the issue very seriously , last but not least because they fear astronomical compensation claims in their domestic markets .
but independent producers have also been researching for years on how to chemically treat scents in order to disarm the actual allergens .
the eu is expected to take up this debate again at the beginning of october .
until then , french manufacturers want to go through numerous natural essences with a fine-tooth comb and then present their objections in brussels .
the industry is hoping for a joint resolution , says bodifée , and in the end , a compromise which will preserve their most precious secret . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links prodarom the national association of fragrance manufacturers in grasse .

deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecoms company , announced massive losses on wednesday .
but the stock market reacted friendly as the company 's interim chairman promised a strict savings course . deutsche telekom posted first-half losses of more than 3.9 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.82 billion -rrb- on wednesday , as new interim chairman helmut sihler vowed to hold a strict savings course at europe 's largest telecoms company . " there are no sacred cows , " sihler said at the press conference announcing the earnings .
" everything is being evaluated . "
sihler , who replaced chairman ron sommer last month , plans to cut telekom 's debt from 65 million euro to 50 million euro by the end of next year .
a chronicle of mass layoffs foretold the plans include more than 20,000 job cuts and the possible sale of american wireless company voicestream to the u.s. wireless firm cingular .
voicestream , acquired by sommer during the height of the booming telecoms market two years ago , is valued at 10 billion euro .
at the time , telekom snapped it up for $ 51 billion -lrb- 51.96 billion euro -rrb- , or nearly five times as much .
the 3.9 billion euro losses for the first half of 2002 are 11 times more than losses in the first half of 2001 , but were in line with analysts forecasts .
telekom stock rose 0.5 percent on the frankfurt stock exchange after wednesday 's announcement to just under 12 euros .
sihler would n't speculate on the specific measures he had planned to trim the debt pile .
he also said the search for a long-term successor to sommer would only begin at the end of september . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- new £ 5 notes reissued news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : uk news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england n ireland scotland wales politics education business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk wednesday , 21 august , 2002 , 04:07 gmt 05:07 uk new £ 5 notes reissued the serial numbers should no longer rub off the bank of england is to restart distribution of the new £ 5 notes .
the notes have already been delivered to banks and post offices , and from wednesday morning are being made available to the public .
distribution of the notes was suspended just a week after their introduction in may , following complaints that their serial numbers could be rubbed off .
it was highly embarrassing for the bank , which had previously stated the note was the most secure ever produced .
it later ran tests which traced the problem to the fact that the ink had not dried properly , because of a new protective varnish that had been put on the notes just before the serial numbers were printed .
with the new version , the protective varnish will be applied only after the serial number has been printed on to the bank note .
the bank has altered the way the notes are printed a bank of england spokesperson said : " we 're confident we 've fixed the problem . "
the new notes are the same size and colour as the existing note but have extra security features , including a hologram .
victorian prison reformer elizabeth fry replaces george stephenson on the note , becoming only the second woman to appear on the back of an english banknote .
they are supposed to have a longer life span than the current " fivers " , which last on average less than one year .

according to the bank the serial numbers are not a key security feature , but merely give information about the note 's origin .

in july the total income from sales rose by 4.9 % compared to the same period last year .
the figures , from the scottish retail sales monitor , show that the rise is less than the 6.6 % increase reported for june .
the report also revealed a similar pattern in like-for-like sales , which are achieved through activities of companies which were operating in the same period last year .
some retail sectors performed better than others the rise in such sales in june was 2.1 % , compared to 4 % in the previous month .
patrick browne , who was involved with the report , said retailers had blamed wet weather for weakening sales .
he said : " july 's sales figures suggest a weakening of consumer confidence with sales performance returning to the weaker trading which retailers saw in april and may .
" july 's increases are still relatively healthy given the previous pattern of scottish retail sales , but the poor weather is still a dominant factor impacting on sales performance . "
he added that sellers had responded to the drop with more aggressive promotions and sales than was usual for the time of year .
alcohol sales the gap between sales in scotland and the rest of the uk also widened , with average sales across the uk increasing by 6.3 % in july .
amongst the various sectors , sales of alcohol were positive , although tourists did not spend the normally high amounts on malt whisky .
promotions helped drive sales in footwear and books , health and beauty products continued to sell well but department stores were reported to have suffered because customers were holding back on buying summer clothing .
the study was based on responses from a sample of retailers across scotland , with the results analysed by experts at the university of edinburgh and accountants kpmg .

the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- said it was seeking the immediate arrest of 21-year-old saud al-rasheed of riyadh .
the suspect , described as armed and dangerous , is not thought to be in the united states .
but in a separate development a man accused of providing fake identification documents to two of the hijackers in the attacks was arrested at kennedy airport in new york on tuesday .
mohamed el-atriss - a naturalised us citizen of egyptian origin - was detained by customs officials after his return from egypt , where he fled last month to avoid arrest .
he is accused of selling fake id cards to khalid almihdhar , who was on the plane that crashed into the pentagon , and abdulaziz alomari , one of militants who boarded the plane that flew into the north tower of the world trade center .
the authorities say they are not sure whether mr atriss , 43 , knew of the hijackers ' plans , and federal authorities have not filed any charges against him .
however , he is charged with conspiracy , and manufacturing and distributing fake documents , by authorities in passaic county in the state of new jersey .
he will be held without bail pending a court appearance on friday .
' armed and dangerous ' the fbi posted a photograph of mr al-rasheed on its website , taken from a passport issued in may 2000 and found among pictures of several of the hijackers .
" law enforcement agencies are requested to stop and detain al-rasheed and to contact their local fbi office , " the fbi statement said .
" he is considered armed and dangerous . "
the statement added that the alert was issued based on information developed over the last few days from material previously recovered during the war on terrorism .
it is not known how long the government possessed the material .
the fbi has issued several alerts over the year following the attacks but most have been warnings of new terrorist threats rather than wanted notices .

with tony blair a close supporter of the us president , americans would be shocked if he did not support military action against saddam hussein , says general wesley clark . "
it has n't really penetrated popular understanding in the us that there is some possibility the uk would n't be there with us " general wesley clark downing street has said iraq will be on the agenda in cabinet when ministers return from their holidays next month .
that is being seen as a victory for ministers like robin cook , who are said to have pressed for a full cabinet discussion on the issue .
high expectations the uk continues to say that action to stop iraq 's alleged build-up of weapons of mass destruction is neither imminent nor inevitable .
on tuesday , general clark , who was nato supreme allied commander europe , said the concerns of british opponents of an iraq war did " make the press " across the atlantic .
but he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " tony blair 's behaviour since september 11 has left americans automatically assuming he will back any decision taken by us president george bush .
" the support of britain is assumed .
i think it would be shocking if britain did not go along with the united states . "
americans have been impressed with mr blair 's support for their president in recent months .
general clark said : " i think it has n't really penetrated popular understanding in the united states that there is some possibility that the uk would n't be there with us . "
war alternatives there was a 65-70 % chance of american-led strikes on iraq , said the former military chief .
he argued that using international law and diplomatic pressure from the international community could achieve a " decisive result " in iraq without military action .
" we would have a much better result of not just taking down saddam hussein 's regime but in controlling proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in preventing the inflammation of the arab world and in dealing with the aftermath in iraq , " he added .
press reports have suggested commons leader mr cook is ready to spearhead opposition in the cabinet to military action .
last week deputy prime minister john prescott said there were differences of opinion over the issue but dismissed as " prattle " reports of a split .
downing street too has rejected reports that mr blair has blocked a cabinet debate about iraq .
divisions ?
on monday , a number 10 spokeswoman said iraq would be one of a " whole range of issues " to be covered when cabinet meetings restart next month .
the prospect of war is also expected to dominate labour 's annual conference in blackpool next month .
some reports have suggested chancellor gordon brown harbours doubts about a possible war with iraq , partly because of the effect it could have on the economy .
oil prices have already risen , with uncertainty over the middle east seen as the prime reason .
last weekend , former cabinet minister peter mandelson dismissed any suggestion the cost of action would make mr brown refuse to pay for it .
costs of war that view was questioned by conservative mp john maples , who was financial secretary to the treasury during the gulf war .
mr maples told bbc radio 4 's world at one programme on tuesday that mr brown would be contemplating the direct cost of war and how it could affect spending on public services , as well as its possible impact on the economy .
the gulf war cost the uk £ 2.5bn , although it was able to recoup about £ 2bn from other countries who did not contribute troops - something which might not happen again .
the treasury 's contingency fund for tackling emergencies currently stands at £ 2.1bn.

on tuesday , general clark , who was nato supreme allied commander europe , said the concerns of british opponents of an iraq war did " make the press " across the atlantic .
but he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " tony blair 's behaviour since september 11 has left americans automatically assuming he will back any decision taken by us president george bush .
clark thinks there can be a " decisive result " without war " the support of britain is assumed .
i think it would be shocking if britain did not go along with the united states . "
americans have been impressed with mr blair 's support for their president in recent months .
general clark said : " i think it has n't really penetrated popular understanding in the united states that there is some possibility that the uk would n't be there with us . "
war alternatives there was a 65-70 % chance of american-led strikes on iraq , said the former military chief .
he argued that using international law and diplomatic pressure from the international community could achieve a " decisive result " in iraq without military action .
robin cook is said to be worried about war " we would have a much better result of not just taking down saddam hussein 's regime but in controlling proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in preventing the inflammation of the arab world and in dealing with the aftermath in iraq , " he added .
press reports have suggested commons leader mr cook is ready to spearhead opposition in the cabinet to military action .
last week deputy prime minister john prescott said there were differences of opinion over the issue but dismissed as " prattle " reports of a split .
downing street too has rejected reports that mr blair has blocked a cabinet debate about iraq .
divisions ?
on monday , a number 10 spokeswoman said iraq would be one of a " whole range of issues " to be covered when cabinet meetings restart next month .
the prospect of war is also expected to dominate labour 's annual conference in blackpool next month .
some reports have suggested chancellor gordon brown harbours doubts about a possible war with iraq , partly because of the effect it could have on the economy .
oil prices have already risen , with uncertainty over the middle east seen as the prime reason .
last weekend , former cabinet minister peter mandelson dismissed any suggestion the cost of action would make mr brown refuse to pay for it .
costs of war that view was questioned by conservative mp john maples , who was financial secretary to the treasury during the gulf war .
mr maples told bbc radio 4 's world at one programme on tuesday that mr brown would be contemplating the direct cost of war and how it could affect spending on public services , as well as its possible impact on the economy .
the gulf war cost the uk £ 2.5bn , although it was able to recoup about £ 2bn from other countries who did not contribute troops - something which might not happen again .
the treasury 's contingency fund for tackling emergencies currently stands at £ 2.1bn.

one of britain 's low-cost airlines has been criticised by the advertising standards authority for running a misleading ad .
a poster for british midlands ' no-frills carrier bmibaby advertised one-way fares to dublin or murcia , in spain , for £ 25 , including taxes , when booked over the internet .
but the bottom of the advert said : " from east midlands airport , book online or call . "
a customer who wanted to fly to murcia contacted the asa after telephoning bmibaby and being told details about the advertised price were available only through the company 's website .
british midland confirmed the £ 25 fare was available only over the internet , and that prices booked by telephone started at £ 30 .
second complaint after carrying out an investigation , the asa said the poster failed to make the distinction clear and upheld the complaint .
it asked the airline to change the wording and told it to contact the advertising body set-up to prevent companies breaking the industry 's code of practice .
the decision is the second complaint about bmibaby upheld in the past three months .
it was criticised for an e-mail advertisement which did not make clear that travellers had to buy a return flight to get the quoted price .
complaints to the asa about no-frills airlines have reached 21 so far this year , up from 16 in the whole of 2001 .
on tuesday low-cost carrier ryanair was criticised by the air passengers ' watchdog the air transport users ' council -lrb- auc -rrb- for its standards of service .
ryanair came third behind british airways and air france .
but the auc said that it was especially worried about the budget airline which , it claimed , often displayed a poor attitude towards its customers .

labour 's glenys kinnock has written what her office has described as a " strongly-worded letter " to the president of georgia urging him to take immediate action to secure the release of the 57-year-old banker from cowbridge .
mr shaw was abducted by a gang in tblisi , the capital of the former soviet republic , on 18 june following a shoot-out .
georgia 's president , eduard shevardnadze - a personal friend of mr shaw - has demanded his top ministers find and free the british banker .
mrs kinnock 's letter comes amid speculation european union development aid for the country may be at stake unless there is progress in the investigation .
mr shaw had been working for a european union-sponsored agriculture development bank .
president shevardnadze said he may hold his ministers personally responsible if law enforcement agencies fail to locate mr shaw .
he is trying to deal with claims that high-profile politicians , along with criminals , are involved in georgia 's widespread kidnappings of foreign nationals .
despite assistance from london 's scotland yard specialists , attempts to find mr shaw , who was set to return to cowbridge after six years in georgia , have failed .
they included a police hunt-and-rescue operation across tbilisi on 26 june , when officials believed his kidnappers were holed up in a basement .
the georgian state security ministry has pledged a 15,000-lari reward - or £ 5,000 - for information about his whereabouts .
reports have indicated the kidnappers contacted police authorities to demand a us $ 2m ransom for mr shaw - a claim the uk foreign office refused to speculate upon .
mr shaw - originally from maesteg - took early retirement as a midland bank manager six years ago , then worked in azerbaijan and hungary .
he has three children in south wales - lisa , 30 , rhodri , 29 , and philip , 26 .
he had been in georgia since 1996 and was appointed team leader in 1999 for abgrobiznesbank , which gives loans to the agriculture sector under the eu-backed tacis programme .
ec external relations commissioner chris patten has called on georgian authorities to pursue the attackers " with the utmost rigour and urgency " .

the violence comes as military commanders from both sides are due to meet to discuss the implementation of a plan under which israeli forces will withdraw from palestinian population centres .
palestinian witnesses reported that up to 20 israeli tanks firing heavy machine-guns entered the khan yunis camp .
they said the israeli troops used megaphones to order residents to leave an area of the camp before blowing up a building , killing one person inside .
a soldier guarding the nearby jewish settlement of gadid was shot dead by a palestinian sniper on tuesday .
militant group hamas claimed responsibility for the shooting .
the israeli army said that during its wednesday morning operation , troops came under attack from explosives , grenades and gunfire .
its statement added that troops were ordered to " destroy abandoned houses that are used as shelter or as firing positions " by armed palestinians .
security plan monday night saw israeli troops withdraw from the west bank town of bethlehem , as well as nearby villages and dheishe refugee camp .
the withdrawal took place under the " gaza , bethlehem first " security plan concluded between israeli defence minister binyamin ben eliezer and palestinian interior minister abdelrazak al-yahya .
the plan foresees a progressive israeli withdrawal from land it has re-occupied during the 23-month palestinian intifada , or uprising , if the reformed palestinian security forces can ensure an end to militant attacks on israelis .
hours after the withdrawal from bethlehem , the brother of a leading palestinian militant was killed by israeli forces in the west bank town of ramallah .
mohammed saadat , 22 , brother of ahmad saadat , the jailed head of the popular front for the liberation of palestine -lrb- pflp -rrb- , was shot as he tried to resist an israeli special unit trying to capture him outside his home .

it is africa 's turn to chair the commission and the african union has now confirmed libya should take the lead role when the annual session begins next year .
the foreign office says the rules do not allow other nations to make their nominations for the role .
this month , mike o 'brien became the first uk minister to visit libya since 1983 .
' strong line needed ' diplomatic relations were broken off by the uk in 1984 after the murder of wpc yvonne fletcher but were resumed when libya handed over the lockerbie bomb suspects .
shadow international development secretary caroline spelman said her party cautiously welcomed moves towards better relations .
mike o 'brien made an historic visit to libya this summer " however , it would be wrong if these diplomatic manoeuvres prevented britain from taking a strong line against libya 's record of abusing fundamental human rights , " she said .
ms spelman has written to her counterpart , clare short , to campaign against handing control of the commission to libya .
in her letter , she says : " the commission on human rights is the un 's main human rights forum , but it has become dominated by the most serious human rights abusing countries in the world .
zimbabwe support " the commission will only be further discredited with libya in the chair . "
shadow foreign secretary michael ancram has written to his counterpart , jack straw , expressing similar concern .
we do hope that libya will use this high profile role to take steps to improve its human rights record foreign office spokeswoman mr ancram also highlighted colonel gaddafi 's support for robert mugabe , whose policies the tories say are wreaking havoc in zimbabwe .
libyan officials were " masters of violation of human rights " , mr ancram told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" it does seem alice in wonderland stuff , it 's like making a criminal a chief constable . "
campaign group human rights watch is also objecting to libya 's new role .
rory mungoven , the group 's global advocacy director , said : " libya 's long record of human rights abuses clearly does not merit such a reward . "
mr mungoven described the development as a real setback for african leaders ' stated new commitment to human rights .
the group says the libyan government has detained its opponents for years without trial , stopped other political parties being started and " muzzled the press " .
rights opportunity a foreign office spokeswoman told bbc news online that respect for human rights was needed for libya 's continued re-entry into the international community .
" we do hope that libya will use this high profile role to take steps to improve its human rights record , " said the spokeswoman .
jose diaz , from the office of un high commissioner for human rights , mary robinson , told today the un could not interfere with nominations .
the formal election of libya to the chair will not happen until the start of the commission 's meeting .
" we will have to see how it will actually turn out , " said mr diaz .
the uk government thought it important that there was continued british involvement with the commission and its work in promoting human rights , she added .
each year , the commission on human rights , set up in 1948 , meets for six weeks in geneva .
more than 3,000 delegates from un member states , as well as from other organisations , are involved in framing new resolutions designed to combat human rights abuses .

bollywood is establishing itself quite big now - it 's come at the right time jimi mistry graham , who starred in boogie nights and austin powers 2 , plays an " adult " film star who ramu meets after mistakenly attending a porn audition .
he inadvertently finds himself drawn into new york 's high society as a sex guru , using the philosophical maxims of his porn star friend .
graham used the gala night to stick up for british men , following the recent attack on their dating qualifications by actress gwyneth paltrow .
ant date paltrow said british men were often too afraid to ask her out and did not compare to american men when it comes to romance .
the film features bollywood dance numbers " i 've had a few english boyfriends and they were aggressive enough to ask me out , " said graham , who in the past dated 80s pop star adam ant .
she also said she was not worried about being typecast after starring as a porn actress in two films .
she said : " i think this is a really different film from boogie nights .
i thought maybe i should n't do it because its another porn actress but i 'd rather do a good film than worry about being typecast . "
the guru , which recently had its world première at edinburgh film festival , features bollywood dance routines as well as send-ups based on western stereotypes of asian men .
" it 's a good cross-over from indian culture to hollywood culture , " mistry told the bbc .
" it 's been building for a while , more films with indian subjects .
" bollywood is establishing itself quite big now .
it 's come at the right time . "
joyful mistry said the film mocked the " faddiness " of american culture and that he had put in 150 % into his performance .
" it 's a role where i think you have to be quite fearless . "
the sugababes attended the première mistry recently complained he had been offered roles only for asian actors , rather than a full range of parts .
graham said the film had kindled her interest in bollywood .
" it 's my dream to be in a musical .
" i knew about -lsb- bollywood -rsb- .
but they sent us some films .
they 're so great , so happy , singing joyful and over-the-top . "
at the after-show party at the elysium nightclub , graham and mistry took to the stage to entertain guests .
the actress danced while mistry sang hindi tunes from the film soundtrack .

" i tend to search around looking up history and geography sites and spend hours restoring family photographs . "
for mrs frances , the internet has an important lesson to teach her generation .

two-thirds of those surveyed did not have access to the internet and two-thirds of those had no intention of going online .
one factor which was persuading older people to get wired was those with friends and family overseas for whom the internet had become an invaluable way of staying in touch the survey found .
the study is part of a three-year partnership between age concern and barclays to bring technology to older people and ensure they are not excluded from the digital revolution .
the next phase will be to provide internet taster sessions at day centres and residential homes , starting in devon , gloucestershire , oxfordshire and enfield .

nothing new there .
with the corporation currently firing on all cylinders and the commercial world having a tough time , the bbc 's rivals have been queuing up to air their grievances .
what is notable has been the robustness of its response .
the first attack came from an unexpected source - the director of the broadcasting standards commission -lrb- bsc -rrb- .
paul bolt told the financial times that too many bbc programmes were " humdrum , over-familiar and formulaic " , singling out for criticism the popular dramas mersey beat and holby city .
" one begins to wonder what really is the point of the bbc bringing this to us .
let 's have something a bit different .
" if the bbc is n't at the cutting edge , if the bbc is n't being original , trying to find new faces , new ideas , constantly refreshing itself with new things , then people will tire of it .
on-buttons " people will say : ' why am i paying my licence fee if this is what they 're doing ? " '
before joining the bsc , mr bolt was a senior civil servant at the department for culture , media and sport , helping set the government 's broadcasting policy .
his current job will disappear when the bsc is merged into the new single regulator ofcom and his remarks were widely seen as an attempt to strengthen his chances of a top position in the new set-up .
the bbc fired back with two barrels .
mal young , head of drama series , told the guardian : " this department was built on z cars , juliet bravo , and all creatures great and small .
" popular drama has always been singled out for criticism , but people are increasingly voting with their on-buttons . "
and in a letter for publication , head of drama jane tranter questioned whether bolt 's " patronising " remarks were in keeping with his role as an " objective and unbiased regulator " .
personal attack " his examples are also highly selective .
over the past 12 months the bbc has launched 17 brand new dramas on bbc one alone and our output has ranged from the bafta award-winning the way we live now via auf wiedersehen , pet and spooks to the more challenging crime and punishment . "
those responses were mild compared with the reply to monday 's attack on greg dyke by itv 's departing head of programmes .
david liddiment told the guardian dyke did not understand the bbc 's purpose and by concentrating on ratings and " not a lot else " he was " providing a terrible disservice to range and quality and cultural values in britain " .
asked if dyke was the right person to lead the bbc , liddiment said " i do n't think so " - a line the paper interpreted as " saying he is unfit to hold the position " .
the bbc 's response was just as personal .
" we 're disappointed that david liddiment is going , given his effect on itv 's performance .
we feel rather sorry for him .
" having presided over the most disastrous period in itv 's history , he 's desperate to blame anyone but himself for the channel 's failures . "
ouch .
liddiment will be returning fire at this weekend 's edinburgh television festival .
and no doubt the bbc 's top tv executives will be firing back .

he added : " we are hoping to take this forward now and hopefully in five to seven years it could lead to a new class of drugs . "
the study is published in the journal of biological chemistry .

boat engineer ri kyong-song , 33 , told south korean officials that he had been detained against his will and wanted to be reunited with his family in the north .
mr ri walked back into north korea on wednesday , passing through the truce village of panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone separating the two koreas .
" long live our great general ! "
mr ri called out as he crossed , referring to the north 's leader kim jong-il , the 20 other north koreans have sought asylum in the south .
the group had left north korea by boat on saturday and spent two days at sea before being intercepted by south korean maritime officials .
it was the first direct maritime defection between the two koreas in five years .
tied up south korean officials said mr ri had made it clear that he was forced to travel to the south against his will and wanted to join the rest of his family in the north .
he told investigators that he had been imprisoned and tied up on the boat by other families who wanted to defect from the communist state .
the head of the north korean red cross had urged officials in the south to allow mr ri 's swift return on humanitarian grounds .
both nations still remain technically at war , and share one of the world 's most heavily fortified land frontiers .
but despite the difficulties , the number of north koreans reaching the south and seeking asylum continues to roughly double each year .
nearly 600 have defected to the south this year , escaping food shortages and political repression in the north .
aid groups estimate that tens of thousands of north koreans are sheltering illegally in china , which shares a porous border with the north .
beijing does not recognise them as refugees and has tended to send those caught back to north korea .
