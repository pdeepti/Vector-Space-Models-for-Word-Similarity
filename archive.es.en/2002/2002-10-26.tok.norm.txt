us leaders designated jemaah islamiah as a terror group earlier in the week the ruling binds all member countries of the un to freeze any assets belonging to jemaah islamiah , prevent it obtaining weapons and bar its members from international travel .
jemaah islamiah is the leading suspect in the bombing of an nightclub on the indonesian island of bali two weeks ago which killed nearly 200 people , most of them australians .
the un 's move comes after the australian government lodged an application earlier this week to the un security council for jemaah islamiah to be listed as a terrorist group with links to osama bin laden 's network .
vigilance call its request was accompanied by a document with detailed evidence of those links .
the move was supported by some 50 other countries and has now formally come into effect after the required two-day period during which objections could be presented .
none were , and therefore starting immediately , all member countries of the un are instructed to freeze the assets of jemaah islamiah , ensure that it does not acquire any weapons and prevent its members from travelling between one country and another .
several asian and european countries had already begun to implement these measures , even before this un ruling .
on wednesday , the united states designated jemaah islamiah a terrorist group under us law .
the australian government also this week issued an international warning for extra vigilance , concerned that this move by the un could spark a violent reaction from some supporters of the group .
