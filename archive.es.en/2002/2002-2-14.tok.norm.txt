hp posted a net profit of $ 484m for the november-to-january quarter , an almost fourfold rise on the same period a year earlier , and roughly one third more than analysts had predicted .
the company said that the results proved it had the clout and financial muscle to integrate takeover target compaq , whose results have been weaker in recent quarters .
the hp-compaq merger , which would create the world 's biggest computer firm , has been opposed by some analysts and key shareholders , who accuse hp chief executive carly fiorina of expensive empire-building .
hp 's soaring profits results will sharpen the appetite of investors for results from current market leader dell , due out later on thursday .
cheap computers hp said that strong personal computer sales to businesses and consumers returned the total pc business to profit , and that digital imaging and outsourcing showed strength .
the firm has recently lost some ground in the highly competitive pc market , where dell 's aggressive pricing strategy has won it market share .
outside pcs , hp has been criticised for its failure to spot the shift towards it services , something that tech giant ibm has been quick to exploit .
chief financial officer bob wayman said hp 's two-and-a-half year campaign of cost cutting was finally paying off .
" we have been working and working on getting expenses sized to the changed environment , " he said .
' decisive step ' ms fiorina , whose hold on the top job has been threatened by the merger wobbles , said the results were a vindication of her policies .
" our execution these past two quarters demonstrates that we 're ready to take this decisive step .
we know our business better than anyone else , " she said .
investors ' worries that customers would see the merger plans as a cue to jump ship to hp 's rivals had been proved groundless , she said .
but sceptics over the merger , who include director and founding family heir walter hewlett , argue that strong profits prove that hp can prosper without compaq , whose pc business is heavily focused on the low-margin end of the market .
hp shares jumped by about 5 % in after-market trading , but remain down some 10 % since the merger was announced at the end of august .
most of its hi-tech rivals have enjoyed relatively perky share-price performance in the past few months .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- valentine test for princess tie-up categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 14 february , 2002 , 06:27 gmt valentine test for princess tie-up carnival sets out to seduce princess shareholders a three-way takeover battle raging around cruise line operator p & o princess is set to take a decisive turn at a st valentine 's day shareholders ' meeting .
uk-based p & o princess , the world 's second-biggest cruise ship operator , is keen to complete a planned £ 7bn -lrb- $ 4.8bn -rrb- merger with third-ranked royal caribbean in order to shore up its position as global tourist spending slumps .
meanwhile , us-based carnival , the biggest cruise company of all , has launched a hostile £ 3.8bn takeover bid for princess , winning the support of some of its shareholders .
but while carnival 's latest offer is pitched high enough to seem attractive , the company has not quite dispelled fears that its takeover attempt is a spoiling tactic aimed at breaking up the princess / caribbean merger , thereby preserving its own market dominance .
against this backdrop of suspicion and uncertainty , the success or failure of princess ' merger ambitions will be determined at an extraordinary shareholders ' meeting at the royal lancaster hotel in london on thursday .
shareholder mutiny ?
the purpose of the meeting is to hold a vote on whether or not to proceed with the royal caribbean merger , but princess shareholders interested in tying up with carnival instead are expected to propose a motion to postpone a final ballot .
carnival , which is offering 550p per princess share - well above their current price of about 407p - revealed on monday that investors holding 29 % of princess 's stock plan to vote in favour of postponing the royal caribbean vote .
share of european cruise market carnival 9 % royal caribbean 6 % princess 25 % this is some way short of the outright majority needed to secure an adjournment , but the announcement has upped the ante in the takeover battle .
successfully putting off the royal caribbean vote would give princess shareholders more time to weigh up carnival 's rival bid .
it would also delay a final decision until after competition watchdogs in europe and the us have decided whether or not there are grounds for blocking either deal .
regulatory uncertainty all along , princess ' main objection to the carnival bid has been that it would be less likely to obtain regulatory clearance , especially in europe .
however , some observers argue that this depends on whether the european commission assesses the impact of the proposed mergers on the cruise liner market , or on the wider market for holidays .
if the commission chooses the holiday market as its benchmark , then both mergers are expected to gain clearance .
cruises have enjoyed strong growth in recent years but if it makes its decision by reference to the luxury cruise market , the institution is thought more likely to impose conditions on the carnival / princess merger due to its greater market share .
however , obtaining complete regulatory clearance for the princess / royal tie-up will not be plain sailing either .
last month , the uk 's office of fair trading referred the princess / royal merger to the competition commission .
supporters of the carnival bid believe that the uk probe undermines princess 's claim that the tie-up with royal carries less regulatory risk , and strengthens the case for adjourning thursday 's vote .
royal gamble an adjournment , although not enough in itself to blow the princess / caribbean merger off course , would greatly strengthen carnival 's hand .
it would give carnival - currently banned under uk takeover panel rules from upping its bid again until after the 14 february meeting - an opportunity to put together a more tempting offer .
more importantly , any firm sign that princess is starting to consider alternative offers could prompt royal - which has already shown signs of impatience at princess 's new dalliance - to pull out of the original merger deal .
a leading member of royal 's board said last week that he would consider a vote for an adjournment to be " tantamount to a vote for carnival . "
princess would , of course , prefer to keep its options open .
if royal walked away , and an alternative tie-up with carnival deal was then blocked by regulators , the company would be back to square one , probably leaving shareholders nursing hefty losses .
on the other hand , it is by no means certain that royal would pull out in the event of an adjournment .
royal , whose smaller size means that it is even more vulnerable to the slowdown in global tourism spending , may decide that it would be better to swallow its pride and wait in the hope that the regulator 's verdict goes its way .
but the st valentine 's day vote provides a good example of how an investment decision can sometimes resemble a gamble .

we were told by the president -lsb- castro -rsb- that we could expect to see additional purchases of food jim summer , usa poultry and egg export council last december , cuba bought $ 35m of wheat , soya beans , rice and corn in the wake of hurricane michelle , which devastated the island 's crops .
it was the first time cuba directly imported us products , despite an american trade embargo which had been in place for 40 years .
although washington eased trade restrictions slightly in 2000 , mr castro refused to buy american products because of continuing limitations on us businesses .
after the hurricane , president bush agreed to speed up the licensing process for american firms wishing to sell to cuba , so that food could reach cuba quickly .
change of mind cuba had said the first purchase would not be repeated unless america further eased the embargo .
but , after a six-hour meeting with president castro , the us delegation said cuba had dropped its demands .
castro wants us trade laws lifted " we were advised by president castro that there is still a need for humanitarian product .
he indicated he would like to re-establish the reserves to help them recover from hurricane michelle and also to help in case of future emergency situations , " said jim summer , president of the us poultry and egg export council .
mr summer said mr castro wanted to buy about the same amount as the first order .
mr castro said cuba would be willing to buy three times that amount if existing restrictions on the financing of sales were lifted , mr summer said .
under a new deal in 2000 , us firms were permitted to sell directly to the island , but public or private funding for the sales was prohibited .
mr castro said if remaining limitations on licences to sell food to cuba were lifted , us trade could eventually account for more than half the island 's food supply , said mr summer .
however , us congress has said the embargo will remain in place until cuba improves human rights and makes democratic reforms .

and one part of the love business that has always remained buoyant is the romantic novel .
on valentine 's day 2001 , a new publisher launched in the uk , determined to make inroads into the romance market traditionally dominated by mills and boon . "
i really thought there was a gap in the market " mary-jo wormell , heartline books such is the cut-throat nature of the market in love stories that heartline books prepared its debut in secret and gave away its first book , love is forever , for free .
one year on and heartline founder mary-jo wormell is pleased with progress .
" we have published or are publishing 40 books , and we 've got more than 35 authors - half well-established , half brand new - which is really exciting , " she told bbc news online .
ms wormell is herself a mills and boon author , with some 40 books to her credit under the pseudonym mary lyons .
" i 'd been doing it for 20 years , it was almost like a career change - i just thought , ' do i want to keep doing this all the time ? '
" i thought there was room for slightly longer books , and i wanted to get rid of the couple in a clinch on the cover , so that you could actually read the books on the tube or on the bus without people thinking , ' she 's reading a sloppy romance ' . "
if there is a rivalry with her old employer , it is something which ms wormell plays down .
" compared to them we are a minnow and i wo n't knock them - i wrote for them for 20 years and was happy to do so .
" we 're no threat to mills and boon and we do n't even pretend to be , we 're just giving another outlet to writers . "
ms wormell is keen to stress that heartline is striving to be author-friendly .
royalties " i 've been an author long enough to know how dreadful it is , sitting there with a computer , the hours and hours of silence .
" we ran our contracts past mark le fanu at the society of authors .
" we do n't give a one-off fee , we do proper contracts , with advances on acceptance and the second part of their advance on publication , and they 're paid royalties twice a year . "
but , she noted with regret , so far all of her authors are women .
" i 'd love to have a man writer , but we just have n't had the right one yet , " she said . "
you definitely have to have an upbeat ending " mary-jo wormell , heartline books the readership of romantic novels is still dominated by women too , though she does claim a constituency of what she calls " closet male readers " .
but heartline is making efforts to break some of the stereotypes of what romantic fiction is about .
" we write about divorcees , single parents feature quite a lot and in fact most writers tend to want to write about modern conditions , things they know about .
" and we do have women falling in love with a married man .
" but our stories do end happily - though it might well be that instead of wedding bells , the girl feels ' that was a romance , it was fine ' and now she 's got her act together , and tomorrow 's another day .
" you do n't necessarily have to go off into the sunset together but you definitely have to have an upbeat ending . "
sex rears its ugly head , too - but heartline 's founder maintains this is not as revolutionary as it sounds .
" there 's a myth about mills and boon-type novels that the chap has a pipe in his mouth and a jutting chin and just says , ' i love you , cynthia ' - in fact they 've been bouncing around on beds for some time .
" we take exactly the same line as all romantic fiction publishers , which is that sex has to come from within the story . "
human nature but ms wormell believes the present-day preoccupation with sex can be misleading .
" we all want love , this is a fundamental need - people have not changed .
" we put on this veneer of cleverness and jokiness but underneath everyone wants to be loved , everyone wants to have the right relationship - that is part and parcel of human nature .
" we 've had the ' chick lit ' , and now we 're getting the ' chick lit with babies ' .
" but most readers are looking for escape , they 're looking for a good story , a damn good read . "
and a good story is what the heartline founder is still looking for , when it comes to her own reading tastes .
" persuasion by jane austen is one of my real favourites , but just give me a good story - i love all of jilly cooper 's . "
and ms wormell 's own view of romance ?
" my idea of a perfect valentine 's day is a candlelit dinner with george clooney , russell crowe - or perhaps sean bean , " she says .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- scotland : what do you think ?
categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 14 february , 2002 , 08:43 gmt scotland : what do you think ?
john o 'groats : a " tourist trap " ?
parts of scotland have been described in the latest edition of a travel guide as " grim " , " scarred " and " dismal " .
they are unwelcome words for a nation that promotes itself as picturesque and welcoming .
the frank views are expressed by researchers writing for the new version of the guide to scotland by lonely planet .
for example , dundee - which wants to be known as the city of discovery - is said to be " scarred by ugly blocks of flats and buildings joined by unsightly concrete walkways " .
is this concrete sprawl an accurate picture ?
glasgow is " surrounded by a grim hinterland ... of grey council houses " , according to the guide , while edinburgh is marred by " problems with drugs and prostitutes " .
john o 'groats , the most northerly tip of the uk mainland , is dismissed as " little more than a big car park and tourist trap " .
the guide also notes : " scots take their drinking seriously , spending an average 9 % of their weekly income on fags and booze " .
what do you think ?
are these views inaccurate or do they present a true reflection of scotland ?
where are your best and worst parts of the country ?
i arrived in edinburgh for a week 's visit , and stayed for 18 months .
scotland is the most beautiful country in the world -lrb- and i have travelled through quite a few ! -rrb- .
the country side is awesome , the architecture outstanding and the people fantastic .
what more should a country offer ?
fiona , australia i was absolutely captivated by scotland .
glasgow and edinburgh are so completely different and yet so close to each other .
i think glasgow is a really exciting city .
its crm buildings are breathtaking and the highlands , well words escape me .
i believe that if you look for depressing scenes in a country then you will find them maureen mcfarlane , usa of course parts of scotland are crap , as are parts of nz and i would have to agree with comments on dunoon and dundee i 'm afraid , but surely these places are n't high on the 10 day tourist list of things to see and do i found most of the people i encountered to be very friendly , extremely hospitable and very funny .
i love scotland and would go back in a heartbeat , if only i could get a job that paid enough to feed us but surely thats a whole other talking point .
anna , new zealand i have lived in the us , canada , and scotland and i believe that if you look for depressing scenes in a country then you will find them .
if drinking in scotland is an issue -lrb- i have not observed that -rrb- then what about the beer guzzling that goes on in north america ?
scots television does not revolve around beer commercials the way it does in the us .
if you find what you look for then i have found some of the nicest , most courteous people in all three countries .
the architecture in any large city leaves a great deal to be desired .
the unflattering remarks about dundee , a city that has far more than architecture to offer a tourist , is n't any worse than those tacky , small , coloured boxes of houses found on the hills of san francisco .
if you do n't like overcast misty weather then do n't go to scotland and stay off the northern california coast too .
i believe a reviewer should state what is to be found in a city and possibly what is to be avoided but , they should be objective .
maureen mcfarlane , usa i 've been all over scotland , and had great times throughout .
from the rugged hills of the highlands , to the spectacular streets of edinburgh , the whole place amazes .
i look forward to every trip back .
russell moore , england , uk as a third year student of human geography , i am well aware of the socio-economic problems , crime and unemployment afflicting the peripheries of scotland 's large cities .
for instance , wester hailes , edinburgh and easterhouse , glasgow .
go to a country like australia where people actually use litter bins and care about the way their cities look andy , edinburgh however , this says nothing about the genuine friendliness of the majority of scots towards visitors and i for one ca n't wait to return to beautiful edinburgh and eclectic glasgow .
and that 's to say nothing about the stunning countryside beyond loch lomond .
john , england i try and not waste my time responding to such rediculous comments .
every city / country has its good areas and bad areas .
people should do their homework before visiting any area .
all cities have the good and the bad .
its my home and i thank my lucky stars every day that it is .
caroline , scotland edinburgh is without doubt a beautiful city and i could n't see past it for many years .
but go to a country like australia where people actually use litter bins and care about the way their cities look and you will be frankly disgusted when you come home .
andy , edinburgh , scotland i 've only spent three days in scotland , but i have no complaints about my trip .
i found edinburgh to be fascinating and a pleasure to visit .
it 's easy to get around , has plenty of shops , cafes , restaurants and bars , and is as rich in culture and history as any major european city .
and , the people are as friendly as you 'll ever meet .
i 'm sure there were drugs and hookers around at the time , but ca n't say they made a significant impact on my overall scotland experience .
from the immortal words of douglas macarthur , " i shall return ... "
f.coleman , houston , texas quite frankly having travelled extensively around the world , i 've stopped bothering to buy lonely planet guides , because i 've found them to be largely unreliable , both in terms of hard facts as well as giving any background to the culture of a country .
i live in dundee .
but if you take a 15-minute drive from here you will get a paradise called arbroath abdullah yusuf secondly , as a scot from the " grey hinterland of council houses " , if you compare glasgow to somewhere like birmingham , glasgow 's a delightful place to go to , full of friendly people and lovely victorian architecture .
walk along st vincent 's street if you do n't believe me .
edinburgh i 'm not so keen on - but there you go , i 'm a good glesga boy .
robert mcgowan , london been going to scotland for 11 years on holiday .
it is a beautiful place , but i must admit describing wick as dismal is an understatement .
neil rushton , lancs , uk i live in dundee .
but if you take a 15-minute drive from here you will get a paradise called arbroath .
it wo n't be a " dejection : an ode " ; i promise .
life is beautiful there .
abdullah yusuf this sounds like a non-story to me .
is anyone surprised that the guide says that areas like north lanarkshire have some ugly towns ?
but the guide also praises the beautiful areas , like can be seen in http : / / www.loveofscotland.com / .
seems balanced to me .
craig w , uk i think we could write reports like that about any city in the world .
the train journey into barcelona take you through some pretty grim housing schemes .
the comment about john o 'groats however , is spot on , if ever i saw a site crying out to be a bomb range that is it .
gerry , scotland i think we could write reports like that about any city in the world .
gerry , scotland parts of scotland are indeed pretty grim , but most of the country is visually appealing .
add great golf , good shopping , stacks of culture , and you 've got a fantastic holiday destination .
the only downside is that i 've noticed increasingly high levels of anti-english sentiment in recent years .
john , england i have travelled overseas using lonely planet handbooks .
scotland is not unique in having the occassional adverse comment made about it .
given the time and money i would love to make -lrb- another -rrb- visit to scotland , warts ' n all .
it 's a beautiful country .
john , brit in us the book prides itself in ' telling it how it really is ' .
scoland is n't -lrb- and never was -rrb- brigadoon !
i do n't see that any of the comments are actually wrong .
people might not like what they say , but that 's a different matter .
this only really becomes an issue if it 's rather more generous about places outside scotland !
g dobie , uk -lrb- scotland -rrb- parts of scotland are indeed pretty grim , but most of the country is visually appealing. ere john , england scotland is 99 % beautiful countryside .
there are so few blackspots that it is easy to be specific .
england , on the otherhand , is rapidly becoming covered in concrete , industrial estates and traffic .
it 's easier to pick out the remaining beauty spots .
by the way , i 'm english .
helen , nottingham , england as a scot who lives away in holland , i am very proud of the country i come from .
i fly the st. andrews flag , and i tell people how wonderful scotland is at any chance i get .
most people here who have been to scotland loved it too .
tane piper , the netherlands scotland is one of the most beautiful places on earth .
among many other splendors , try the firth of forth at twilight .
chris field , us might be worth noting that the prostitutes in edinburgh have a lower rate of sexually transmitted diseases than the rest of the young female population in britain .
then again , perhaps we do n't want to see that in a tourist guide .
gordon , scotland i think the bbc is blowing this out of proportion and possibly taking the statement out of context .
the lonely planet guides , while i do n't agree with everything they say , make an effort to point out bad sides of town so that tourists do not find themselves in dangerous situations .
this is true in all the guides i 've purchased : sweden , paris , and yes , london .
they have a " dangers and annoyances " section which is designed to give a little wisdom to the otherwise naive tourist .
that 's it .
further , the scotland book -lrb- which i used last year when i visited the country -rrb- is written by a native of the country .
perhaps for this reason he feels comfortable pointing out what he sees as flaws .
meanwhile , i spent a week in glasgow and found the city and the people to be lovely .
scotland is one of the most beautiful places on earth .
here chris field , usa every city has some seedy elements , but overall i found glasgow to be both safe and embracing .
do n't take offense at what was probably one line out of an otherwise praise-filled volume .
jennifer ethington , usa i recently visited scotland for an entire month and thought it was the most beautiful place on earth .
edinburgh is one of the most enjoyable cities i 've ever visited with good restaurants , friendly people and so many lovely things to see .
the countryside and coastal areas are gorgeous and every square inch of the place is brimming with fascinating history to discover .
wondrous castles and gardens , skara brae , st. magnus cathedral - it 's all fabulous .
and there 's nothing wrong with john o 'groats .
i adore scotland - it 's wonderful and the people at lonely planet have no taste .
pay them no mind !
ashley jacobs , usa speaking as a sassenach , i think edinburgh is the coolest place on the planet , and i would love to live and work there -lrb- again -rrb- .
as it is , i just go there for a few days during the festival .
as for lonely planet - that 's a terribly dismal series of books .
i was thinking about the pacific north west for this year 's holiday , so i took out their guide from the library .
it makes gloomy and dismal reading , and i may have changed my mind !
john , uk as for lonely planet - that 's a terribly dismal series of books .
john , uk i have used several lonely planet guides in the past 10 years .
they offer some of the most up-to-date and reliable information available and are always my first purchase after booking a holiday .
in recent years i have noticed a distinct change to their style .
the guides have always contained information on the less savoury sides of countries .
this information was stated as a fact , and the reader had to make up their own mind .
in more recent books the comments have become more personal , therefore comments such as " the cities architecture is not very nice " , or , " a bus ticket is expensive " have morphosed into " scarred by ugly blocks of flats and buildings joined by unsightly concrete walkways " , and , " travellers will have to stop eating to afford the bus ticket " .
this is very disappointing and i hope that lonely planet begin to revert to their widely appreciated style of providing unbiased , accurate and useful information .
callum , norway , scots ex-pat scots have lost pride in their country .
the people are friendly , but they have lost that day to day care for scotland .
they no longer bother .
time to leave , and will the last person out please switch off the lights peter , uk / usa scots have lost pride in their country .
peter , uk in response to d vernon , england : it was in fact the new labour politicians , -lrb- scottish executive - run by london labour -rrb- , who ordered the use the tragedy of september 11th for tourist purposes in scotland and not the scottish tourist board .
but on the subject of the lonely planet guides - they also slate london in one of their guides too , so fairs fair !
mark shanks , scotland , uk scotland is god 's country - just beautiful - people are the most friendly that i 've ever met theresa smith , usa me and my wife visited the uk two years ago on our honeymoon .
all i can say is that we were largely disappointed until we reached the scottish border below edinburgh .
the days that we spent driving across the country and visiting the towns from edinburgh to islay were wonderful and we could n't have spent a better time .
i have seen much of the usa , western europe and bits of asia , none of these locales can rival the charm and beauty of scotland as a whole and the western isles in particular .
b currie , georgia , usa i have seen much of the usa , western europe and bits of asia , none of these locales can rival the charm and beauty of scotland b currie , georgia there are dozens of travelogues on the internet that tell a different story .
if you want to know what a country is like , read what the average traveller has written and not the media .
do n't worry about how your country is portrayed in lonely planet , i have fallen in love with it from all the information i have read and my fondest dream is to come to scotland .
gwen , usa i worked in the inner hebrides for a year and can vouch for the stunning beauty of the more thinly populated parts of scotland .
i do think it 's unfortunate that many of the scots people whom i met in urban areas seem to have turned drinking into a national sport .
one should perhaps remember that their national icon - robert burns - was himself a hopeless alcoholic , so perhaps it 's just a case of a poor choice of role model .
in their favour is the fact that the scots tend to be an evenly balanced people - although this might just be the result of having a chip on both shoulders .
unfair generalisations perhaps - but based on experiences which left me with these rather sour impressions .
chris b , england i do think it 's unfortunate that many of the scots people whom i met in urban areas seem to have turned drinking into a national sport .
chris b , england so what if edinburgh has drugs and prostitutes .
amsterdam seems to attract tourists .
edinburgh is a very rounded beautiful city .
john , edinburgh , scotland i wonder if the people who write such nonsense have ever actually been to scotland .
i now live in london but i still miss scotland dreadfully .
all countries have areas that are not the best to look at but i really do n't think that can be said of scotland .
i now live in london and people often tell me how beautiful and amazing they find our country .
sounds like someone is trying to be controversial to make up for their mundane writing ability .
dale graham , scotland my wife and i spent the most amazing hogmanay in edinburgh .
the celebrations were superb , the people , tourists and scots fantastic .
the fireworks amazing .
prostitutes , drugs , i did not see them .
edinburgh remains my favourite city and i would love to live there if i could find a job .
pascal jacquemain , uk what a revelation - towns in the uk with areas of bad housing , crime and drug abuse .
not as bad as london though !
give me scotland anytime - at least you do n't have a five-hour journey to see a hill or meet somebody friendly .
steve , uk i wonder if the people who write such nonsense have ever actually been to scotland .
dale graham , scotland i 'm in love with scotland where i often drive up to visit my friends in edinburgh and i resent scotland being described as " grim , scarred and dismal " .
of course scotland is n't perfect and you can find several sites which are merely tourist traps .
but this is the same things in many parts of europe and france in particular , where making money is the principal thing .
i have to say scottish people are friendly and as kind as possible .
and what to say about the splendour of the lanscape in the north , and the west of this lovely country ?
edinburgh and glasgow cetainly have problems with drug and prostitution , but do you know the situation in paris , london and other cities ?
it certainly is worse !
so do n't worry scotland , every year we will return .
patrice boutellier , france buck up , scotland !
take pride in yourself !
john a. , usa returning to the highlands after a 23-year absence , i was disapointed in what i saw .
i found my home town to be blighted with drugs and prostitution mainly in the areas with a high refugee content .
the parochial atitude abundant when i left is still very much in evidence .
when a town 's shops do n't open till 10 and almost eveything -lrb- except the pubs -rrb- close at six ; how do you expect to prosper !
buck up , scotland !
take pride in yourself !
john a. , usa there seems to be a concensus that it is you sad people in the media who are , as usual , jumping on the few negative aspects of a positive story .
if you were n't so excited at getting yourselves some catchy headlines , you would take more time to report what 's actually happening .
perhaps lonely planet should note some of our populations ' obsession with talking our country down and tell potential visitors to ignore it .
james , ccotland there 's an element of truth in the saying that ' travel narrows the mind ' , and it can often apply to writers of travel guides with their tendency for sweeping generalisations .
michael , scotland rather than criticising scottish cities for problems which are common to cities worldwide , my gripe about scotland as a tourist destination is the number of cafes , hotels and restaurants in more rural districts which still insist that they ca n't serve meals outwith strictly defined hours , with the result that a tourist can be denied a sandwich because he has arrived after 2pm .
good service is what attracts tourists and keeps them coming back .
a carmichael , scotland it 's good that the bad bits are being highlighted kirsten garrett edinburgh i think it 's only fair that a guide book give a balanced approach and it 's most unfair of us to expect only praise for the good bits and for the ' bad ' bits to be left out .
this is a beautiful country , and i love living and travelling here , but there are problems and we 'd be foolish and naive to ignore them .
it 's good that the bad bits are being highlighted .
maybe those who are in a position to make changes will sit up and do something .
i cringe sometimes when i see tourists whose enthusiasm for this amazing country turns to bewilderment and disappointment when they are faced with surly service and overinflated prices and these are the problems that need to be addressed .
kirsten garratt , edinburgh , scotland i think the descriptions are accurate .
the scots do drink and smoke too much and there is a hardcore of people who simply refuse to use a litter bin .
however , every country or location can be negatively described .
therefore if you want to truly appreciate scotland , then leave the towns behind and stay in the countryside .
you 'll be impressed .
garry brown , scotland nowhere is perfect .
we ca n't deny that some of our cities have bad spots , but that should not be presented as the whole story .
anyway , perhaps some " trainspotting " fans would rather visit some of edinburgh 's run-down areas than the castle .
i see an opening for " alternative " tourism !
allan forrester , scotland all the comments made seem fair enough to me and as a dundonian i ca n't really argue against both the comments made about my home city .
yes it is " scarred by ugly blocks of flats and buildings joined by unsightly concrete walkways " and yes the people are the " friendliest and most welcoming in scotland " .
however it would be nice to see if the guide has taken note of the vast improvements made to dundee city centre over the last few years .
stephen reid , scotland scotland has its problems , including the scottish cringe that you are demonstrating so well maz scotland it 's not lonely planet who are painting a bleak picture - it is the bbc who pick up a few isolated negative comments in the guide and blow them up into a non-existent attack on a beautiful country .
lonely planet are generally very positive about scotland , as they should be .
friends of mine from across europe are captivated by our country and return year after year .
as with every other tourist destination across the globe , scotland has its problems , including the scottish cringe that you are demonstrating so well .
but these are far outweighed by its beauty , the friendliness of the people and its vibrant culture .
that is the real story .
maz , scotland after visiting scotland for many years as a tourist and working out of aberdeen for a couple of years i used to love the country for its beauty and friendliness and recomended it as a destination .
unfortunately some years ago on my last holiday visit i came across an increasing racist attitude towards the english -lrb- including painted signs on overhead bridges " f * * * off english " -rrb- .
perhaps the scottish tourist board should address this attitude before using the tragedy of 11 september 11 to promote their hypocritcal tourist industry .
d vernon , england lonely planet should be more responsible before publishing superficial opinions without doing proper research and which reduce tourism in that wonderful country .
i hope others see the superficiality and lack of depth in lonely planet guides and stop purchasing them .
john paul , england i think these criticisms are justified .
instead of moaning about them , we should try and fix them dougal mckinnon scotland i took the trouble to read lonely planet 's website , rather than the handful of quotes dished up by the tabloid press .
i found it overwhelmingly positive about scotland , its people and its attractions .
so there are a handful of comments about scotland 's downside .
so what ?
are we trying to say that there are no problems here ?
it 's hardly a shock to have someone point out that edinburgh has trouble with drugs and prostitution , or that glasgow and dundee have some ugly buildings .
they do .
i think these criticisms are justified .
instead of moaning about them , we should try and fix them .
scotland is n't perfect .
dougal mckinnon , scotland i can only talk about edinburgh and leith -lrb- where i live -rrb- .
the two main points made are in relation to drugs and prostitution .
drugs - a visitor will not happen upon dealers etc.by accident , the visitor would have to have local knowledge and be guided to the source .
prostitution - as with drugs the visitor would not happen upon prostitutes by accident , he or she would have to actively seek them out in a -rrb- licensed saunas or b -rrb- " licensed " red light area in leith .
the impression given that edinburgh is overrun with both drugs and prostitution are false .
yes edinburgh does have its fair share of the above but so do many cities .
edinburgh is well policed and scaremonger stories from writers / journalists , who get their stories 2nd / 3rd hand from unreliable sources must take their share of the blame for stories that are proved false and that the majority of " normal " tourists would never encounter .
jim mcilwaine , scotland maybe the media would rather convince us that we live in a hovel which no-one in their right mind would want to visit ?
dave scotland yet again , the media concentrate on the negative side of a report .
by the media i mean newspapers and television , not organisations like lonely planet who merely tell it like it is , good or bad .
in this case , what is n't reported is the lonely planet 's praise of scotland .
in particular , as someone who works in dundee , i 've become used to sneering remarks about the city .
yes , we all know that there were some abominable town planning decisions taken in the 60s and 70s , yet the lonely planet balances these valid observations by also noting that dundee is recovering from these horrors by developing an attractive cultural scene , including a very successful repertory theatre and arts centre .
it also praises the city 's people as being amongst the friendliest in the country .
while i 'm not arguing everything 's perfect here , let 's at least acknowledge that there are lots of good things happening in scotland , and that these are things which should be attracting tourists .
but maybe the media would rather convince us that we live in a hovel which no-one in their right mind would want to visit ?
dave , scotland i 've no complaints .
looks all right to me .
besides the wonderful countryside i 've found most people to be welcoming .
this is a bit of a vague question to be honest .
for people to moan about grim council estates etc , they obviously have not travelled enough .
i 'ts like that everywhere in the uk where there is a large centre of population .
i 've lived in the south east of england all my life and despite the rumours of enormous wealth in that region it should be understood that although we are one of the richest countries in the world , that wealth is owned by a small number of people .
therefore there will be an abundance of less well-off individuals requiring ' affordable housing ' wherever you go .
it 's wrong to generalise .
anyway , edinburgh is a fantastic city and lets not forget glasgow 's elevated status to euro city of culture in recent years .
andy , england i feel that this article is not portraying the correct information .
whilst glasgow may be " surrounded by a grim hinterland ... of grey council houses " , i 'm sure that the guide also points out what the city has to offer - museums , archeticture , a stunning univeristy , some wonderful parks as well as a wealth of restaurants and bars .
i have used these guides extensively and they are correct to portray the darker side of any city .
i was particulary glad of the author 's real life point of view on shanghai , so why should it not be the same in my own country ?
claire smith , uk what a terrible thing to write about scotland .
i had two horrific holidays last year , both of which cost me a fortune .
i then spent three days in glasgow .
the weather was superb , the food fantastic , the city was not ugly plus the people were really really friendly .
londoners are totally miserable and if you want to take a trip to a drug-infested council estate then i suggest you go to limeside on the outskirts of oldham .
i used to live there and to be honest it is disgusting and makes london , glasgow , manchester and the rest look like a day in hyde park .
mel , uk i have been to scotland many times and i must say that john o 'groats may be not bigger than a parking lot but i have found beatiful scenery and an incredible amount of welcoming people .
lonely planet says about the same things also in the italian guide .
have you read about wick ?
laura gauna , italy lonely planet caters for spoiled rich kids , travelling the world on daddy 's money , pretending they have some affinity with the locals they exploit before going back to take some job with a multinational .
i think we can live without them .
john , scotland i 've visited a number of cities abroad and all of them are the same .
like scotland 's cities they all have their good and bad points with troublespots , areas of poverty and dilapidation .
as for john o 'groats , we advertise it as a tourist attraction but it also provides and excellent ferry service to the isles of orkney -lrb- which are worth a visit -rrb- .
david ferguson , scotland i was lucky enough to visit glasgow last weekend .
the scots were incredibly friendly , the town centre picturesque , the bars and clubs buzzing and the cultural scene vibrant -lrb- i especially recommend the museum of modern art -rrb- .
ca n't wait to visit edinburgh !
jon pascal , london , uk comments such as " drugs problem " and " scarred by grey council houses " can apply to any city within any country around the entire world .
as a tourist guide book , perhaps the lonely planet team should focus more on what tourists will choose to see and do during their visit to scotland - namely visit buildings of architectural interest and enjoy the countryside .
at the very least , can they please balance their comments with similar observations about london , birmingham , manchester .
gordon walker , uk i just wonder what the guide books have to say about other parts of the uk .
i doubt that they have as many nice things to say about england or wales .
neil , uk having spent a few years living in california i can tell you malibu and venice beach are n't that far from some dismal black spots too .
anaheim , home to disneyland , is bleaker than dundee and let 's not even go near bakersfield .
hollywood is no picture postcard either .
the difference is the people there are friendly in a very shallow manner .
scots are genuine and that 's why i was happy to return .
steve b , scotland while i have only read the comments published and not the guide in full , it does seem to be a fairly accurate description of the central belt of scotland and areas further a-field .
if visitscotland or anyone else for that matter believes that the all the council housing in scotland adds to the scenic splendour of our fair nation then they have to wake up .
the guide appears to tell it as it is .
as an internal tourist in scotland many of the sites are very disappointing with the services available second rate in many cases .
if visitscotland wants to improve this then maybe it and we as a nation should take heed of an outsider 's view of the country .
mark mitchell , scotland as mr mitchell suggests the extracts do indeed paint an image that are none to far from the truth .
i have travelled the world as a backpacker myself and found the lonely planet guides an invaluable resource in the planning of my itinery and can only praise them for the truthful nature of their reviews .
imagine yourself turning up to john ' 0 groats on a february afternoon as a backpacker , i 'm sure you would have the same comment to submit .
stuart , scotland i love everything about scotland and the scots !
they 're the most incredibly generous people , and their country is the most beautiful .
ann bailey , usa after the ravages of the glaciers and the english what do you expect a country to look like ?
douglas murray , scotland i 'm a glaswegian currently living in england .
comments like douglas murray 's apparently -lrb- yet again -rrb- blaming the english for the state of things north of the border do nothing for the tourist industry , which is surely up to scots themselves to sort out ?
we return to scotland two or three times a year , the natives are friendly , the food often dire , and if you 're in remote parts , do n't expect tourist information offices to be open on sunday , which is a real pain .
how many visitors to scotland actually go to council estates anyway ?
