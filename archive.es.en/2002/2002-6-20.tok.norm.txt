the united nations estimates that afghanistan will need at least $ 15 billion over the next ten years to repair its badly damaged infrastructure .
in fact , rebuilding the infrastructure of the devastated country has taken on so much of an urgency that soldiers with the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- stationed in afghanistan now routinely help out with reconstruction projects .
an important role for germany germany has been playing a leading role in helping afghanistan rebuild its broken bridges and streets and telecommunications network .
several german companies involved in rebuilding projects in afghanistan also receive financial aid and support from berlin .
in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .
it ’ s important that one sees the soldiers not just patrolling but also helping build something new .
it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .
meanwhile , the arrival of the bundeswehr soldiers in their large isaf lorry laden with dented packets of books , pencils and pens has already led to much excitement in the village as the children crowd around the men clad in their olive-green fatigues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany provides additional afghan aid the taliban and months of bombing have left the people of afghanistan in dire need of humanitarian aid .

the majority of patents were submitted in the fields of information science and technology . never before have businesses and private inventors been as active in applying for european patents as they have in the past year , said ingo kober , president of the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- on thursday .
in 2001 , the number of inventions submitted to the epo in munich for patent protection increased by nine percent for an all-time record of 158,200 applications in fields ranging from information science , electronics , medical technology and genetic engineering .
even the number of actual granted patents increased significantly compared to previous years .
in 2001 , the epo recognized 34,700 patents , a 26 percent jump from the year before .
international inventors according to the statistics , european inventors were especially industrious this past year .
nearly half of all the patent applications came from the 20 member states participating in the european patent organization , kober said during a press conference on thursday .
an individual breakdown by countries , however , shows that the largest single applicant for european patents was the united states with 8,600 registrations .
germany followed up a close second with 8,100 registrations , and japan came in third with 6,600 .
japan actually had the largest increase in patent applications compared to the previous year .
the netherlands , great britain , sweden and finland also recorded significant increases in patent applications for 2001 .
increase in high-tech patents as in the previous year , the fields of high-tech and electronics registered the most patents .
approximately 54 percent of all applications submitted to the epo came from 10 especially patent-active technical fields .
inventions in information technology accounted for the most applications -lrb- 10,800 -rrb- followed by medical technology -lrb- 10,200 -rrb- and electric engineering -lrb- 7,600 -rrb- .
the most significant growth was recorded in data processing , which grew 25 percent to 6,300 applications .
patent applications in the dual field of biochemistry and genetic engineering increased by nearly 19 percent for 4,200 submissions .
here , member states in the european patent organization were especially active , having topped the united states in the number of genetic engineering patents for the first time since 1997 .
more work for patent office each invention submitted to the epo for an official patent must be reviewed by a panel of employees in order to ensure the authenticity of the invention and the inventor ’ s claims for patent protection .
in order to handle the significant increase in patent applications for the year 2001 , the epo had to hire considerably more employees to check the validity of all submissions .
according to kober , 5,100 people were employed by the epo in 2001 , 3,00 of whom were patent reviewers .
in the previous year , 4,700 people worked for the patent office .
the european patent office is not an institutional component of the european union .
it is financially and administratively independent of brussels and the eu commission .
the epo ’ s yearly budget is derived from required patent fees paid by each applicant .
a european patent costs roughly 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,725 -rrb- , including the price of yearly fees and the one-time sum for receiving the patent .
because the epo registered a record budget surplus of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- this past year , kober announced on thursday that his office would consider lowering the patent fee for next year .

the united nations estimates that afghanistan will need at least $ 15 billion over the next ten years to repair its badly damaged infrastructure .
in fact , rebuilding the infrastructure of the devastated country has taken on so much of an urgency that soldiers with the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- stationed in afghanistan now routinely help out with reconstruction projects .
an important role for germany germany has been playing a leading role in helping afghanistan rebuild its broken bridges and streets and telecommunications network .
several german companies involved in rebuilding projects in afghanistan also receive financial aid and support from berlin .
in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2002 record number of patents in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european patent office logo the european patent office announced today that the number of patent registrations reached its highest point ever in 2001 .
the majority of patents were submitted in the fields of information science and technology . never before have businesses and private inventors been as active in applying for european patents as they have in the past year , said ingo kober , president of the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- on thursday .
in 2001 , the number of inventions submitted to the epo in munich for patent protection increased by nine percent for an all-time record of 158,200 applications in fields ranging from information science , electronics , medical technology and genetic engineering .
even the number of actual granted patents increased significantly compared to previous years .
in 2001 , the epo recognized 34,700 patents , a 26 percent jump from the year before .
international inventors according to the statistics , european inventors were especially industrious this past year .
nearly half of all the patent applications came from the 20 member states participating in the european patent organization , kober said during a press conference on thursday .
an individual breakdown by countries , however , shows that the largest single applicant for european patents was the united states with 8,600 registrations .
germany followed up a close second with 8,100 registrations , and japan came in third with 6,600 .
japan actually had the largest increase in patent applications compared to the previous year .
the netherlands , great britain , sweden and finland also recorded significant increases in patent applications for 2001 .
increase in high-tech patents as in the previous year , the fields of high-tech and electronics registered the most patents .
approximately 54 percent of all applications submitted to the epo came from 10 especially patent-active technical fields .
inventions in information technology accounted for the most applications -lrb- 10,800 -rrb- followed by medical technology -lrb- 10,200 -rrb- and electric engineering -lrb- 7,600 -rrb- .
the most significant growth was recorded in data processing , which grew 25 percent to 6,300 applications .
patent applications in the dual field of biochemistry and genetic engineering increased by nearly 19 percent for 4,200 submissions .
here , member states in the european patent organization were especially active , having topped the united states in the number of genetic engineering patents for the first time since 1997 .
more work for patent office each invention submitted to the epo for an official patent must be reviewed by a panel of employees in order to ensure the authenticity of the invention and the inventor ’ s claims for patent protection .
in order to handle the significant increase in patent applications for the year 2001 , the epo had to hire considerably more employees to check the validity of all submissions .
according to kober , 5,100 people were employed by the epo in 2001 , 3,00 of whom were patent reviewers .
in the previous year , 4,700 people worked for the patent office .
the european patent office is not an institutional component of the european union .
it is financially and administratively independent of brussels and the eu commission .
the epo ’ s yearly budget is derived from required patent fees paid by each applicant .
a european patent costs roughly 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,725 -rrb- , including the price of yearly fees and the one-time sum for receiving the patent .
because the epo registered a record budget surplus of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- this past year , kober announced on thursday that his office would consider lowering the patent fee for next year .
but a decrease in price might just lead to a further increase in applications and even more work for the patent office . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calling on all backyard inventors what do a fashionable egg decapitator , a mechanical pooper-scooper and an interactive soccer robot have in common ?

the majority of patents were submitted in the fields of information science and technology . never before have businesses and private inventors been as active in applying for european patents as they have in the past year , said ingo kober , president of the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- on thursday .
in 2001 , the number of inventions submitted to the epo in munich for patent protection increased by nine percent for an all-time record of 158,200 applications in fields ranging from information science , electronics , medical technology and genetic engineering .
even the number of actual granted patents increased significantly compared to previous years .
in 2001 , the epo recognized 34,700 patents , a 26 percent jump from the year before .
international inventors according to the statistics , european inventors were especially industrious this past year .
nearly half of all the patent applications came from the 20 member states participating in the european patent organization , kober said during a press conference on thursday .
an individual breakdown by countries , however , shows that the largest single applicant for european patents was the united states with 8,600 registrations .
germany followed up a close second with 8,100 registrations , and japan came in third with 6,600 .
japan actually had the largest increase in patent applications compared to the previous year .
the netherlands , great britain , sweden and finland also recorded significant increases in patent applications for 2001 .
increase in high-tech patents as in the previous year , the fields of high-tech and electronics registered the most patents .
approximately 54 percent of all applications submitted to the epo came from 10 especially patent-active technical fields .
inventions in information technology accounted for the most applications -lrb- 10,800 -rrb- followed by medical technology -lrb- 10,200 -rrb- and electric engineering -lrb- 7,600 -rrb- .
the most significant growth was recorded in data processing , which grew 25 percent to 6,300 applications .
patent applications in the dual field of biochemistry and genetic engineering increased by nearly 19 percent for 4,200 submissions .
here , member states in the european patent organization were especially active , having topped the united states in the number of genetic engineering patents for the first time since 1997 .
more work for patent office each invention submitted to the epo for an official patent must be reviewed by a panel of employees in order to ensure the authenticity of the invention and the inventor ’ s claims for patent protection .
in order to handle the significant increase in patent applications for the year 2001 , the epo had to hire considerably more employees to check the validity of all submissions .
according to kober , 5,100 people were employed by the epo in 2001 , 3,00 of whom were patent reviewers .
in the previous year , 4,700 people worked for the patent office .
the european patent office is not an institutional component of the european union .
it is financially and administratively independent of brussels and the eu commission .
the epo ’ s yearly budget is derived from required patent fees paid by each applicant .
a european patent costs roughly 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,725 -rrb- , including the price of yearly fees and the one-time sum for receiving the patent .
because the epo registered a record budget surplus of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- this past year , kober announced on thursday that his office would consider lowering the patent fee for next year .
but a decrease in price might just lead to a further increase in applications and even more work for the patent office . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calling on all backyard inventors what do a fashionable egg decapitator , a mechanical pooper-scooper and an interactive soccer robot have in common ?

the majority of patents were submitted in the fields of information science and technology . never before have businesses and private inventors been as active in applying for european patents as they have in the past year , said ingo kober , president of the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- on thursday .
in 2001 , the number of inventions submitted to the epo in munich for patent protection increased by nine percent for an all-time record of 158,200 applications in fields ranging from information science , electronics , medical technology and genetic engineering .
even the number of actual granted patents increased significantly compared to previous years .
in 2001 , the epo recognized 34,700 patents , a 26 percent jump from the year before .
international inventors according to the statistics , european inventors were especially industrious this past year .
nearly half of all the patent applications came from the 20 member states participating in the european patent organization , kober said during a press conference on thursday .
an individual breakdown by countries , however , shows that the largest single applicant for european patents was the united states with 8,600 registrations .
germany followed up a close second with 8,100 registrations , and japan came in third with 6,600 .
japan actually had the largest increase in patent applications compared to the previous year .
the netherlands , great britain , sweden and finland also recorded significant increases in patent applications for 2001 .
increase in high-tech patents as in the previous year , the fields of high-tech and electronics registered the most patents .
approximately 54 percent of all applications submitted to the epo came from 10 especially patent-active technical fields .
inventions in information technology accounted for the most applications -lrb- 10,800 -rrb- followed by medical technology -lrb- 10,200 -rrb- and electric engineering -lrb- 7,600 -rrb- .
the most significant growth was recorded in data processing , which grew 25 percent to 6,300 applications .
patent applications in the dual field of biochemistry and genetic engineering increased by nearly 19 percent for 4,200 submissions .
here , member states in the european patent organization were especially active , having topped the united states in the number of genetic engineering patents for the first time since 1997 .
more work for patent office each invention submitted to the epo for an official patent must be reviewed by a panel of employees in order to ensure the authenticity of the invention and the inventor ’ s claims for patent protection .
in order to handle the significant increase in patent applications for the year 2001 , the epo had to hire considerably more employees to check the validity of all submissions .
according to kober , 5,100 people were employed by the epo in 2001 , 3,00 of whom were patent reviewers .
in the previous year , 4,700 people worked for the patent office .
the european patent office is not an institutional component of the european union .
it is financially and administratively independent of brussels and the eu commission .
the epo ’ s yearly budget is derived from required patent fees paid by each applicant .
a european patent costs roughly 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,725 -rrb- , including the price of yearly fees and the one-time sum for receiving the patent .
because the epo registered a record budget surplus of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- this past year , kober announced on thursday that his office would consider lowering the patent fee for next year .

the majority of patents were submitted in the fields of information science and technology . never before have businesses and private inventors been as active in applying for european patents as they have in the past year , said ingo kober , president of the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- on thursday .
in 2001 , the number of inventions submitted to the epo in munich for patent protection increased by nine percent for an all-time record of 158,200 applications in fields ranging from information science , electronics , medical technology and genetic engineering .
even the number of actual granted patents increased significantly compared to previous years .
in 2001 , the epo recognized 34,700 patents , a 26 percent jump from the year before .
international inventors according to the statistics , european inventors were especially industrious this past year .
nearly half of all the patent applications came from the 20 member states participating in the european patent organization , kober said during a press conference on thursday .
an individual breakdown by countries , however , shows that the largest single applicant for european patents was the united states with 8,600 registrations .
germany followed up a close second with 8,100 registrations , and japan came in third with 6,600 .
japan actually had the largest increase in patent applications compared to the previous year .
the netherlands , great britain , sweden and finland also recorded significant increases in patent applications for 2001 .
increase in high-tech patents as in the previous year , the fields of high-tech and electronics registered the most patents .
approximately 54 percent of all applications submitted to the epo came from 10 especially patent-active technical fields .
inventions in information technology accounted for the most applications -lrb- 10,800 -rrb- followed by medical technology -lrb- 10,200 -rrb- and electric engineering -lrb- 7,600 -rrb- .
the most significant growth was recorded in data processing , which grew 25 percent to 6,300 applications .
patent applications in the dual field of biochemistry and genetic engineering increased by nearly 19 percent for 4,200 submissions .
here , member states in the european patent organization were especially active , having topped the united states in the number of genetic engineering patents for the first time since 1997 .
more work for patent office each invention submitted to the epo for an official patent must be reviewed by a panel of employees in order to ensure the authenticity of the invention and the inventor ’ s claims for patent protection .
in order to handle the significant increase in patent applications for the year 2001 , the epo had to hire considerably more employees to check the validity of all submissions .
according to kober , 5,100 people were employed by the epo in 2001 , 3,00 of whom were patent reviewers .
in the previous year , 4,700 people worked for the patent office .
the european patent office is not an institutional component of the european union .
it is financially and administratively independent of brussels and the eu commission .
the epo ’ s yearly budget is derived from required patent fees paid by each applicant .
a european patent costs roughly 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,725 -rrb- , including the price of yearly fees and the one-time sum for receiving the patent .
because the epo registered a record budget surplus of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- this past year , kober announced on thursday that his office would consider lowering the patent fee for next year .

the united nations estimates that afghanistan will need at least $ 15 billion over the next ten years to repair its badly damaged infrastructure .
in fact , rebuilding the infrastructure of the devastated country has taken on so much of an urgency that soldiers with the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- stationed in afghanistan now routinely help out with reconstruction projects .
an important role for germany germany has been playing a leading role in helping afghanistan rebuild its broken bridges and streets and telecommunications network .
several german companies involved in rebuilding projects in afghanistan also receive financial aid and support from berlin .
in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .
it ’ s important that one sees the soldiers not just patrolling but also helping build something new .
it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .
meanwhile , the arrival of the bundeswehr soldiers in their large isaf lorry laden with dented packets of books , pencils and pens has already led to much excitement in the village as the children crowd around the men clad in their olive-green fatigues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany provides additional afghan aid the taliban and months of bombing have left the people of afghanistan in dire need of humanitarian aid .

in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .
it ’ s important that one sees the soldiers not just patrolling but also helping build something new .
it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .
meanwhile , the arrival of the bundeswehr soldiers in their large isaf lorry laden with dented packets of books , pencils and pens has already led to much excitement in the village as the children crowd around the men clad in their olive-green fatigues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany provides additional afghan aid the taliban and months of bombing have left the people of afghanistan in dire need of humanitarian aid .

the majority of patents were submitted in the fields of information science and technology . never before have businesses and private inventors been as active in applying for european patents as they have in the past year , said ingo kober , president of the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- on thursday .
in 2001 , the number of inventions submitted to the epo in munich for patent protection increased by nine percent for an all-time record of 158,200 applications in fields ranging from information science , electronics , medical technology and genetic engineering .
even the number of actual granted patents increased significantly compared to previous years .
in 2001 , the epo recognized 34,700 patents , a 26 percent jump from the year before .
international inventors according to the statistics , european inventors were especially industrious this past year .
nearly half of all the patent applications came from the 20 member states participating in the european patent organization , kober said during a press conference on thursday .
an individual breakdown by countries , however , shows that the largest single applicant for european patents was the united states with 8,600 registrations .
germany followed up a close second with 8,100 registrations , and japan came in third with 6,600 .
japan actually had the largest increase in patent applications compared to the previous year .
the netherlands , great britain , sweden and finland also recorded significant increases in patent applications for 2001 .
increase in high-tech patents as in the previous year , the fields of high-tech and electronics registered the most patents .
approximately 54 percent of all applications submitted to the epo came from 10 especially patent-active technical fields .
inventions in information technology accounted for the most applications -lrb- 10,800 -rrb- followed by medical technology -lrb- 10,200 -rrb- and electric engineering -lrb- 7,600 -rrb- .
the most significant growth was recorded in data processing , which grew 25 percent to 6,300 applications .
patent applications in the dual field of biochemistry and genetic engineering increased by nearly 19 percent for 4,200 submissions .
here , member states in the european patent organization were especially active , having topped the united states in the number of genetic engineering patents for the first time since 1997 .
more work for patent office each invention submitted to the epo for an official patent must be reviewed by a panel of employees in order to ensure the authenticity of the invention and the inventor ’ s claims for patent protection .
in order to handle the significant increase in patent applications for the year 2001 , the epo had to hire considerably more employees to check the validity of all submissions .
according to kober , 5,100 people were employed by the epo in 2001 , 3,00 of whom were patent reviewers .
in the previous year , 4,700 people worked for the patent office .
the european patent office is not an institutional component of the european union .
it is financially and administratively independent of brussels and the eu commission .
the epo ’ s yearly budget is derived from required patent fees paid by each applicant .
a european patent costs roughly 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,725 -rrb- , including the price of yearly fees and the one-time sum for receiving the patent .
because the epo registered a record budget surplus of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- this past year , kober announced on thursday that his office would consider lowering the patent fee for next year .

the united nations estimates that afghanistan will need at least $ 15 billion over the next ten years to repair its badly damaged infrastructure .
in fact , rebuilding the infrastructure of the devastated country has taken on so much of an urgency that soldiers with the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- stationed in afghanistan now routinely help out with reconstruction projects .
an important role for germany germany has been playing a leading role in helping afghanistan rebuild its broken bridges and streets and telecommunications network .
several german companies involved in rebuilding projects in afghanistan also receive financial aid and support from berlin .
in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .
it ’ s important that one sees the soldiers not just patrolling but also helping build something new .
it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .

the united nations estimates that afghanistan will need at least $ 15 billion over the next ten years to repair its badly damaged infrastructure .
in fact , rebuilding the infrastructure of the devastated country has taken on so much of an urgency that soldiers with the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- stationed in afghanistan now routinely help out with reconstruction projects .
an important role for germany germany has been playing a leading role in helping afghanistan rebuild its broken bridges and streets and telecommunications network .
several german companies involved in rebuilding projects in afghanistan also receive financial aid and support from berlin .
in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .
it ’ s important that one sees the soldiers not just patrolling but also helping build something new .
it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2002 record number of patents in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european patent office logo the european patent office announced today that the number of patent registrations reached its highest point ever in 2001 .
the majority of patents were submitted in the fields of information science and technology . never before have businesses and private inventors been as active in applying for european patents as they have in the past year , said ingo kober , president of the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- on thursday .
in 2001 , the number of inventions submitted to the epo in munich for patent protection increased by nine percent for an all-time record of 158,200 applications in fields ranging from information science , electronics , medical technology and genetic engineering .
even the number of actual granted patents increased significantly compared to previous years .
in 2001 , the epo recognized 34,700 patents , a 26 percent jump from the year before .
international inventors according to the statistics , european inventors were especially industrious this past year .
nearly half of all the patent applications came from the 20 member states participating in the european patent organization , kober said during a press conference on thursday .
an individual breakdown by countries , however , shows that the largest single applicant for european patents was the united states with 8,600 registrations .
germany followed up a close second with 8,100 registrations , and japan came in third with 6,600 .
japan actually had the largest increase in patent applications compared to the previous year .
the netherlands , great britain , sweden and finland also recorded significant increases in patent applications for 2001 .
increase in high-tech patents as in the previous year , the fields of high-tech and electronics registered the most patents .
approximately 54 percent of all applications submitted to the epo came from 10 especially patent-active technical fields .
inventions in information technology accounted for the most applications -lrb- 10,800 -rrb- followed by medical technology -lrb- 10,200 -rrb- and electric engineering -lrb- 7,600 -rrb- .
the most significant growth was recorded in data processing , which grew 25 percent to 6,300 applications .
patent applications in the dual field of biochemistry and genetic engineering increased by nearly 19 percent for 4,200 submissions .
here , member states in the european patent organization were especially active , having topped the united states in the number of genetic engineering patents for the first time since 1997 .
more work for patent office each invention submitted to the epo for an official patent must be reviewed by a panel of employees in order to ensure the authenticity of the invention and the inventor ’ s claims for patent protection .
in order to handle the significant increase in patent applications for the year 2001 , the epo had to hire considerably more employees to check the validity of all submissions .
according to kober , 5,100 people were employed by the epo in 2001 , 3,00 of whom were patent reviewers .
in the previous year , 4,700 people worked for the patent office .
the european patent office is not an institutional component of the european union .
it is financially and administratively independent of brussels and the eu commission .
the epo ’ s yearly budget is derived from required patent fees paid by each applicant .
a european patent costs roughly 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,725 -rrb- , including the price of yearly fees and the one-time sum for receiving the patent .
because the epo registered a record budget surplus of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- this past year , kober announced on thursday that his office would consider lowering the patent fee for next year .
but a decrease in price might just lead to a further increase in applications and even more work for the patent office . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calling on all backyard inventors what do a fashionable egg decapitator , a mechanical pooper-scooper and an interactive soccer robot have in common ?

the united nations estimates that afghanistan will need at least $ 15 billion over the next ten years to repair its badly damaged infrastructure .
in fact , rebuilding the infrastructure of the devastated country has taken on so much of an urgency that soldiers with the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- stationed in afghanistan now routinely help out with reconstruction projects .
an important role for germany germany has been playing a leading role in helping afghanistan rebuild its broken bridges and streets and telecommunications network .
several german companies involved in rebuilding projects in afghanistan also receive financial aid and support from berlin .
in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .

it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .

but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .
it ’ s important that one sees the soldiers not just patrolling but also helping build something new .
it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .

the united nations estimates that afghanistan will need at least $ 15 billion over the next ten years to repair its badly damaged infrastructure .
in fact , rebuilding the infrastructure of the devastated country has taken on so much of an urgency that soldiers with the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- stationed in afghanistan now routinely help out with reconstruction projects .
an important role for germany germany has been playing a leading role in helping afghanistan rebuild its broken bridges and streets and telecommunications network .
several german companies involved in rebuilding projects in afghanistan also receive financial aid and support from berlin .
in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .
it ’ s important that one sees the soldiers not just patrolling but also helping build something new .
it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .

the united nations estimates that afghanistan will need at least $ 15 billion over the next ten years to repair its badly damaged infrastructure .
in fact , rebuilding the infrastructure of the devastated country has taken on so much of an urgency that soldiers with the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- stationed in afghanistan now routinely help out with reconstruction projects .
an important role for germany germany has been playing a leading role in helping afghanistan rebuild its broken bridges and streets and telecommunications network .
several german companies involved in rebuilding projects in afghanistan also receive financial aid and support from berlin .
in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .
it ’ s important that one sees the soldiers not just patrolling but also helping build something new .
it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2002 record number of patents in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european patent office logo the european patent office announced today that the number of patent registrations reached its highest point ever in 2001 .
the majority of patents were submitted in the fields of information science and technology . never before have businesses and private inventors been as active in applying for european patents as they have in the past year , said ingo kober , president of the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- on thursday .
in 2001 , the number of inventions submitted to the epo in munich for patent protection increased by nine percent for an all-time record of 158,200 applications in fields ranging from information science , electronics , medical technology and genetic engineering .
even the number of actual granted patents increased significantly compared to previous years .
in 2001 , the epo recognized 34,700 patents , a 26 percent jump from the year before .
international inventors according to the statistics , european inventors were especially industrious this past year .
nearly half of all the patent applications came from the 20 member states participating in the european patent organization , kober said during a press conference on thursday .
an individual breakdown by countries , however , shows that the largest single applicant for european patents was the united states with 8,600 registrations .
germany followed up a close second with 8,100 registrations , and japan came in third with 6,600 .
japan actually had the largest increase in patent applications compared to the previous year .
the netherlands , great britain , sweden and finland also recorded significant increases in patent applications for 2001 .
increase in high-tech patents as in the previous year , the fields of high-tech and electronics registered the most patents .
approximately 54 percent of all applications submitted to the epo came from 10 especially patent-active technical fields .
inventions in information technology accounted for the most applications -lrb- 10,800 -rrb- followed by medical technology -lrb- 10,200 -rrb- and electric engineering -lrb- 7,600 -rrb- .
the most significant growth was recorded in data processing , which grew 25 percent to 6,300 applications .
patent applications in the dual field of biochemistry and genetic engineering increased by nearly 19 percent for 4,200 submissions .
here , member states in the european patent organization were especially active , having topped the united states in the number of genetic engineering patents for the first time since 1997 .
more work for patent office each invention submitted to the epo for an official patent must be reviewed by a panel of employees in order to ensure the authenticity of the invention and the inventor ’ s claims for patent protection .
in order to handle the significant increase in patent applications for the year 2001 , the epo had to hire considerably more employees to check the validity of all submissions .
according to kober , 5,100 people were employed by the epo in 2001 , 3,00 of whom were patent reviewers .
in the previous year , 4,700 people worked for the patent office .
the european patent office is not an institutional component of the european union .
it is financially and administratively independent of brussels and the eu commission .
the epo ’ s yearly budget is derived from required patent fees paid by each applicant .
a european patent costs roughly 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,725 -rrb- , including the price of yearly fees and the one-time sum for receiving the patent .
because the epo registered a record budget surplus of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- this past year , kober announced on thursday that his office would consider lowering the patent fee for next year .
but a decrease in price might just lead to a further increase in applications and even more work for the patent office . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calling on all backyard inventors what do a fashionable egg decapitator , a mechanical pooper-scooper and an interactive soccer robot have in common ?

the united nations estimates that afghanistan will need at least $ 15 billion over the next ten years to repair its badly damaged infrastructure .
in fact , rebuilding the infrastructure of the devastated country has taken on so much of an urgency that soldiers with the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- stationed in afghanistan now routinely help out with reconstruction projects .
an important role for germany germany has been playing a leading role in helping afghanistan rebuild its broken bridges and streets and telecommunications network .
several german companies involved in rebuilding projects in afghanistan also receive financial aid and support from berlin .
in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .
it ’ s important that one sees the soldiers not just patrolling but also helping build something new .
it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .
meanwhile , the arrival of the bundeswehr soldiers in their large isaf lorry laden with dented packets of books , pencils and pens has already led to much excitement in the village as the children crowd around the men clad in their olive-green fatigues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany provides additional afghan aid the taliban and months of bombing have left the people of afghanistan in dire need of humanitarian aid .

the united nations estimates that afghanistan will need at least $ 15 billion over the next ten years to repair its badly damaged infrastructure .
in fact , rebuilding the infrastructure of the devastated country has taken on so much of an urgency that soldiers with the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- stationed in afghanistan now routinely help out with reconstruction projects .
an important role for germany germany has been playing a leading role in helping afghanistan rebuild its broken bridges and streets and telecommunications network .
several german companies involved in rebuilding projects in afghanistan also receive financial aid and support from berlin .
in particular , bundeswehr soldiers of the german contingent are involved in cimic -lrb- civilian and military co-operation -rrb- projects that are now a regular feature of peacekeeping operations worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in a street in kabul one cimic project in afghanistan involves rebuilding a bullet-riddled school in the village of de ’ sahbs , nestled in a valley among ragged mountains , about 30 kilometres from kabul .
the school - whose pupils include some 350 girls and 400 boys - falls in the french sector .
but since the french soldiers at present have no financial means to restore the school , the mission has been taken over by the germans , who have secured money from the german foreign ministry in berlin for the project .
bernd wilhelm , a worker with the bundeswehr 's cimic project in afghanistan , says that if the school didn ’ t have girl students , the bundeswehr wouldn ’ t have bothered to approach the foreign ministry for aid . wilhelms comments underscore the importance attached to the education of girls in post-taliban - especially by western donors .
soldiers to renovate damaged edifice at the moment , children at the school in de ’ sahbs attend lessons in the open – the boys in the morning , girls in the afternoon .
but the german soldiers soon hope to change that .
they have plans to refurbish the crumbling building , build a new roof , replace windows and touch up and paint the outer walls .
" if we have some money left after that , then we can buy some classroom furniture , " wilhelm says .
" but if we don ’ t have the money , then we ’ ll just get some carpets .
after all the majority of the children sit on carpets , classroom furniture is something of a luxury here " .
he estimates that the school should be up and running with the help of $ 20,000 in aid .
soldiers hope to engage villagers rural life in the village of de ’ sahbs is marked by traditions and simplicity .
the people live in houses made of clay and grow vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and grapes .
but the idyllic village still bears the scars of war and violence .
some of the fields the village lie disused and fallow because dangerous landmines are still believed to be lurking in the ground .
that ’ s one reason wilhelm is hopeful that a lot of people in the village - with the fallout of traditional occupations - would support and help in the rebuilding of the school .
the cimic project 's managers are also trying to use as many local firms as possible on the project in order to provide local inhabitants with temporary jobs .
but wilhelm says it is important to acknowledge local customs with these projects .
" we will build the school in the local style that people here are used to , " he says .
seeking to improve understanding helping out with the school rebuilding project is also a welcome change to the soldiers from their daily duties . managers also hope the project will bring the foreign soldiers a step closer to being trusted and understood by the local populace .
" helping out is sometimes more pleasant and simple than patrolling , " wilhelm says , " and i think that we ’ re also doing something for the reputation of the soldiers .
it ’ s important that one sees the soldiers not just patrolling but also helping build something new .
it will go a long way in helping the people here accept the foreign soldiers " .
meanwhile , the arrival of the bundeswehr soldiers in their large isaf lorry laden with dented packets of books , pencils and pens has already led to much excitement in the village as the children crowd around the men clad in their olive-green fatigues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany provides additional afghan aid the taliban and months of bombing have left the people of afghanistan in dire need of humanitarian aid .
hardest hit are the women and children .

the majority of patents were submitted in the fields of information science and technology . never before have businesses and private inventors been as active in applying for european patents as they have in the past year , said ingo kober , president of the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- on thursday .
in 2001 , the number of inventions submitted to the epo in munich for patent protection increased by nine percent for an all-time record of 158,200 applications in fields ranging from information science , electronics , medical technology and genetic engineering .
even the number of actual granted patents increased significantly compared to previous years .
in 2001 , the epo recognized 34,700 patents , a 26 percent jump from the year before .
international inventors according to the statistics , european inventors were especially industrious this past year .
nearly half of all the patent applications came from the 20 member states participating in the european patent organization , kober said during a press conference on thursday .
an individual breakdown by countries , however , shows that the largest single applicant for european patents was the united states with 8,600 registrations .
germany followed up a close second with 8,100 registrations , and japan came in third with 6,600 .
japan actually had the largest increase in patent applications compared to the previous year .
the netherlands , great britain , sweden and finland also recorded significant increases in patent applications for 2001 .
increase in high-tech patents as in the previous year , the fields of high-tech and electronics registered the most patents .
approximately 54 percent of all applications submitted to the epo came from 10 especially patent-active technical fields .
inventions in information technology accounted for the most applications -lrb- 10,800 -rrb- followed by medical technology -lrb- 10,200 -rrb- and electric engineering -lrb- 7,600 -rrb- .
the most significant growth was recorded in data processing , which grew 25 percent to 6,300 applications .
patent applications in the dual field of biochemistry and genetic engineering increased by nearly 19 percent for 4,200 submissions .
here , member states in the european patent organization were especially active , having topped the united states in the number of genetic engineering patents for the first time since 1997 .
more work for patent office each invention submitted to the epo for an official patent must be reviewed by a panel of employees in order to ensure the authenticity of the invention and the inventor ’ s claims for patent protection .
in order to handle the significant increase in patent applications for the year 2001 , the epo had to hire considerably more employees to check the validity of all submissions .
according to kober , 5,100 people were employed by the epo in 2001 , 3,00 of whom were patent reviewers .
in the previous year , 4,700 people worked for the patent office .
the european patent office is not an institutional component of the european union .
it is financially and administratively independent of brussels and the eu commission .
the epo ’ s yearly budget is derived from required patent fees paid by each applicant .
a european patent costs roughly 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,725 -rrb- , including the price of yearly fees and the one-time sum for receiving the patent .
because the epo registered a record budget surplus of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- this past year , kober announced on thursday that his office would consider lowering the patent fee for next year .

however , the idea does not meet with universal approval - even from anti-smoking campaigners .
the vaccine , reports new scientist magazine , would work by blocking the pleasurable effect of nicotine on the brain .
it is this chemical which leads to tobacco addiction . "
if you can take away the pleasure from the outset , children are more likely to kick the experiment early " john roberts xenova two pharmaceutical companies , florida-based nabi , and the uk 's xenova , are racing to produce a vaccine .
and both say it is possible that children could be vaccinated one day to prevent them picking up the habit in the first place .
john roberts , xenova 's medical director , told new scientist : " i think prevention offers a huge opportunity .
" if you can take away the pleasure from the outset , children are more likely to kick the experiment early .
" it normally takes several cigarettes to build up addiction . "
safety trials are underway on both vaccines , involving both smokers and non-smokers .
mr roberts said he was " very pleased " with results so far .
immune response the vaccines work by stimulating an immune response to nicotine molecules .
normally nicotine is too small to produce such a response , but researchers have attached it to a large protein so that the immune system can recognise it .
this means that antibodies are launched to attack even normal nicotine molecules in the blood , hopefully wiping them out before they reach the brain .
an estimated 80 % of smokers start in their teens , and the market potential of an effective vaccine is huge .
however , it is not clear whether regular boosters would be needed , or whether a few vaccinated patients would suffer more severe side-effects .
opposition however , even anti-smoking campaigners are luke-warm about the prospect of vaccination for non-smokers .
clive bates , from action on smoking and health , said that civil liberties groups would be angered by the threat of " mass medication " .
he said : " things such as vaccines all carry risks .
we need to walk before we can run , and help those people who are addicted to tobacco and trying to give up .
" obviously , pharmaceutical companies are trying to find the biggest possible market for their product . "

a study of babies fathered by a small number of men with klinefelter 's syndrome found that none carried the abnormality .
a normal human cell has 23 chromosome pairs , but men with klinefelter 's have an extra " x " chromosome pair .
this can lead to a variety of problems , including a round body shape , larger breasts and lack of body hair .
it also causes a lack of sperm , meaning that many men who have the syndrome have little chance of fathering a child by any method .
extracted however , in a few men , traces of sperm can be found , sometimes by taking a sample of testicle tissue , and this can be used to fertilise a partner 's eggs .
but there have been lingering fears that children produced this way have a strong chance of having the wrong number of chromosomes themselves .
a study presented at a conference in montreal last month , reported in new scientist magazine , will prove reassuring for would-be fathers .
no repeat in a group of 15 klinefelter 's patients trying to produce children using fertility treatment , nine were successful .
and there were no chromosomal abnormalities in any of the 14 babies involved .
the technique involved , icsi , in which a single sperm is injected directly into the egg , is thought to pass on chromosomal abnormalities from subfertile fathers .
that is why it is expected that icsi children will be more likely to suffer fertility problems than a standard ivf baby .
one of the boys in the canadian study did have a severe congenital heart defect , but the cause of this was unclear .
dr iwan lewis-jones , a consultant andrologist at liverpool women 's hospital , said that many klinefelter 's patients had no trace of sperm whatsoever , so would never father a child .
he said : " theoretically , in those who can father a child , you could get another klinefelter 's child .
" this is reassuring for them . "

a study of babies fathered by a small number of men with klinefelter 's syndrome found that none carried the abnormality .
a normal human cell has 23 chromosome pairs , but men with klinefelter 's have an extra " x " chromosome pair .
this can lead to a variety of problems , including a round body shape , larger breasts and lack of body hair .
it also causes a lack of sperm , meaning that many men who have the syndrome have little chance of fathering a child by any method .
extracted however , in a few men , traces of sperm can be found , sometimes by taking a sample of testicle tissue , and this can be used to fertilise a partner 's eggs .
but there have been lingering fears that children produced this way have a strong chance of having the wrong number of chromosomes themselves .
a study presented at a conference in montreal last month , reported in new scientist magazine , will prove reassuring for would-be fathers .
no repeat in a group of 15 klinefelter 's patients trying to produce children using fertility treatment , nine were successful .
and there were no chromosomal abnormalities in any of the 14 babies involved .
the technique involved , icsi , in which a single sperm is injected directly into the egg , is thought to pass on chromosomal abnormalities from subfertile fathers .
that is why it is expected that icsi children will be more likely to suffer fertility problems than a standard ivf baby .
one of the boys in the canadian study did have a severe congenital heart defect , but the cause of this was unclear .
dr iwan lewis-jones , a consultant andrologist at liverpool women 's hospital , said that many klinefelter 's patients had no trace of sperm whatsoever , so would never father a child .
he said : " theoretically , in those who can father a child , you could get another klinefelter 's child .
" this is reassuring for them . "

bbc news online explains the background to the problem .
how big is the fridges problem ?
there are thousands of old chill cabinets lying discarded in the country which local councils have been unable to bury in landfill sites or export .
councils say they are running out of storage space for the fridges .
the government has already spent £ 6m on tackling the problem and says it may cost £ 40m - with others estimating up to £ 64m .
some experts think the stock piles will not be removed until the end of next year .
how have these fridge mountains sprouted up ?
european union laws , which came into force in january , make it illegal to dispose of fridges unless substances like cfcs which eat through the ozone layer are removed first .
these rules were passed in 1998 but the uk fell behind in preparing the sites needed to recycle the fridges or burn them at the high temperatures .
no recycling kit was available in the uk when the rules came into force and incineration could only be done at two sites only capable of disposing of 8,000 fridges each week between them .
the fridges can , however , be sent to plants abroad .
as well as the storage problems , has fly-tipping of fridges also gone up ?
yes .
major kitchen retailers used to operate " take-back schemes " where they would take old fridges off people 's hands for free when they bought a new one .
the old fridges collected in those schemes used to be exported to third world countries but that practice too is banned under the eu rules .
with many people unaware that local councils will dispose of waste appliances free-of-charge , they have increasingly just dumped old fridges where they can .
who is to blame for the fridge mountains ?
thursday 's report from mps says the government has " overwhelming responsibility " for mishandling the new regulations .
do ministers accept that ?
the government instead argues the fridge problem has come about because the eu rules just were not clear enough .
they say they did not want to commit money for preparing for rules which could have been interpreted in a different way that meant the spending had been a waste of money .
so while germany , austria , sweden , the netherlands and finland were busy setting up recycling plants , uk officials were trying to resolve the ambiguous wording .
there were mixed messages from the eu and environment minister michael meacher says the uk had to ask for clarification nine times .
once the confusion was sorted out in june last year , the uk only had six months to get ready for the rules .
how has that defence gone down with the mps ?
the environment committee complains the new eu rules were pushed through parliament at " breakneck " speed .
the eu must accept some blame for the lack of clarity , it says , but if the practical implications of new rules are not clear , the government should not agree to them in the first place .

a us team have been able to engineer miniature kidneys and small " patches " of heart tissue from cloned cells and successfully test them in cows .
they said that the fact that the sophisticated immune system of the cow did not reject the tissue provides hope therapeutic cloning could also be carried out on humans without rejection .
but the technique is unlikely to be used in humans because legislation prevents organs being removed from mature foetuses .
the research , led by scientists at advanced cell technology -lrb- act -rrb- , in worcester , massachusetts , was published in the journal nature biotechnology . "
cloning could theoretically provide a limitless supply of cells and organs for any type of regenerative therapy " robert lanza , act the aim of therapeutic cloning is to take a cell from a patient and grow nerve , muscles or cartilage to replace their own tissue .
it is hoped it will be possible to create tissue which is a perfect match for the patient .
scientists hope it could be used to treat patients who have heart , lung , liver or kidney disease - and even conditions such as diabetes , arthritis , aids , strokes or cancer .
the problem in studies so far has been that animals produced by cloning inherit some dna from the egg rather than the donor cell , and these ' foreign genes ' create a risk of rejection after transplantation .
functioning kidneys in the act study , cows were cloned and the resulting embryos grown in the cow 's womb .
when , after a few weeks , the organs had begun to form , the researchers removed some kidney and muscle cells and grew them into mini-organs .
these were then grafted back under the skins of the cows from whom they were cloned .
the scientists found the organs were not rejected , despite having some foreign dna , and also began working . "
i would be quite surprised if this would be permitted in human embryos in any state of the us - or anywhere with the facilities to carry it out " baroness o 'neill , house of lords select committee on stem cell research as a cow 's immune system is relatively complex ; the researchers say their success indicates human applications may be possible .
robert lanza , vice president of medical and scientific development at act , who led the study , said : " this study furnishes the first scientific evidence that cloned tissues can be transplanted back into animals without being destroyed by the body 's immune system .
" the use in medicine to generate immune-compatible cells using cloning would overcome one of the major scientific challenges in transplantation medicine - namely , the problem of organ and tissue rejection . "
" these results bode well for the future of human therapeutic cloning .
" cloning could theoretically provide a limitless supply of cells and organs for any type of regenerative therapy . "
he added : " before now , therapeutic cloning as a means of preventing rejection was criticised by some as being purely theoretical - just an idea . "
research restrictions the researchers used cloned bovine foetuses to generate the necessary cells , but say in humans , technology should only be used to clone human embryonic stem cells and not an actual pregnancy .
the method used in their research could not be used in the uk because legislation forbids the removal of organs from a human embryos more than 14 days old .
baroness o 'neill , a member of the house of lords select committee on stem cell research , said : " this is when the ' primitive streak ' can first be seen in the embryo - up to that point the embryo may split and become twins .
" it is when the embryo starts becoming an individual .

the export boom was driven by soaring demand across asia for japanese hi-tech products like computer chips and flat screen television sets .
japan 's trade surplus - the value of its exports minus the amount of goods it imports - now stands at 619.2bn yen -lrb- $ 5bn -rrb- - up from a 344.5bn surplus in april .
it is the fifth month of rising exports , and a sign of the continuing recovery of an economy that until very recently was mired in its deepest recession since world war ii .
however , the trade surplus is also a sign for continued weak demand for foreign goods from japanese consumers , which suggests a split economy of booming exports and little economic activity at home .
another reason for the booming trade is the continued relative weakness of the yen , which makes japanese products cheap around the world , but foreign goods prohibitively expensive .
japan 's currency has managed to recover some of its poise in recent weeks , but not enough to harm the export industry .
china first one of the fastest growing markets for japanese goods was china .
exports to this country jumped by more than a quarter .
south korea was another top market , with a 22.8 % growth rate for exports .
even us importers have rediscovered their appetite for japanese products , as that country 's continues to emerge from its post-september 11 recession .
japanese exports to the us grew 5.5 % , the first year-on-year gain over the past 14 months .

"
against terrorist acts , israel will respond by capturing territories of the palestinian authority .
these territories will be held by israel as long as terror continues " israeli government statement a total of 19 israelis , including several children , were killed in the bombing of a bus in jerusalem - the worst such incident in the city for six years .
" the president believes that israel is in the middle of recovering from a very serious attack and that israel has a right to defend itself , " white house spokesman ari fleischer said .
at the same time , the president hoped that " whatever actions israel takes will be cognizant of the fact that the path to peace must still be pursued , and israel has to remember the consequences of its actions today for what happens tomorrow . "
president bush has been expected to outline an american vision for the setting up of a palestinian state .
but on wednesday , hours after another suicide bomber struck at a bus stop in jerusalem , killing six people , white house officials said mr bush would delay his speech .
" it 's obvious the immediate aftermath is not the right time , " mr fleischer said .
" the president wants to give a speech at a time when it will have the maximum impact to bring the maximum prospects for peace to the region . "
palestinian officials have denounced the new israeli policy of reoccupation and said it is likely to provoke further violence . "
any resistance to this occupation now will be legitimate and accepted by all palestinians against the occupiers " ahmed abdel-rahman yasser arafat aide the move followed an israeli cabinet decision to seize and hold on to parts of the west bank " as long as terror continues " .
prime minister ariel sharon has made it clear israel may seize more towns .
" additional acts of terror will lead to the taking of additional areas , " a statement issued by his office early on wednesday said .
before tuesday 's suicide attack , israel had talked about short-term operations to arrest wanted militants and confiscate weapons .
an israeli security official said the new policy would essentially amount to bigger and longer incursions .
he said that to fully reoccupy palestinian towns , the army would have to call up reservists and take on responsibility for civil administration - something it is not yet prepared to do .

against terrorist acts , israel will respond by capturing territories of the palestinian authority .
these territories will be held by israel as long as terror continues israeli government statement a total of 19 israelis , including several children , were killed in the bombing of a bus in jerusalem - the worst such incident in the city for six years .
" the president believes that israel is in the middle of recovering from a very serious attack and that israel has a right to defend itself , " white house spokesman ari fleischer said .
at the same time , the president hoped that " whatever actions israel takes will be cognizant of the fact that the path to peace must still be pursued , and israel has to remember the consequences of its actions today for what happens tomorrow . "
president bush has been expected to outline an american vision for the setting up of a palestinian state .
but on wednesday , hours after another suicide bomber struck at a bus stop in jerusalem , killing six people , white house officials said mr bush would delay his speech .
" it 's obvious the immediate aftermath is not the right time , " mr fleischer said .
" the president wants to give a speech at a time when it will have the maximum impact to bring the maximum prospects for peace to the region . "
palestinian officials have denounced the new israeli policy of reoccupation and said it is likely to provoke further violence .
any resistance to this occupation now will be legitimate and accepted by all palestinians against the occupiers ahmed abdel-rahman yasser arafat aide the move followed an israeli cabinet decision to seize and hold on to parts of the west bank " as long as terror continues " .
prime minister ariel sharon has made it clear israel may seize more towns .
" additional acts of terror will lead to the taking of additional areas , " a statement issued by his office early on wednesday said .
before tuesday 's suicide attack , israel had talked about short-term operations to arrest wanted militants and confiscate weapons .
an israeli security official said the new policy would essentially amount to bigger and longer incursions .
he said that to fully reoccupy palestinian towns , the army would have to call up reservists and take on responsibility for civil administration - something it is not yet prepared to do .
' occupiers and invaders ' palestinians have reacted with fury to the israeli government statement .
israeli forces at the checkpoint outside jenin " any resistance to this occupation now will be legitimate and accepted by all palestinians against the occupiers and the invaders of palestinian sovereign areas , " said ahmed abdel-rahman , an aide to yasser arafat .

the uk prime minister was in paris for his first face-to-face talks since president chirac 's centre-right coalition swept to power in last week 's parliamentary elections . "
we spoke very frankly with the wish to find a solution acceptable to both parties " jacques chirac about sangatte the french ban on british beef imports , branded " wholly illegal " by mr blair , was discussed at the working dinner , and mr chirac gave signs the embargo was soon to be reconsidered .
the two leaders also talked about how to resolve problems over the sangatte refugee camp , which the uk government wants closed .
the british beef dispute , which stems from fears of bse , goes back further than the concerns over the troubled refugee centre .
' no reason for ban ' earlier , mr blair said that if the french government would not budge in the dispute , the european commission would take action against the " illegal ban " .
" there is no reason whatever for this ban to remain - no reason in science , no reason in common sense , no reason in law , " he told mps .
as the two leaders spoke together to reporters , mr chirac revealed that the french food agency , afsa , were now due to produce a new review of the case " at the end of the month " .
that timetable is much sooner than british officials expected and bbc news correspondent jon sopel says they are now optimistic the problem might at last be going away .
but afsa is known for being independent minded so the uk government will be cautious about being too hopeful nearly a year since the european court said that france should lift its ban .
david lidington , shadow environment , food and rural affairs secretary , said he hoped the review would lead to the ban been lifted " swiftly " .
" the fact remains that the ban is illegal in both european and french law - it should be rescinded now , " he said .
the paris talks come ahead of this weekend 's european union summit in seville , which is set to be dominated by concerns about immigration .
immigration answers ?
the sangatte camp - the launching pad for many illegal attempts by asylum seekers to enter the uk through the channel tunnel , has been a controversial issue in uk-french relations .
there were no signs the problem had been solved but mr blair said they were working in " close co-operation " on immigration questions .
mr chirac said : " we spoke very frankly with the wish to find a solution acceptable to both parties . "
home ministers from both countries were engaged in " extremely deep " efforts and " each has the will to resolve the problem in a way that conforms to human rights and our reciprocal interests " .
closer links france 's new interior minister nicolas sarozy has already indicated the new government will consider closing the camp .
mr blair wants new curbs on illegal immigration on a europe-wide basis - an issue likely to be hotly debated at seville .
that would include a stronger link between eu aid to poorer countries and willingness on the part of those countries to accept back their deported nationals .
the resounding victory for the centre-right coalition in last weekend 's french parliamentary elections freed mr chirac from the constraints of his " cohabitation " with the centre-left .
mr blair described ties between the uk and france as " much closer than they were for a certain number of decades " .
