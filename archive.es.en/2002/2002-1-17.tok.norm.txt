bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- councils rebuked over rent arrears categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 17 january , 2002 , 06:14 gmt councils rebuked over rent arrears the report showed rent arrears rose by 10 % a number of scottish councils have come under fire for failing to manage their housing stock properly .
the criticism was levelled by the accounts commission after it compiled figures which showed that local authorities lost £ 28.1m in 2000/2001 through delays in re-letting empty properties .
its report also showed that rent arrears among tenants across the country rose by 10 % to £ 42m during the same period .
the commission described the figures as " worrying " but citizens advice scotland said the problems were being compounded by flaws in the housing benefit system .
empty properties are said to be a problem during the period covered by the report a total of 57,000 council houses were vacated , of which 35,000 took more than four weeks to re-let .
rent arrears accounted for nearly 10 % of the £ 456m owed by tenants to councils during the same 12-month period .
the proportion of those more than three months in arrears rose for the fourth successive year to 6.1 % - almost one in 16 tenants .
according to the report , west dunbartonshire was the worst offender for failing to collect rent arrears .
nearly one quarter of its total rent revenue remained uncollected - a loss of about £ 2m .
councils are suffering from this delay in payment created by years of benefit dependency alistair gray , cosla accounts commission chairman alastair mcnish said much of the arrears would be collected in subsequent years but described the growing trend in tenant debt as " very worrying " .
" the more councils are owed , the harder they have to work to collect it , " he said .
" council services rely on people paying their bills on time and tenants have a duty to do so .
" despite the production of best practice guidelines and repeated calls for improvement , the latest information suggests that several councils have still not got to grips with all the issues surrounding the management of council houses . "
a spokesman for citizens advice scotland said many of the problems could be avoided by simplifying the housing benefit system .
' vulnerable groups ' he said : " we find that administrative errors and protracted delays repeatedly result in citizens ' advice bureaux -lrb- cab -rrb- clients suffering rent arrears , financial hardship and threatened and actual convictions .
" and it 's often society 's most vulnerable groups - the unemployed , the low paid , lone parents and the elderly - who find themselves thrown inadvertently into rent arrears .
" citizens advice scotland wants to see a simplified single claims process developed to reduce processing and shorten processing time . "
cosla 's housing spokesperson , councillor alistair gray , said it was in the councils ' own interests to pursue all outstanding debt .
' councils are suffering ' he said : " we do regard non-payment of rent as a very serious matter and the vast majority have improved their collection rate and very few have got worse .
" councils do attach great importance to this matter and recognise that they all need to make sure that they strive towards better collection rates . "
mr gray said the introduction of tax credits had complicated matters , taking some tenants over the benefit threshold and meaning that they had to pay rent for the first time .
he added : " councils are suffering from this delay in payment created by years of benefit dependency .

the fall in net profit was massive ; down $ 1bn from the $ 708m profits made during the last quarter of 2000 .
trouble in the telecom sector added to the global banking giant 's woes during the late autumn .
" fourth quarter results were particularly affected by our exposure to private equity investments , and to enron and argentina , " said chairman and chief executive , william harrison , describing 2001 as a " challenging " year .
bad loans provisions jp morgan chase set aside $ 510m in reserves to cover potential losses from lending going forward .
" while these actions hinder current operating results , they lay the groundwork for stronger earnings recovery when market conditions improve , " said mr harrison .

the bank 's revenue growth is likely to remain soft for some time , so the focus will be on keeping expenses from rising , she said .

" taken together , they have had a substantial impact on the past fiscal year , and could lead to further disappointments in performance that would eventually result in a downgrade . "

the fall in net profit was massive ; down $ 1bn from the $ 708m profits made during the last quarter of 2000 .
trouble in the telecom sector added to the global banking giant 's woes during the late autumn .
" fourth quarter results were particularly affected by our exposure to private equity investments , and to enron and argentina , " said chairman and chief executive , william harrison , describing 2001 as a " challenging " year .
bad loans provisions jp morgan chase set aside $ 510m in reserves to cover potential losses from lending going forward .
" while these actions hinder current operating results , they lay the groundwork for stronger earnings recovery when market conditions improve , " said mr harrison .
but such an upturn is not likely anytime soon , said chief finance officer dina dublon .
the bank 's revenue growth is likely to remain soft for some time , so the focus will be on keeping expenses from rising , she said .
" we 're not counting on a full sustained recovery , " she said .
consequently , the bank will probably not " be producing our full earnings potential " , she said .
credit watch the credit rating agency standard & poor 's said jp morgan chase 's losses during the fourth quarter of 2001 were " symptomatic of a series of negative developments that have affected the bank in the course of 2001 " .
consequently it downgraded its outlook on the bank 's credit worthiness .
" none of the issues , taken individually , would be sufficient to revise the rating , " s & p said .
" taken together , they have had a substantial impact on the past fiscal year , and could lead to further disappointments in performance that would eventually result in a downgrade . "
jp morgan chase shares fell 4.41 % to 36.20 .

putting back the repayments , which were originally due on thursday , will give president eduardo duhalde 's interim government extra breathing space as it grapples with the country 's economic crisis .
us president george bush also pledged help , but warned that argentina would face a " bleak and stagnant future " unless it remained open to international trade .
eduardo duhalde : hoping for more than $ 15bn in financial aid " free markets and open trade are the best weapons against poverty , disease and tyranny , " he told the organisation of american states in washington .
president duhalde has sharply criticised the past decade of free market reforms which failed to close the gap between rich and poor in argentina .

after five hours of deliberation , the court 's eight-judge panel said it would rule on 6 february on saad eddin ibrahim 's appeal .
it was the second time the panel had postponed a decision .
ibrahim , 63 , a sociology professor at the american university in cairo , was sentenced last may to seven years in prison .
the charges included tarnishing egypt 's image , embezzlement and accepting foreign funding for his private think-tank without government approval .
the court will also decide on 6 february on a request by ibrahim 's family for his immediate release from prison for health reasons .
ibrahim 's wife has said her husband is suffering from an undiagnosed neurological disorder that requires urgent medical attention .
at the original trial , prosecutors focused on ibrahim 's writings about election fraud allegations and relations between egypt 's muslim majority and its christian minority , as well as his think-tank 's voter education projects .
mr ibrahim was tried before a state security court , which means he has no right to a conventional appeal only to a review on technical grounds .
us concern if the review request is granted , all 27 employees of ibrahim 's ibn khaldun research centre , who were convicted along with him , will get new trials .
in seeking a new trial , ibrahim 's lawyers have questioned the constitutionality of the law requiring private groups to get government permission to receive foreign funds , maintained the court did not fully consider the merits of the embezzlement charge , and said the defence team was not allowed to review all the evidence against the suspects .
egyptian and international human rights groups have condemned the trial and conviction of ibrahim and his staff .
ibrahim holds joint us-egyptian citizenship and his case has been repeatedly raised at the highest level by american officials .
but the egyptian president , hosni mubarak , has refused to be drawn on the issue in public , saying it is a matter for the courts to decide .

mountaga tall opposition leader meanwhile , students have blocked some of the capital 's roads and the humanities faculty at bamako university , demanding to be paid nine months ' bursary arrears .
they are threatening to remove themselves from the list of volunteers to work at the stadia and other venues for footballers and officials if the government does not come up with the money .
thousands of people from africa and outside the continent have been arriving in mali over the past few days .
great party the cream of africa 's football is in readiness to demonstrate their skills , attracting sports experts and managers from all over the world .
five african football teams will take part in the world cup later this year .
president konare promises that , for three weeks from january 19th , mali will host a great big party , the likes of which africa has never seen .
ever since the confederation of african football -lrb- caf -rrb- agreed to give the cup to mali four years ago , the project has been fraught with controversy .
caf demanded four venue cities .
president konare chose five , one of them , kayes , inaccessible from the malian capital by road .
the organisers are putting the finishing touches to the other four venues , bamako , segou , mopti and sikasso .
borrowed money caf had a long list of requirements for each venue - stadia , airports , health facilities , athletes ' villages , all conforming to international standards .
many malians , particularly teachers , development agents and opposition leaders , say this is a party mali can ill-afford - a party on borrowed money .
the official mascot for mali 2002 - a blue hippo organisers say the final costs can not be reckoned until the cup ends , but they admit that they have probably spent more than $ 150 million , almost double the original budget .
when other donor countries and international financial institutions such as the world bank and the imf offered no assistance , mali borrowed $ 90 million from china .
the conditions were that all the contracts for constructing the stadia and airports be given to a chinese state company , and the loan be repaid over six years .
coincidence the financial aftermath of the nations ' cup is a major concern of mali 's opposition leader , mountaga tall .
he says that even without the event , mali can hardly pay its debts , and asks : trade unions and teachers want money for education , not football " who 's going to manage the country after the nations ' cup ?
not those who decided to host it . "
mr tall sees a hidden agenda behind mr konare 's decision to host the cup , just weeks before his second and final mandate ends and presidential elections are scheduled .
" no serious political debate can be held during the nation 's cup , ' he says .
" if mali 's team wins , this government will exploit that for political reasons .
" and if mali loses , there could be unrest and violence , and the powers that be can use that too for political reasons . "
talks opposition to the football extravaganza is not a new phenomenon .
last year , students and teachers took to the streets demanding an end to the crisis that has plagued education in the country for a decade .
there are still some outstanding problems of transport and accommodation urbain sangare organising committee they chanted : " no school , no cup of nations ! "
they were angered by the government 's decision to fund the tournament while claiming that it has no money to improve education standards in the country .
talks between the government and the police union are underway in the capital to avert the strike .
sporting infrastructure but many malians are thrilled that their country will be in the limelight and there are even some who believe their team , which qualified only because it is hosting the event , is going to win the cup .
hotel owners are rubbing their hands in glee and some are jacking up prices .
mali 's ex-football star , salif keita , says this is a chance to rebuild malian soccer .
excitement has been rising for years the president of the organising committee , sory ibrahima makanguile claims that sports is important in " the fight against poverty " .
he maintains that the discontent in mali 's schools and university will be eased with the new sporting infrastructure in the country .
but that is after the cup .
during the tournament itself , mali 's schools will serve as dormitories for the many thousands of spectators expected to travel to mali who can not afford hotel prices .
spirits are running high and malians are ready to welcome their fellow africans to their home .
be gentle but is everything in place for the big game ?
urbain sangare , head of logistics for the organising committee , says that although they have been working round-the-clock for four years , some issues have still not been resolved .
" there are still some outstanding problems of transport and accommodation " , mr sangare informed me .
and he appealed to both the participants and spectators to be gentle with malians .
" we would like the people not to be too critical with us .
they have to understand our situation .
mali is a poor country . "

bbc news online talks to simon palethorpe , head of business development and it , about his experience of setting up the site .
why did john lewis wait until october to launch the website ?
john lewis already had a small transactional site running for a year or so , selling a limited range of products .
the site 's popularity took mr palethorpe by storm there was n't much investment in it by the partnership .
they had adopted very much a " wait and see " policy .
last year they decided the time was right so they bought the uk operations of buy.com to accelerate their web strategy .
the deal completed on 7 march and it became a racetrack to get a completely , new revamped web operation up and running .
we launched on 8 october .
how has the site performed so far ?
it has gone great guns and exceeded all our expectations .
john lewis has let the other people make a lot of the mistakes - and we have avoided those in setting up our own strategy .
in the month before christmas , we were receiving more than 1,000 orders a day .
and the average order size was three products when we had budgeted for half that .
from an economics point of view , this makes all the difference because you have fixed shipping costs .
we have also been getting 800,000 page impressions per day .
how did you cope with more demand that you expected ?
it took us somewhat by storm , but it was not so out of range that it had n't exceeded our capacity .
the site completed 99 % of its orders we pulled out all the stops to meet demand .
our warehouses did exceptionally well under difficult circumstances .
we managed to meet all our deadlines - 16 december was the cut-off for orders - and we delivered what we expected to .
the site was able to complete 99 % of its orders .
how did you promote the site ?
we marketed to existing john lewis customers and account holders .
you have a high-street presence and then you become a success online - that really is the best model .
the launch was also supported with mini-catalogues that previewed the best of the selection online .
we also have online partners , such as msn , and were able to market through online channels .
research has shown that it is more effective to market online , rather than through offline channels .
why do you think the site has done so well in a short time ?
i think people have been waiting for john lewis to have a good web operation .
there is also limited geographical distribution with the stores - there are only 26 stores across the country - so there is an access issue .
and generally people are getting more used to buying online .
it usually takes two years after people come online to become active shoppers .
do you think most of the shoppers were john lewis customers ?
not all the analysis has been done , but my suspicions are that a disproportionate amount will be account holders .
the website helps the stores as well in what is known as the " halo effect " .
people do their research online and then go into the stores to buy the products .
do you think that john lewis has benefited from the pioneering efforts of other e-tailers ?
john lewis has let the other people make a lot of the mistakes - and we have avoided those in setting up our own strategy .
other people have also constructed over-complicated sites and did n't focus on getting return for the effort put in .
you ca n't build functionality with no bottom-line impact .
activities should be directed by the bottom line .
john lewis has come into the arena when the attitudes have changed with people taking a more rational approach .
there is also an increasing dominance of established retail brands .
you have a high street presence and then you become a success online - that really is the best model .
very few of the pure-play e-tailers have made it over the line to becoming trusted brands .
amazon is the only one i can think of .
how long will it be before the site is profitable ?
we have a three-year vision for the business which will get us to profit quite quickly at a small scale .
we have invested between £ 30m and £ 40m over three to four years , which is basically the same investment as in a new department store .
that should get us to a breakeven point .
you have the choice of building the business into something big and significant but you push out the breakeven date .
are you able to disclose any sales figures ?
at the moment the sales figures are being kept under wraps .
our sales are a very small proportion of the john lewis group sales .
at the moment , the site 's sales are the equivalent of a small store .
but it wo n't take many years to scale up to the size of a bigger store .
do you have any plans to fold the uk buy.com site with johnlewis.com ?
there are no current plans to pull them together , but we will review how these two work together .
buy.com had a good christmas , but it is undoubted that johnlewis.com took the lion 's share over christmas .
are you planning any new functionality for johnlewis.com ?
we plan to expand the portfolio of products sold on the web .
there are currently two main areas - home , including bed , kitchen and bathroom , and gifts , including picture frames , gadgets , watches and sports goods .
we are building the assortment in those areas and then over time we might branch out .
there will also be some range refinement .
we plan to hire more people , but there wo n't be a dramatic advance .
did you do your own christmas shopping on the site ?
yes , i definitely did !
