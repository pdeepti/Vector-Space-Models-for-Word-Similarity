" we seek a new europe that has buried its historic tensions and is prepared to meet global challenges beyond europe ’ s borders , " us president george w. bush told the assembled group per video .

but the issue is n't finding much sympathy among voters and germany 's political establishment . the junior partner in gerhard schröder ’ s governing coalition announced on friday that it would fight to adopt the liberal drug laws that have drawn thousands of marijuana and hashish users to neighboring holland .
green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .
and possession of less than 10 daily doses of marijuana has been fully decriminalized .
late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .
approximately 70 percent of the population believes that marijuana is an " introductory drug " that leads to the use of harder drugs like heroin .
struggling party but the public opposition wo n't stop the greens in their campaign to legalize the green stuff .
to the contrary , it might actually help increase the party ’ s name recognition among voters .
the party has been struggling in the polls following a four-year government reign that has seen them lose a portion of their supporters .
the six percent the party is currently polling among voters is dangerously close to the five percent mark , below which a party is barred from participating in parliament .
to attract attention to their party and gain support for the green ’ s position on the issue , the party 's youth wing plans to drive through germany from july to the end of august with a truck carrying a giant three-dimensional marijuana joint .

the alliance came under criticism after disastrous and ineffective bombing campaigns in yugoslavia in 1999 and revelations that it was unequipped to fight the wars of the 21st century .
at a recent nato meeting , us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged nato to close the technology gap and equip itself to fight the nuclear , chemical and biological threats of today .
some european politicians , including german chancellor challenger edmund stoiber , have advocated an increase in defense budget spending to close that gap .
stabilizing all the way to russia ’ s front door though the expansion won ’ t bring in massive or particularly advanced armies , proponents say it will stabilize a still volatile region .
washington is behind plans that would bring in funding to help countries modernize their armies and avoid depending on us military power to solve european conflicts .
russia , which joined nato as a non-voting member in may , remains wary of the eastward expansion , which will create a military alliance that rubs up against its borders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "

but the issue is n't finding much sympathy among voters and germany 's political establishment . the junior partner in gerhard schröder ’ s governing coalition announced on friday that it would fight to adopt the liberal drug laws that have drawn thousands of marijuana and hashish users to neighboring holland .
green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .
and possession of less than 10 daily doses of marijuana has been fully decriminalized .
late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .
approximately 70 percent of the population believes that marijuana is an " introductory drug " that leads to the use of harder drugs like heroin .
struggling party but the public opposition wo n't stop the greens in their campaign to legalize the green stuff .
to the contrary , it might actually help increase the party ’ s name recognition among voters .
the party has been struggling in the polls following a four-year government reign that has seen them lose a portion of their supporters .
the six percent the party is currently polling among voters is dangerously close to the five percent mark , below which a party is barred from participating in parliament .
to attract attention to their party and gain support for the green ’ s position on the issue , the party 's youth wing plans to drive through germany from july to the end of august with a truck carrying a giant three-dimensional marijuana joint .
the slogan : " a joint must go through germany .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the issue is n't finding much sympathy among voters and germany 's political establishment . the junior partner in gerhard schröder ’ s governing coalition announced on friday that it would fight to adopt the liberal drug laws that have drawn thousands of marijuana and hashish users to neighboring holland .
green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .
and possession of less than 10 daily doses of marijuana has been fully decriminalized .
late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .
approximately 70 percent of the population believes that marijuana is an " introductory drug " that leads to the use of harder drugs like heroin .
struggling party but the public opposition wo n't stop the greens in their campaign to legalize the green stuff .
to the contrary , it might actually help increase the party ’ s name recognition among voters .
the party has been struggling in the polls following a four-year government reign that has seen them lose a portion of their supporters .
the six percent the party is currently polling among voters is dangerously close to the five percent mark , below which a party is barred from participating in parliament .
to attract attention to their party and gain support for the green ’ s position on the issue , the party 's youth wing plans to drive through germany from july to the end of august with a truck carrying a giant three-dimensional marijuana joint .

the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .
approximately 70 percent of the population believes that marijuana is an " introductory drug " that leads to the use of harder drugs like heroin .
struggling party but the public opposition wo n't stop the greens in their campaign to legalize the green stuff .
to the contrary , it might actually help increase the party ’ s name recognition among voters .
the party has been struggling in the polls following a four-year government reign that has seen them lose a portion of their supporters .
the six percent the party is currently polling among voters is dangerously close to the five percent mark , below which a party is barred from participating in parliament .
to attract attention to their party and gain support for the green ’ s position on the issue , the party 's youth wing plans to drive through germany from july to the end of august with a truck carrying a giant three-dimensional marijuana joint .
the slogan : " a joint must go through germany .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a meeting in latvia this weekend is the test run before expansion is approved in november . the champagne is on ice in the defense ministries of 10 eastern european countries set to join the nato security alliance this fall .
at a meeting in riga , latvia this weekend , the 10 heads of state will once again stress to current nato members their desire to join the north atlantic defense alliance this november .
many see the two-day summit as a formality , as almost all of the 10 nations are set to be a lock when current nato members vote on expansion in prague november 21-22 .
" we seek a new europe that has buried its historic tensions and is prepared to meet global challenges beyond europe ’ s borders , " us president george w. bush told the assembled group per video .
the alliance ’ s expansion , the result of two years of negotiations , has grown in importance since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
proponents see the expansion as modernizing the cold war alliance into an effective terrorist-fighting organization .
" new members will help improve nato ’ s capabilities , " bush told the gathering .

green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .

late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .

alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .

too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the issue is n't finding much sympathy among voters and germany 's political establishment . the junior partner in gerhard schröder ’ s governing coalition announced on friday that it would fight to adopt the liberal drug laws that have drawn thousands of marijuana and hashish users to neighboring holland .
green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .
and possession of less than 10 daily doses of marijuana has been fully decriminalized .
late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .
approximately 70 percent of the population believes that marijuana is an " introductory drug " that leads to the use of harder drugs like heroin .
struggling party but the public opposition wo n't stop the greens in their campaign to legalize the green stuff .
to the contrary , it might actually help increase the party ’ s name recognition among voters .
the party has been struggling in the polls following a four-year government reign that has seen them lose a portion of their supporters .
the six percent the party is currently polling among voters is dangerously close to the five percent mark , below which a party is barred from participating in parliament .
to attract attention to their party and gain support for the green ’ s position on the issue , the party 's youth wing plans to drive through germany from july to the end of august with a truck carrying a giant three-dimensional marijuana joint .
the slogan : " a joint must go through germany .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .

the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .

but the issue is n't finding much sympathy among voters and germany 's political establishment . the junior partner in gerhard schröder ’ s governing coalition announced on friday that it would fight to adopt the liberal drug laws that have drawn thousands of marijuana and hashish users to neighboring holland .
green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .
and possession of less than 10 daily doses of marijuana has been fully decriminalized .
late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .
approximately 70 percent of the population believes that marijuana is an " introductory drug " that leads to the use of harder drugs like heroin .
struggling party but the public opposition wo n't stop the greens in their campaign to legalize the green stuff .
to the contrary , it might actually help increase the party ’ s name recognition among voters .
the party has been struggling in the polls following a four-year government reign that has seen them lose a portion of their supporters .
the six percent the party is currently polling among voters is dangerously close to the five percent mark , below which a party is barred from participating in parliament .
to attract attention to their party and gain support for the green ’ s position on the issue , the party 's youth wing plans to drive through germany from july to the end of august with a truck carrying a giant three-dimensional marijuana joint .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.07.2002 a new , expansive direction for nato großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-day nato summit in riga , latvia , focuses on eastern expansion ten eastern european countries are inching ever closer to becoming members of nato .
a meeting in latvia this weekend is the test run before expansion is approved in november . the champagne is on ice in the defense ministries of 10 eastern european countries set to join the nato security alliance this fall .
at a meeting in riga , latvia this weekend , the 10 heads of state will once again stress to current nato members their desire to join the north atlantic defense alliance this november .
many see the two-day summit as a formality , as almost all of the 10 nations are set to be a lock when current nato members vote on expansion in prague november 21-22 .
" we seek a new europe that has buried its historic tensions and is prepared to meet global challenges beyond europe ’ s borders , " us president george w. bush told the assembled group per video .
the alliance ’ s expansion , the result of two years of negotiations , has grown in importance since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
proponents see the expansion as modernizing the cold war alliance into an effective terrorist-fighting organization .
" new members will help improve nato ’ s capabilities , " bush told the gathering .
baltic states latvia , lithuania and estonia , as well as slovenia , croatia , slovakia , romania and bulgaria all look to have excellent chances at getting into nato .
macedonia and albania are teetering on the edge because of continued domestic instability .
searching for a new role to enter into the alliance , candidate countries have to exhibit a commitment to democracy and push through economic and military reforms required by nato .
this weekend , talk is expected to focus on freedom of the press , corruption and fighting anti-semitism , problems that still persist in many of the candidate countries .
" we ’ re not exactly popping the champagne bottles yet , but to some extent we ’ re celebrating what will be an important historical event , " latvian foreign minister indulis berzins said in the washington post .
the expansion comes at a time when nato is still searching for its new role more than a decade after the collapse of its cold war enemy , the soviet union .
the alliance came under criticism after disastrous and ineffective bombing campaigns in yugoslavia in 1999 and revelations that it was unequipped to fight the wars of the 21st century .
at a recent nato meeting , us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged nato to close the technology gap and equip itself to fight the nuclear , chemical and biological threats of today .
some european politicians , including german chancellor challenger edmund stoiber , have advocated an increase in defense budget spending to close that gap .
stabilizing all the way to russia ’ s front door though the expansion won ’ t bring in massive or particularly advanced armies , proponents say it will stabilize a still volatile region .
washington is behind plans that would bring in funding to help countries modernize their armies and avoid depending on us military power to solve european conflicts .
russia , which joined nato as a non-voting member in may , remains wary of the eastward expansion , which will create a military alliance that rubs up against its borders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .
and possession of less than 10 daily doses of marijuana has been fully decriminalized .
late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .
approximately 70 percent of the population believes that marijuana is an " introductory drug " that leads to the use of harder drugs like heroin .
struggling party but the public opposition wo n't stop the greens in their campaign to legalize the green stuff .
to the contrary , it might actually help increase the party ’ s name recognition among voters .
the party has been struggling in the polls following a four-year government reign that has seen them lose a portion of their supporters .
the six percent the party is currently polling among voters is dangerously close to the five percent mark , below which a party is barred from participating in parliament .
to attract attention to their party and gain support for the green ’ s position on the issue , the party 's youth wing plans to drive through germany from july to the end of august with a truck carrying a giant three-dimensional marijuana joint .
the slogan : " a joint must go through germany .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .

a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .

the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .

but the issue is n't finding much sympathy among voters and germany 's political establishment . the junior partner in gerhard schröder ’ s governing coalition announced on friday that it would fight to adopt the liberal drug laws that have drawn thousands of marijuana and hashish users to neighboring holland .
green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .
and possession of less than 10 daily doses of marijuana has been fully decriminalized .
late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .
approximately 70 percent of the population believes that marijuana is an " introductory drug " that leads to the use of harder drugs like heroin .
struggling party but the public opposition wo n't stop the greens in their campaign to legalize the green stuff .
to the contrary , it might actually help increase the party ’ s name recognition among voters .
the party has been struggling in the polls following a four-year government reign that has seen them lose a portion of their supporters .
the six percent the party is currently polling among voters is dangerously close to the five percent mark , below which a party is barred from participating in parliament .
to attract attention to their party and gain support for the green ’ s position on the issue , the party 's youth wing plans to drive through germany from july to the end of august with a truck carrying a giant three-dimensional marijuana joint .
the slogan : " a joint must go through germany .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .

but the issue is n't finding much sympathy among voters and germany 's political establishment . the junior partner in gerhard schröder ’ s governing coalition announced on friday that it would fight to adopt the liberal drug laws that have drawn thousands of marijuana and hashish users to neighboring holland .
green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .
and possession of less than 10 daily doses of marijuana has been fully decriminalized .
late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .
approximately 70 percent of the population believes that marijuana is an " introductory drug " that leads to the use of harder drugs like heroin .
struggling party but the public opposition wo n't stop the greens in their campaign to legalize the green stuff .
to the contrary , it might actually help increase the party ’ s name recognition among voters .
the party has been struggling in the polls following a four-year government reign that has seen them lose a portion of their supporters .
the six percent the party is currently polling among voters is dangerously close to the five percent mark , below which a party is barred from participating in parliament .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a meeting in latvia this weekend is the test run before expansion is approved in november . the champagne is on ice in the defense ministries of 10 eastern european countries set to join the nato security alliance this fall .
at a meeting in riga , latvia this weekend , the 10 heads of state will once again stress to current nato members their desire to join the north atlantic defense alliance this november .
many see the two-day summit as a formality , as almost all of the 10 nations are set to be a lock when current nato members vote on expansion in prague november 21-22 .
" we seek a new europe that has buried its historic tensions and is prepared to meet global challenges beyond europe ’ s borders , " us president george w. bush told the assembled group per video .
the alliance ’ s expansion , the result of two years of negotiations , has grown in importance since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
proponents see the expansion as modernizing the cold war alliance into an effective terrorist-fighting organization .
" new members will help improve nato ’ s capabilities , " bush told the gathering .
baltic states latvia , lithuania and estonia , as well as slovenia , croatia , slovakia , romania and bulgaria all look to have excellent chances at getting into nato .
macedonia and albania are teetering on the edge because of continued domestic instability .
searching for a new role to enter into the alliance , candidate countries have to exhibit a commitment to democracy and push through economic and military reforms required by nato .
this weekend , talk is expected to focus on freedom of the press , corruption and fighting anti-semitism , problems that still persist in many of the candidate countries .
" we ’ re not exactly popping the champagne bottles yet , but to some extent we ’ re celebrating what will be an important historical event , " latvian foreign minister indulis berzins said in the washington post .
the expansion comes at a time when nato is still searching for its new role more than a decade after the collapse of its cold war enemy , the soviet union .
the alliance came under criticism after disastrous and ineffective bombing campaigns in yugoslavia in 1999 and revelations that it was unequipped to fight the wars of the 21st century .
at a recent nato meeting , us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged nato to close the technology gap and equip itself to fight the nuclear , chemical and biological threats of today .
some european politicians , including german chancellor challenger edmund stoiber , have advocated an increase in defense budget spending to close that gap .
stabilizing all the way to russia ’ s front door though the expansion won ’ t bring in massive or particularly advanced armies , proponents say it will stabilize a still volatile region .
washington is behind plans that would bring in funding to help countries modernize their armies and avoid depending on us military power to solve european conflicts .
russia , which joined nato as a non-voting member in may , remains wary of the eastward expansion , which will create a military alliance that rubs up against its borders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a meeting in latvia this weekend is the test run before expansion is approved in november . the champagne is on ice in the defense ministries of 10 eastern european countries set to join the nato security alliance this fall .
at a meeting in riga , latvia this weekend , the 10 heads of state will once again stress to current nato members their desire to join the north atlantic defense alliance this november .
many see the two-day summit as a formality , as almost all of the 10 nations are set to be a lock when current nato members vote on expansion in prague november 21-22 .
" we seek a new europe that has buried its historic tensions and is prepared to meet global challenges beyond europe ’ s borders , " us president george w. bush told the assembled group per video .
the alliance ’ s expansion , the result of two years of negotiations , has grown in importance since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
proponents see the expansion as modernizing the cold war alliance into an effective terrorist-fighting organization .
" new members will help improve nato ’ s capabilities , " bush told the gathering .
baltic states latvia , lithuania and estonia , as well as slovenia , croatia , slovakia , romania and bulgaria all look to have excellent chances at getting into nato .
macedonia and albania are teetering on the edge because of continued domestic instability .
searching for a new role to enter into the alliance , candidate countries have to exhibit a commitment to democracy and push through economic and military reforms required by nato .
this weekend , talk is expected to focus on freedom of the press , corruption and fighting anti-semitism , problems that still persist in many of the candidate countries .
" we ’ re not exactly popping the champagne bottles yet , but to some extent we ’ re celebrating what will be an important historical event , " latvian foreign minister indulis berzins said in the washington post .
the expansion comes at a time when nato is still searching for its new role more than a decade after the collapse of its cold war enemy , the soviet union .
the alliance came under criticism after disastrous and ineffective bombing campaigns in yugoslavia in 1999 and revelations that it was unequipped to fight the wars of the 21st century .
at a recent nato meeting , us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged nato to close the technology gap and equip itself to fight the nuclear , chemical and biological threats of today .
some european politicians , including german chancellor challenger edmund stoiber , have advocated an increase in defense budget spending to close that gap .
stabilizing all the way to russia ’ s front door though the expansion won ’ t bring in massive or particularly advanced armies , proponents say it will stabilize a still volatile region .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the issue is n't finding much sympathy among voters and germany 's political establishment . the junior partner in gerhard schröder ’ s governing coalition announced on friday that it would fight to adopt the liberal drug laws that have drawn thousands of marijuana and hashish users to neighboring holland .
green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .
and possession of less than 10 daily doses of marijuana has been fully decriminalized .
late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.07.2002 a new , expansive direction for nato großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-day nato summit in riga , latvia , focuses on eastern expansion ten eastern european countries are inching ever closer to becoming members of nato .
a meeting in latvia this weekend is the test run before expansion is approved in november . the champagne is on ice in the defense ministries of 10 eastern european countries set to join the nato security alliance this fall .
at a meeting in riga , latvia this weekend , the 10 heads of state will once again stress to current nato members their desire to join the north atlantic defense alliance this november .
many see the two-day summit as a formality , as almost all of the 10 nations are set to be a lock when current nato members vote on expansion in prague november 21-22 .
" we seek a new europe that has buried its historic tensions and is prepared to meet global challenges beyond europe ’ s borders , " us president george w. bush told the assembled group per video .
the alliance ’ s expansion , the result of two years of negotiations , has grown in importance since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
proponents see the expansion as modernizing the cold war alliance into an effective terrorist-fighting organization .
" new members will help improve nato ’ s capabilities , " bush told the gathering .
baltic states latvia , lithuania and estonia , as well as slovenia , croatia , slovakia , romania and bulgaria all look to have excellent chances at getting into nato .
macedonia and albania are teetering on the edge because of continued domestic instability .
searching for a new role to enter into the alliance , candidate countries have to exhibit a commitment to democracy and push through economic and military reforms required by nato .
this weekend , talk is expected to focus on freedom of the press , corruption and fighting anti-semitism , problems that still persist in many of the candidate countries .
" we ’ re not exactly popping the champagne bottles yet , but to some extent we ’ re celebrating what will be an important historical event , " latvian foreign minister indulis berzins said in the washington post .
the expansion comes at a time when nato is still searching for its new role more than a decade after the collapse of its cold war enemy , the soviet union .
the alliance came under criticism after disastrous and ineffective bombing campaigns in yugoslavia in 1999 and revelations that it was unequipped to fight the wars of the 21st century .
at a recent nato meeting , us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged nato to close the technology gap and equip itself to fight the nuclear , chemical and biological threats of today .
some european politicians , including german chancellor challenger edmund stoiber , have advocated an increase in defense budget spending to close that gap .
stabilizing all the way to russia ’ s front door though the expansion won ’ t bring in massive or particularly advanced armies , proponents say it will stabilize a still volatile region .
washington is behind plans that would bring in funding to help countries modernize their armies and avoid depending on us military power to solve european conflicts .
russia , which joined nato as a non-voting member in may , remains wary of the eastward expansion , which will create a military alliance that rubs up against its borders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.07.2002 a new , expansive direction for nato großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-day nato summit in riga , latvia , focuses on eastern expansion ten eastern european countries are inching ever closer to becoming members of nato .
a meeting in latvia this weekend is the test run before expansion is approved in november . the champagne is on ice in the defense ministries of 10 eastern european countries set to join the nato security alliance this fall .
at a meeting in riga , latvia this weekend , the 10 heads of state will once again stress to current nato members their desire to join the north atlantic defense alliance this november .
many see the two-day summit as a formality , as almost all of the 10 nations are set to be a lock when current nato members vote on expansion in prague november 21-22 .
" we seek a new europe that has buried its historic tensions and is prepared to meet global challenges beyond europe ’ s borders , " us president george w. bush told the assembled group per video .
the alliance ’ s expansion , the result of two years of negotiations , has grown in importance since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
proponents see the expansion as modernizing the cold war alliance into an effective terrorist-fighting organization .
" new members will help improve nato ’ s capabilities , " bush told the gathering .
baltic states latvia , lithuania and estonia , as well as slovenia , croatia , slovakia , romania and bulgaria all look to have excellent chances at getting into nato .
macedonia and albania are teetering on the edge because of continued domestic instability .
searching for a new role to enter into the alliance , candidate countries have to exhibit a commitment to democracy and push through economic and military reforms required by nato .
this weekend , talk is expected to focus on freedom of the press , corruption and fighting anti-semitism , problems that still persist in many of the candidate countries .
" we ’ re not exactly popping the champagne bottles yet , but to some extent we ’ re celebrating what will be an important historical event , " latvian foreign minister indulis berzins said in the washington post .
the expansion comes at a time when nato is still searching for its new role more than a decade after the collapse of its cold war enemy , the soviet union .
the alliance came under criticism after disastrous and ineffective bombing campaigns in yugoslavia in 1999 and revelations that it was unequipped to fight the wars of the 21st century .
at a recent nato meeting , us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged nato to close the technology gap and equip itself to fight the nuclear , chemical and biological threats of today .
some european politicians , including german chancellor challenger edmund stoiber , have advocated an increase in defense budget spending to close that gap .
stabilizing all the way to russia ’ s front door though the expansion won ’ t bring in massive or particularly advanced armies , proponents say it will stabilize a still volatile region .
washington is behind plans that would bring in funding to help countries modernize their armies and avoid depending on us military power to solve european conflicts .
russia , which joined nato as a non-voting member in may , remains wary of the eastward expansion , which will create a military alliance that rubs up against its borders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a meeting in latvia this weekend is the test run before expansion is approved in november . the champagne is on ice in the defense ministries of 10 eastern european countries set to join the nato security alliance this fall .
at a meeting in riga , latvia this weekend , the 10 heads of state will once again stress to current nato members their desire to join the north atlantic defense alliance this november .
many see the two-day summit as a formality , as almost all of the 10 nations are set to be a lock when current nato members vote on expansion in prague november 21-22 .
" we seek a new europe that has buried its historic tensions and is prepared to meet global challenges beyond europe ’ s borders , " us president george w. bush told the assembled group per video .
the alliance ’ s expansion , the result of two years of negotiations , has grown in importance since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
proponents see the expansion as modernizing the cold war alliance into an effective terrorist-fighting organization .
" new members will help improve nato ’ s capabilities , " bush told the gathering .
baltic states latvia , lithuania and estonia , as well as slovenia , croatia , slovakia , romania and bulgaria all look to have excellent chances at getting into nato .
macedonia and albania are teetering on the edge because of continued domestic instability .
searching for a new role to enter into the alliance , candidate countries have to exhibit a commitment to democracy and push through economic and military reforms required by nato .
this weekend , talk is expected to focus on freedom of the press , corruption and fighting anti-semitism , problems that still persist in many of the candidate countries .
" we ’ re not exactly popping the champagne bottles yet , but to some extent we ’ re celebrating what will be an important historical event , " latvian foreign minister indulis berzins said in the washington post .
the expansion comes at a time when nato is still searching for its new role more than a decade after the collapse of its cold war enemy , the soviet union .
the alliance came under criticism after disastrous and ineffective bombing campaigns in yugoslavia in 1999 and revelations that it was unequipped to fight the wars of the 21st century .
at a recent nato meeting , us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged nato to close the technology gap and equip itself to fight the nuclear , chemical and biological threats of today .
some european politicians , including german chancellor challenger edmund stoiber , have advocated an increase in defense budget spending to close that gap .
stabilizing all the way to russia ’ s front door though the expansion won ’ t bring in massive or particularly advanced armies , proponents say it will stabilize a still volatile region .
washington is behind plans that would bring in funding to help countries modernize their armies and avoid depending on us military power to solve european conflicts .

but the issue is n't finding much sympathy among voters and germany 's political establishment . the junior partner in gerhard schröder ’ s governing coalition announced on friday that it would fight to adopt the liberal drug laws that have drawn thousands of marijuana and hashish users to neighboring holland .
green party chair claudia roth said at a berlin press conference that use of the drug should be no made more criminal than the consumption of alcohol .
" it can ’ t be possible that the possession of cannabis is looked at differently than a case of beer in the car trunk , " roth said .
" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .
and possession of less than 10 daily doses of marijuana has been fully decriminalized .
late last year the swiss states council -lrb- ständerat -rrb- voted to legalize cannabis consumption .
the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .
approximately 70 percent of the population believes that marijuana is an " introductory drug " that leads to the use of harder drugs like heroin .

the six percent the party is currently polling among voters is dangerously close to the five percent mark , below which a party is barred from participating in parliament .

" every year , there are thousands of deaths related to alcohol , but none related to cannabis consumption . "
the argument echoes similar statements made by legalization advocates across the globe .
holland has the most liberal policy of all so far , allowing the consumption and purchase of small amounts of cannabis at cafes across the country .
a more liberal europe the dutch approach has begun gaining popularity across europe .
portugal removed criminal penalties for the use of small amounts of all formally illegal drugs .

the lower house of the swiss parliament still needs to ratify the proposal , but in the meantime , many of the country 's 26 states have effectively decriminalized pot .
if adopted , the german green proposal would set up holland-style coffee shops in which adults over 18 could buy and consume up to five grams of cannabis , says green legal expert volker beck .
not in germany the green ’ s approach will most likely have a tough time winning people over in germany .
just a few months ago , the country ’ s drug czar , marion casper-merk , issued a statement concerning increased drug consumption among the country 's youth .
the number of drug-related deaths in 2001 hit its highest level in nearly a decade , with 2,030 people dying from drug-related causes .
according to studies conducted by germany ’ s health ministry , 26 percent of all 12 to 15-year olds had experimented with marijuana in the year 2000 .
during that same year , 1.2 million men and 450,000 women were registered as long-term marijuana users .
alarmed by these statistics , casper-merk said she is developing a comprehensive new strategy to fight drug abuse that will focus more on prevention .
she categorically opposed the legalization of any type of drugs .
recent studies show that germans are far less in favor of decriminalizing marijuana than their european neighbors in holland , switzerland and england .
a survey conducted by the emnid research institute for the federal drug network indicates that 62 percent of germans are opposed to changing the current drug law to allow legal use of marijuana .

germans who live in the vicinity of a recycling container have sensed it all along - germany is world champion in the science of waste recycling .
but how successful is the country really in reducing trash ? at a time when the economy is in a slump and the country 's soccer team just missed claiming the world cup title , it might be a soothing piece of news for germans to know that they still have a number one hit : their recycling system , " duales system deutschland ag " -lrb- dual system -rrb- .
since its introduction in 1991 , more than 15 countries have adopted germany 's recycling system , and every year more are looking at establishing similar structures in their own countries .
but how successful is the system at reducing waste ?
mandatory recycling it all started about 11 years ago when germany introduced a new environmental regulation that required manufacturers to take back their packaging materials for recycling .
but because not all manufacturers in germany could afford to reclaim used packaging and recycle it , a new company called the " duales system " was established for handling the entire process for all germany ’ s manufacturers .
since 1991 , all products sold in germany that contain reusable plastic or metal materials have to be marked with a so-called " grüne punkt " -lrb- green dot -rrb- .
the green marking is proof that the product ’ s manufacturers have paid a license fee to the duales system to take over the recycling of their company ’ s products .
the duales system manages the recycling of all product packaging from paper to plastic , and aluminum to glass .
the price system for the green dot license is designed in such a way that it gives manufacturers an extra incentive to reduce packaging waste .
the lighter the packaging , the less the producer pays for the recycling fee , thereby making the product cheaper for the consumer and thus more competitive on the market .
ideally , the duales system encourages companies to design better recyclable packaging which in turn leads to a reduction in overall packaging waste .
extending the life of a yogurt container in practice the duales system means that once a consumer has finished eating a yogurt , the container goes into a special recycling bin , where the plastic wrapping from toilet paper , cola cans and other reusable material is collected .
from the consumer ’ s home the empty yogurt container is then brought to a recycling facility where the different packaging materials are sorted .
special mechanized strainers separate the big packaging parts from the small .
magnets pull out tins and cans , lasers differentiate between paper and synthetic coated packaging , and concentrated bursts of wind blow plastic containers from the conveyer belt .
the plastic containers , such as from a yogurt , are collected and melted down for reuse .
the science of sorting trash over the past decade , germans have grown accustomed to the system of having more than one garbage can in their kitchen and at least three big color-coded bins in front of their house .
everyone from child to adult knows the meaning of the different bins : blue is for paper , brown for organic waste , and yellow for all packaging products with a green dot .
extra large bins at community points are also set up for collecting different types of glass .
while some germans almost make a science out of sorting their trash , others are quite careless , says garbage man volker from krefeld .
this is especially true in some " disadvantaged neighborhoods , " he says , " where you realize that people do n't care quite as much about recycling .
they throw in all sorts of stuff that does n't belong in there .
one day , i even found the motor of a motorcycle in the yellow recycling bin . "
controversial issue regardless of how many people have gotten used to the system of the green dot , and no matter how many other countries have copied the german recycling system , the " duales system " continues to spark a debate in germany .
one charge often raised against the system is that after all the sorting , at the end of the day , most of the collected material is just burned anyway .
but achim struchholz , spokesman of the " duales system deutschland ag " insists that all the valuable materials are being recycled .
" it would n't make sense to burn it , neither from an economical nor from an environmental point of view , " he says .
" what does happen , though , is that people just throw organic waste into the bins that are intended for recycling .
and those things we can not recycle , so , yes , we have to burn them or bring them to the dump site . "
doese the system reduce waste ?
the duales system deutschland ag maintains that since introducing the green dot in 1991 it has managed to reduce waste from wrapping materials by 14 percent , from 95 kilograms -lrb- 209 pounds -rrb- per capita in 1991 to 82 kilograms -lrb- 180 pounds -rrb- in 1999 .
this is considerably better than germany ’ s neighbors in the netherlands , who during the same time period increased their packaging waste by 20 percent .
throughout europe , germany has one of the lowest levels of packaging waste , a surprising fact considering germany is a highly industrialized country .
but while independent studies support the success of the duales system , environmentalists have other objections .
for eva leonhardt from the german environmental organization bund , the duales system only addresses part of the waste problem .
" in the beginning , the license fees provided an incentive for producers to look for lighter packaging alternatives , because they wanted their products to be cheaper and thus more competitive in the market , " leonhard says .
the result was actually a reduction in packaging waste .
" but we have now come to the point where the total amount of waste in germany is growing again .
and that 's because everyone is just sorting their trash and no one is really trying to reduce waste anymore . "
too many consumers simply leave the task of waste reduction to the companies to deal with , she says .
higher trash piles quite ironically , the duales system actually fosters a line of thinking it caricatured in a tv-spot at the outset of its work in the early 1990s .
it showed a family carelessly throwing away its garbage so that it piled up waist-high around the house .
a voice in the background warned , " we are drowning in waste .
build higher houses ! "
the question now is how the duales system will manage to continue reducing the height of germany ’ s growing trash piles so that it doesn ’ t have to build higher houses or bigger landfills .
only a reduction in the amount or products consumed and waste produced is an indicator of whether or not germany truly is number one in recycling . kerstin steinbrecher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the dual system more information on germany 's " dual system " radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a meeting in latvia this weekend is the test run before expansion is approved in november . the champagne is on ice in the defense ministries of 10 eastern european countries set to join the nato security alliance this fall .
at a meeting in riga , latvia this weekend , the 10 heads of state will once again stress to current nato members their desire to join the north atlantic defense alliance this november .
many see the two-day summit as a formality , as almost all of the 10 nations are set to be a lock when current nato members vote on expansion in prague november 21-22 .
" we seek a new europe that has buried its historic tensions and is prepared to meet global challenges beyond europe ’ s borders , " us president george w. bush told the assembled group per video .
the alliance ’ s expansion , the result of two years of negotiations , has grown in importance since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
proponents see the expansion as modernizing the cold war alliance into an effective terrorist-fighting organization .
" new members will help improve nato ’ s capabilities , " bush told the gathering .
baltic states latvia , lithuania and estonia , as well as slovenia , croatia , slovakia , romania and bulgaria all look to have excellent chances at getting into nato .
macedonia and albania are teetering on the edge because of continued domestic instability .
searching for a new role to enter into the alliance , candidate countries have to exhibit a commitment to democracy and push through economic and military reforms required by nato .
this weekend , talk is expected to focus on freedom of the press , corruption and fighting anti-semitism , problems that still persist in many of the candidate countries .
" we ’ re not exactly popping the champagne bottles yet , but to some extent we ’ re celebrating what will be an important historical event , " latvian foreign minister indulis berzins said in the washington post .
the expansion comes at a time when nato is still searching for its new role more than a decade after the collapse of its cold war enemy , the soviet union .
the alliance came under criticism after disastrous and ineffective bombing campaigns in yugoslavia in 1999 and revelations that it was unequipped to fight the wars of the 21st century .
at a recent nato meeting , us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged nato to close the technology gap and equip itself to fight the nuclear , chemical and biological threats of today .
some european politicians , including german chancellor challenger edmund stoiber , have advocated an increase in defense budget spending to close that gap .
stabilizing all the way to russia ’ s front door though the expansion won ’ t bring in massive or particularly advanced armies , proponents say it will stabilize a still volatile region .
washington is behind plans that would bring in funding to help countries modernize their armies and avoid depending on us military power to solve european conflicts .
russia , which joined nato as a non-voting member in may , remains wary of the eastward expansion , which will create a military alliance that rubs up against its borders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a state department official said iraq was still " preventing and delaying focus on its core obligations " . "
we see no basis or need for prolonged discussion of iraq 's obligations - they are well known " us state department over two days of negotiations in vienna , un secretary general kofi annan failed to persuade iraqi foreign minister naji sabri to allow back un weapons inspectors .
with no date set for a new meeting , mr sabri said iraq wanted a " comprehensive settlement " which would cover both un sanctions and its security .
united nations spokesman fred eckhard told the bbc that the talks had stumbled on the issue of sanctions .
" they want a little bit more assurance that the sanctions will be lifted in a reasonable timeframe , " he said .
the un security council has made the lifting of sanctions imposed after the gulf war 12 years ago conditional on iraq passing an inspection for weapons of mass destruction .
the inspectors have been barred from iraq since leaving the country in 1998 , accusing the authorities of hampering their investigations .
' nothing to discuss ' iraq asked mr annan for assurances that the united states would not take military action in the event of agreement over weapons inspections , but the secretary general made clear that this was not a matter for the un .
the bbc 's bethany bell reports that iraq is taking a major risk in focusing on a perceived us threat to overthrow its president , saddam hussein . "
the united states wants a return of inspectors to update the information they provide to their planes " naji sabri iraqi foreign minister the iraqis may be reluctant to make concessions if the american threat is genuine , she writes , but their refusal to comply with the un on the issue of arms inspections could make an american strike against iraq more likely .
us state department spokeswoman jo-anne prokopowicz said iraq 's obligations were well known and the us saw no grounds for discussing them at length .
the iraqi foreign minister accused the us of wanting to use inspectors for spying on his country .
" the united states wants a return of inspectors to update the information they provide to their planes and those of britain to strike the iraqi people , " mr sabri said .
un officials had warned not to expect too much from the meeting in vienna - the third such meeting this year .
mr eckhard noted after the meeting that relations with iraq had gradually become " more friendly , more relaxed " but mr annan conceded that , while there had been movement , it was " obviously not enough " .
sanctions the session between mr annan and mr sabri followed detailed talks by officials from both sides on how any return of inspectors would be handled on the ground .
the multinational un team wants to check accusations that iraq is developing chemical , biological or nuclear weapons .
under security council resolutions , inspectors must certify that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed , along with the long-range missiles that could deliver them .
there was one agreement made on the first day of talks when iraq agreed to return 90 % of the archives it took when it occupied kuwait in 1990 - the act that sparked the gulf war .

us state department spokeswoman jo-anne prokopowicz said iraq 's obligations were well known and the us saw no grounds for discussing them at length .
the iraqi foreign minister accused the us of wanting to use inspectors for spying on his country .
" the united states wants a return of inspectors to update the information they provide to their planes and those of britain to strike the iraqi people , " mr sabri said .
un officials had warned not to expect too much from the meeting in vienna - the third such meeting this year .
mr eckhard noted after the meeting that relations with iraq had gradually become " more friendly , more relaxed " but mr annan conceded that , while there had been movement , it was " obviously not enough " .
sanctions the session between mr annan and mr sabri followed detailed talks by officials from both sides on how any return of inspectors would be handled on the ground .
the multinational un team wants to check accusations that iraq is developing chemical , biological or nuclear weapons .
under security council resolutions , inspectors must certify that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed , along with the long-range missiles that could deliver them .
there was one agreement made on the first day of talks when iraq agreed to return 90 % of the archives it took when it occupied kuwait in 1990 - the act that sparked the gulf war . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's nick childs " the bush administration still seems to be struggling with how to deal with saddam hussein " the bbc 's greg barrow " the longer iraq delays the greater the chance the us will take the matter into their own hands " full coverage key stories us clerics oppose war saudi war warning iraq polio campaign ' new europe ' hits back analysis blair 's political troubles us and uk regroup blix tiptoes tightrope clickable guide global voices on iraq bbc world service news in arabic audio video inspectors ' report : point by point talking point your views on inspectors ' report see also : 05 jul 02 -pipe- middle east iraq-un talks set to continue 04 jul 02 -pipe- americas saddam 's stepson detained in miami 17 jun 02 -pipe- americas pre-emption - new us policy on iraq internet links : iraqi presidency un mission to iraq us state department the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top middle east stories now : us draws up second iraq resolution mid-east peace moves urged saudis launch first al-qaeda trial palestinian gas mask appeal dismissed kuwait protests over iraq statement polio campaign launched in iraq iran academic sent back to death court jerusalem gets ultra-orthodox mayor links to more middle east stories are at the foot of the page .

"
there will not be any coup d 'etat in ivory coast " president laurent gbagbo " we are in a period when , naturally , tempers are running high , " the president said in a nationwide tv address .
" i am speaking to reassure all those who have shown us friendship , " he said .
" there will not be any coup d 'etat in ivory coast - not in 10 days , 100 days or in 1,000 days " .
mr gbagbo said he had instructed the army and police to maintain law and order for sunday 's polling .
" anyone who wants to cause trouble on election day should be arrested and handed over to the courts . "
voter eligibility the ivorian leader acknowledged recent incidents including clashes in the central cocoa-producing town of daloa which left six dead , sparked by anger over who would be eligible to vote .
the country 's election commission has ruled that only those holding official identity cards can vote , but the process of issuing identification papers is not expected to be completed until the end of 2003 .
political opponents of mr gbagbo 's ruling ivorian popular front -lrb- fpi -rrb- party allege that identity cards are being issued to his supporters in an attempt to rig the poll .
mr gbagbo rejected opposition calls for voters to be allowed to show other forms of identity paper , such as their birth certificates or driving licence , as in previous elections .
he said 75 % of the driving licences in ivory coast are held by foreigners who do not have voting rights under the ivorian constitution .
" we will adhere to the documents requested by the election commission , " he said .
emotions run high tensions in an already volatile situation rose further after last week 's judicial decision to grant ivorian nationality papers to alassane ouattara , the main opposition leader .
mr ouattara , the former prime minister from the mainly muslim north , was prevented from contesting the 2000 elections which brought mr gbagbo to power , on grounds of nationality - a move that led to a series of tribal clashes leaving more than 300 dead .
mr gbagbo played down last week 's decision , acknowledging , however , that it " raised a lot of emotions among ivorians to such an extent that i could not understand what had happened to my country and my people . "
sunday 's local elections , he said , were " the most important thing at the moment " because it was the local councils that would bring schools , drinking water , telephones and medical services to communities .
" i will not allow myself to be distracted and i do not want the ivorian people to succumb to distractions , " he said .

the screening of pornographic films is currently illegal in india , but virtually every city has theatres which do so .

mr trimble was speaking on saturday as a major security operation was due to get under way ahead of sunday 's controversial orange order march .
the parades commission upheld its drumcree decision on friday , banning the orange order from walking on the garvaghy road in portadown .
the orange order had sought a review of the determination on the drumcree parade , which was announced earlier this week .
it is the fifth successive year the parade has been barred from taking this route .
the decision came as the police officer in charge of security at drumcree said he believed there was less likelihood of trouble at the march this year .
the order wants to use the route on its return journey from a somme commemoration service at drumcree parish church , but the march is opposed by nationalist residents .

the company will transfer 1,000 staff from its existing hillington factory to the new 50,000 sq m state-of-the-art plant .
rolls-royce considered nine different sites for the facility before choosing inchinnan - a decision that was made subject to planning permission .
we can press ahead with building a new centre of excellence for aerospace component manufacturing in scotland royan anthony rolls-royce it has now emerged that the scottish executive will not call in the proposals , a step which can delay the process by several months .
that decision was welcomed by divisional managing director royan anthony , who said : " this is great news for scotland as well as for rolls-royce and its workforce at hillington .
" now we can press ahead with building a new centre of excellence for aerospace component manufacturing in scotland .
" i would like to thank the scottish executive , renfrewshire council for granting us planning permission and scottish enterprise for its support throughout this process . "
work on the building - which should take 10 months to complete - is expected to start shortly .
the plant is to be built near glasgow airport employees and equipment will be transferred from hillington between 2003 and 2005 .
the company announced in june that inchinnan was its favoured site as the replacement for hillington , a plant which dates back more than 60 years .
it was built during wwii as a factory for merlin engines , which powered battle of britain spitfires and hurricanes .
the new factory , which is being sited on a brownfield site , will make components which go into the majority of the company 's gas turbines used in the civil aerospace , defence , marine and energy markets .
rolls-royce said inchinnan had proven the most attractive location for the highly-skilled hillington workforce , most of whom live locally .
managers also said it had good transport links and that it could be made available in the required time .
