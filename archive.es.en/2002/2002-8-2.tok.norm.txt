the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .
deniz yilmaz was one of the first employees with a green card at ericsson .
for her , the new regulations came as a pleasant surprise .
the green card process smoothed her transition from istanbul student to technology worker in germany while her company took care of most of the paperwork .
what next for the card in the current political climate ?
so , two years of the green card have brought mutual benefits and problems to all those involved ; employers and employees alike .
with immigration high on the policy list of politicians all over europe at the moment , who can tell what changes the next two years will have in store for current and prospective card carriers ? send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green cards to germany - immigration streamlined august 1st 2000 and germany ’ s green card programme has been running for over a year .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .

despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .
the station is now operated by independent british news producer itn , but national public broadcasters in spain , portugal , italy , france and finland are also contributors . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2002 bayer sees no sign of recovery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no amount of medicine can help -stricken german pharmaceutical giant bayer ag after posting second-quarter results that were well below analysts ’ expectations , the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it saw no reason to expect a turnaround before the end of 2002 . “ we do not have any indication of a tangible upturn in the current year ” , chief executive of bayer werner wenning said on thursday .
but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .
bayer ’ s cyclical chemicals and polymer division also sees no signs of recovery .
instead , the battle for market share has resulted in clear price-reductions , which in turn led to a sharp drop in revenue and profit .
the only positive element in bayer ’ s results , as westlb analyst andreas theisen pointed out , was the group ’ s low debt level .
in the course of the first half , wenning was able to reduce debts from 15 billion euro to 12.1 billion euro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .
bayer ’ s cyclical chemicals and polymer division also sees no signs of recovery .
instead , the battle for market share has resulted in clear price-reductions , which in turn led to a sharp drop in revenue and profit .
the only positive element in bayer ’ s results , as westlb analyst andreas theisen pointed out , was the group ’ s low debt level .
in the course of the first half , wenning was able to reduce debts from 15 billion euro to 12.1 billion euro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "
in december , the german government banned the first radical group since the september 11 attacks - the union of islamic associations .
this organisation was led by the radical metin kaplan , who was convicted of incitement of murder last year .
but the government has so far been unsuccessful in deporting its members . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .
the station is now operated by independent british news producer itn , but national public broadcasters in spain , portugal , italy , france and finland are also contributors . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2002 bayer sees no sign of recovery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no amount of medicine can help -stricken german pharmaceutical giant bayer ag after posting second-quarter results that were well below analysts ’ expectations , the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it saw no reason to expect a turnaround before the end of 2002 . “ we do not have any indication of a tangible upturn in the current year ” , chief executive of bayer werner wenning said on thursday .
but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .
alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .
those angered by the senate 's decree say that if mr berlusconi argued that the judges were biased , he might be able to get the trial restarted - at which point the statute of limitations might dictate that he be acquitted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.08.2002 a franco-german media cooperation for europe 's sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right kind of programming might help protect the " european consciousness " at the end of this week 's franco-german summit , france and germany 's most-senior cultural officials call for expanding joint media projects in order to build support for the european union . french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder met in the eastern german city of schwerin earlier this week to focus on pesky issues , such as european agricultural reform , that have been a thorn in their countries ' relationship .
but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "
in december , the german government banned the first radical group since the september 11 attacks - the union of islamic associations .
this organisation was led by the radical metin kaplan , who was convicted of incitement of murder last year .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .

the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .

alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .
alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .
those angered by the senate 's decree say that if mr berlusconi argued that the judges were biased , he might be able to get the trial restarted - at which point the statute of limitations might dictate that he be acquitted .
current let off joins list of skillful escapes the statute of limitations has extinguished charges in three other criminal trials involving mr berlusconi .
italy 's richest man has weathered legal storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
mr berlusconi 's first period as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
three previous convictions for corruption and fraud have been overturned on appeal .
italians are united in the need to improve italy 's slow , muddled judicial system , but many suspect that the government 's reform initiatives are being used as a cover to kill corruption cases , including charges of false accounting and tax evasion levelled at members of the ruling party .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "
in december , the german government banned the first radical group since the september 11 attacks - the union of islamic associations .
this organisation was led by the radical metin kaplan , who was convicted of incitement of murder last year .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .
deniz yilmaz was one of the first employees with a green card at ericsson .
for her , the new regulations came as a pleasant surprise .
the green card process smoothed her transition from istanbul student to technology worker in germany while her company took care of most of the paperwork .
what next for the card in the current political climate ?
so , two years of the green card have brought mutual benefits and problems to all those involved ; employers and employees alike .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "
in december , the german government banned the first radical group since the september 11 attacks - the union of islamic associations .
this organisation was led by the radical metin kaplan , who was convicted of incitement of murder last year .
but the government has so far been unsuccessful in deporting its members . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 italian premier let off the hook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : master at getting his way : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi italy 's prime minister , silvio berlusconi , owes a debt of thanks to his country 's senate as it backed a law that would provide him immunity against a new wave of corruption allegations . in a move that would have delighted master escape artist harry houdini , berlusconi escaped the prospect of damaging and potentially explosive court proceedings when italy 's senate backed a law that opposition members say will help the premier avoid corruption charges .
to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .
alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .
those angered by the senate 's decree say that if mr berlusconi argued that the judges were biased , he might be able to get the trial restarted - at which point the statute of limitations might dictate that he be acquitted .
current let off joins list of skillful escapes the statute of limitations has extinguished charges in three other criminal trials involving mr berlusconi .
italy 's richest man has weathered legal storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
mr berlusconi 's first period as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
three previous convictions for corruption and fraud have been overturned on appeal .
italians are united in the need to improve italy 's slow , muddled judicial system , but many suspect that the government 's reform initiatives are being used as a cover to kill corruption cases , including charges of false accounting and tax evasion levelled at members of the ruling party .
in addition to this most recent bill , berlusconi 's coalition has effectively decriminalised false accounting and passed a law impeding the exchange of financial information between swiss and italian magistrates . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .
bayer ’ s cyclical chemicals and polymer division also sees no signs of recovery .
instead , the battle for market share has resulted in clear price-reductions , which in turn led to a sharp drop in revenue and profit .
the only positive element in bayer ’ s results , as westlb analyst andreas theisen pointed out , was the group ’ s low debt level .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "
in december , the german government banned the first radical group since the september 11 attacks - the union of islamic associations .
this organisation was led by the radical metin kaplan , who was convicted of incitement of murder last year .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .
deniz yilmaz was one of the first employees with a green card at ericsson .
for her , the new regulations came as a pleasant surprise .
the green card process smoothed her transition from istanbul student to technology worker in germany while her company took care of most of the paperwork .
what next for the card in the current political climate ?
so , two years of the green card have brought mutual benefits and problems to all those involved ; employers and employees alike .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .
deniz yilmaz was one of the first employees with a green card at ericsson .
for her , the new regulations came as a pleasant surprise .
the green card process smoothed her transition from istanbul student to technology worker in germany while her company took care of most of the paperwork .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "
in december , the german government banned the first radical group since the september 11 attacks - the union of islamic associations .
this organisation was led by the radical metin kaplan , who was convicted of incitement of murder last year .
but the government has so far been unsuccessful in deporting its members . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .
alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .
those angered by the senate 's decree say that if mr berlusconi argued that the judges were biased , he might be able to get the trial restarted - at which point the statute of limitations might dictate that he be acquitted .
current let off joins list of skillful escapes the statute of limitations has extinguished charges in three other criminal trials involving mr berlusconi .
italy 's richest man has weathered legal storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
mr berlusconi 's first period as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
three previous convictions for corruption and fraud have been overturned on appeal .
italians are united in the need to improve italy 's slow , muddled judicial system , but many suspect that the government 's reform initiatives are being used as a cover to kill corruption cases , including charges of false accounting and tax evasion levelled at members of the ruling party .
in addition to this most recent bill , berlusconi 's coalition has effectively decriminalised false accounting and passed a law impeding the exchange of financial information between swiss and italian magistrates . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .
the station is now operated by independent british news producer itn , but national public broadcasters in spain , portugal , italy , france and finland are also contributors . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "
in december , the german government banned the first radical group since the september 11 attacks - the union of islamic associations .
this organisation was led by the radical metin kaplan , who was convicted of incitement of murder last year .
but the government has so far been unsuccessful in deporting its members . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 italian premier let off the hook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : master at getting his way : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi italy 's prime minister , silvio berlusconi , owes a debt of thanks to his country 's senate as it backed a law that would provide him immunity against a new wave of corruption allegations . in a move that would have delighted master escape artist harry houdini , berlusconi escaped the prospect of damaging and potentially explosive court proceedings when italy 's senate backed a law that opposition members say will help the premier avoid corruption charges .
to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "
in december , the german government banned the first radical group since the september 11 attacks - the union of islamic associations .
this organisation was led by the radical metin kaplan , who was convicted of incitement of murder last year .
but the government has so far been unsuccessful in deporting its members . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .
bayer ’ s cyclical chemicals and polymer division also sees no signs of recovery .
instead , the battle for market share has resulted in clear price-reductions , which in turn led to a sharp drop in revenue and profit .
the only positive element in bayer ’ s results , as westlb analyst andreas theisen pointed out , was the group ’ s low debt level .
in the course of the first half , wenning was able to reduce debts from 15 billion euro to 12.1 billion euro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .
the station is now operated by independent british news producer itn , but national public broadcasters in spain , portugal , italy , france and finland are also contributors . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .
alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .
those angered by the senate 's decree say that if mr berlusconi argued that the judges were biased , he might be able to get the trial restarted - at which point the statute of limitations might dictate that he be acquitted .
current let off joins list of skillful escapes the statute of limitations has extinguished charges in three other criminal trials involving mr berlusconi .
italy 's richest man has weathered legal storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
mr berlusconi 's first period as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
three previous convictions for corruption and fraud have been overturned on appeal .
italians are united in the need to improve italy 's slow , muddled judicial system , but many suspect that the government 's reform initiatives are being used as a cover to kill corruption cases , including charges of false accounting and tax evasion levelled at members of the ruling party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.08.2002 a franco-german media cooperation for europe 's sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right kind of programming might help protect the " european consciousness " at the end of this week 's franco-german summit , france and germany 's most-senior cultural officials call for expanding joint media projects in order to build support for the european union . french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder met in the eastern german city of schwerin earlier this week to focus on pesky issues , such as european agricultural reform , that have been a thorn in their countries ' relationship .
but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .
the station is now operated by independent british news producer itn , but national public broadcasters in spain , portugal , italy , france and finland are also contributors . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .
deniz yilmaz was one of the first employees with a green card at ericsson .
for her , the new regulations came as a pleasant surprise .
the green card process smoothed her transition from istanbul student to technology worker in germany while her company took care of most of the paperwork .
what next for the card in the current political climate ?

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .
bayer ’ s cyclical chemicals and polymer division also sees no signs of recovery .
instead , the battle for market share has resulted in clear price-reductions , which in turn led to a sharp drop in revenue and profit .
the only positive element in bayer ’ s results , as westlb analyst andreas theisen pointed out , was the group ’ s low debt level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 italian premier let off the hook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : master at getting his way : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi italy 's prime minister , silvio berlusconi , owes a debt of thanks to his country 's senate as it backed a law that would provide him immunity against a new wave of corruption allegations . in a move that would have delighted master escape artist harry houdini , berlusconi escaped the prospect of damaging and potentially explosive court proceedings when italy 's senate backed a law that opposition members say will help the premier avoid corruption charges .
to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .
alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .
those angered by the senate 's decree say that if mr berlusconi argued that the judges were biased , he might be able to get the trial restarted - at which point the statute of limitations might dictate that he be acquitted .
current let off joins list of skillful escapes the statute of limitations has extinguished charges in three other criminal trials involving mr berlusconi .
italy 's richest man has weathered legal storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
mr berlusconi 's first period as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
three previous convictions for corruption and fraud have been overturned on appeal .
italians are united in the need to improve italy 's slow , muddled judicial system , but many suspect that the government 's reform initiatives are being used as a cover to kill corruption cases , including charges of false accounting and tax evasion levelled at members of the ruling party .
in addition to this most recent bill , berlusconi 's coalition has effectively decriminalised false accounting and passed a law impeding the exchange of financial information between swiss and italian magistrates . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .
the station is now operated by independent british news producer itn , but national public broadcasters in spain , portugal , italy , france and finland are also contributors . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .

the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .

instead , the battle for market share has resulted in clear price-reductions , which in turn led to a sharp drop in revenue and profit .
the only positive element in bayer ’ s results , as westlb analyst andreas theisen pointed out , was the group ’ s low debt level .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .
deniz yilmaz was one of the first employees with a green card at ericsson .
for her , the new regulations came as a pleasant surprise .
the green card process smoothed her transition from istanbul student to technology worker in germany while her company took care of most of the paperwork .
what next for the card in the current political climate ?
so , two years of the green card have brought mutual benefits and problems to all those involved ; employers and employees alike .
with immigration high on the policy list of politicians all over europe at the moment , who can tell what changes the next two years will have in store for current and prospective card carriers ? send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green cards to germany - immigration streamlined august 1st 2000 and germany ’ s green card programme has been running for over a year .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "
in december , the german government banned the first radical group since the september 11 attacks - the union of islamic associations .
this organisation was led by the radical metin kaplan , who was convicted of incitement of murder last year .
but the government has so far been unsuccessful in deporting its members . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections bringing 9/11 horror to berlin fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2002 germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic extremists have fans in germany : a father and his daughter at a berlin demonstration in april the recent bomb attack on jerusalem university by the radical islamic group hamas , has led to fresh calls for a ban of hamas and hizbollah on german soil .
but under german law , this may prove a daunting task . recent reports that the islamic militant group hizbollah wants to open up shop in germany has led to widespread concern that the violence of the middle east could spread to german soil . the radical shi 'ite group , formed in lebanon in 1982 , has become notorious for its suicide bombings , hostage takings and the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet .
in recent years , it has launched sporadic border attacks against the israeli army .
so far , there have n't been any attacks on german soil and chancellor gerhard schröder 's government wants to keep it that way .
but efforts to keep the hizbollah from opening up a koran school and training center in berlin are likely to fail .
the reason : germany 's constitution only allows groups to banned if they are proven to have violated german laws .
the bind is an especially embarassing one for germany , where investigators say the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington were planned .
groups " do not belong here " in the past year , the government has been actively trying to crack down on groups like hamas and hizbollah , which officials estimate have a membership list of 3,000 members in germany .
günther beckstein , the current bavarian interior minister and possible federal interior minister after the sept . 22 elections , told der spiegel magazine earlier this week that hizbollah and hamas were " clearly groups , who use violence abroad . "
" these kind of groups do not belong here , " he said .
the sentiment is echoed by professor paul wilkinson of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence in st. andrews .
" it should surely be possible surely to count terrorist activity as serious violation to criminal law , " he told dw-radio .
" one would think german parliament could amend the law to ensure those organisations involved in terrorism were excluded from operating and opening support offices in germany . "
under observation , but that 's it both the us and britain have already banned the organisation in their countries , and israel ’ s ambassador to germany schimon stein is pressing germany 's government to do the same .
a government spokesman told reporters recently that both groups were under observation and that interior ministers on both state and federal level were collecting material on the organisations .
dw-radio 's middle east expert peter philipp said european branches are important for hizbollah .
the organizations recruit interest from foreign islamic and arabic populations and provide both moral and financial support .
extremist organizations grew in 2001 the latest report on extremist activity released in may by germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency showed the government faced a long battle in the fight against terrorism .
figures from the federal office for the protection of the constitution showed that the number of foreign extremists living in germany had increased from 58,800 in 2000 to 59,100 in 2001 , the majority being islamic extremists .
" islamic organisations are no longer interested in just creating an islamic societal order in their country of origin , " interior minister otto schily warned after the report was released in may .
" increasingly , they want to transplant their political and religious ideas to germany . "
in december , the german government banned the first radical group since the september 11 attacks - the union of islamic associations .
this organisation was led by the radical metin kaplan , who was convicted of incitement of murder last year .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .
alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .
those angered by the senate 's decree say that if mr berlusconi argued that the judges were biased , he might be able to get the trial restarted - at which point the statute of limitations might dictate that he be acquitted .
current let off joins list of skillful escapes the statute of limitations has extinguished charges in three other criminal trials involving mr berlusconi .
italy 's richest man has weathered legal storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
mr berlusconi 's first period as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
three previous convictions for corruption and fraud have been overturned on appeal .
italians are united in the need to improve italy 's slow , muddled judicial system , but many suspect that the government 's reform initiatives are being used as a cover to kill corruption cases , including charges of false accounting and tax evasion levelled at members of the ruling party .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .
alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .
those angered by the senate 's decree say that if mr berlusconi argued that the judges were biased , he might be able to get the trial restarted - at which point the statute of limitations might dictate that he be acquitted .
current let off joins list of skillful escapes the statute of limitations has extinguished charges in three other criminal trials involving mr berlusconi .
italy 's richest man has weathered legal storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
mr berlusconi 's first period as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
three previous convictions for corruption and fraud have been overturned on appeal .
italians are united in the need to improve italy 's slow , muddled judicial system , but many suspect that the government 's reform initiatives are being used as a cover to kill corruption cases , including charges of false accounting and tax evasion levelled at members of the ruling party .
in addition to this most recent bill , berlusconi 's coalition has effectively decriminalised false accounting and passed a law impeding the exchange of financial information between swiss and italian magistrates . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .
bayer ’ s cyclical chemicals and polymer division also sees no signs of recovery .
instead , the battle for market share has resulted in clear price-reductions , which in turn led to a sharp drop in revenue and profit .
the only positive element in bayer ’ s results , as westlb analyst andreas theisen pointed out , was the group ’ s low debt level .
in the course of the first half , wenning was able to reduce debts from 15 billion euro to 12.1 billion euro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .
deniz yilmaz was one of the first employees with a green card at ericsson .
for her , the new regulations came as a pleasant surprise .
the green card process smoothed her transition from istanbul student to technology worker in germany while her company took care of most of the paperwork .
what next for the card in the current political climate ?
so , two years of the green card have brought mutual benefits and problems to all those involved ; employers and employees alike .
with immigration high on the policy list of politicians all over europe at the moment , who can tell what changes the next two years will have in store for current and prospective card carriers ? send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green cards to germany - immigration streamlined august 1st 2000 and germany ’ s green card programme has been running for over a year .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .
the station is now operated by independent british news producer itn , but national public broadcasters in spain , portugal , italy , france and finland are also contributors . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .
bayer ’ s cyclical chemicals and polymer division also sees no signs of recovery .
instead , the battle for market share has resulted in clear price-reductions , which in turn led to a sharp drop in revenue and profit .
the only positive element in bayer ’ s results , as westlb analyst andreas theisen pointed out , was the group ’ s low debt level .
in the course of the first half , wenning was able to reduce debts from 15 billion euro to 12.1 billion euro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .
bayer ’ s cyclical chemicals and polymer division also sees no signs of recovery .
instead , the battle for market share has resulted in clear price-reductions , which in turn led to a sharp drop in revenue and profit .
the only positive element in bayer ’ s results , as westlb analyst andreas theisen pointed out , was the group ’ s low debt level .
in the course of the first half , wenning was able to reduce debts from 15 billion euro to 12.1 billion euro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .
deniz yilmaz was one of the first employees with a green card at ericsson .
for her , the new regulations came as a pleasant surprise .
the green card process smoothed her transition from istanbul student to technology worker in germany while her company took care of most of the paperwork .
what next for the card in the current political climate ?
so , two years of the green card have brought mutual benefits and problems to all those involved ; employers and employees alike .
with immigration high on the policy list of politicians all over europe at the moment , who can tell what changes the next two years will have in store for current and prospective card carriers ? send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green cards to germany - immigration streamlined august 1st 2000 and germany ’ s green card programme has been running for over a year .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .
alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .
those angered by the senate 's decree say that if mr berlusconi argued that the judges were biased , he might be able to get the trial restarted - at which point the statute of limitations might dictate that he be acquitted .
current let off joins list of skillful escapes the statute of limitations has extinguished charges in three other criminal trials involving mr berlusconi .
italy 's richest man has weathered legal storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
mr berlusconi 's first period as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
three previous convictions for corruption and fraud have been overturned on appeal .
italians are united in the need to improve italy 's slow , muddled judicial system , but many suspect that the government 's reform initiatives are being used as a cover to kill corruption cases , including charges of false accounting and tax evasion levelled at members of the ruling party .
in addition to this most recent bill , berlusconi 's coalition has effectively decriminalised false accounting and passed a law impeding the exchange of financial information between swiss and italian magistrates . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .

such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .
the station is now operated by independent british news producer itn , but national public broadcasters in spain , portugal , italy , france and finland are also contributors . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2002 bayer sees no sign of recovery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no amount of medicine can help -stricken german pharmaceutical giant bayer ag after posting second-quarter results that were well below analysts ’ expectations , the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it saw no reason to expect a turnaround before the end of 2002 . “ we do not have any indication of a tangible upturn in the current year ” , chief executive of bayer werner wenning said on thursday .
but he still upheld his target of raising net profit in 2002 , which bayer expects to do purely through the proceeds from divestments .
analysts said that almost all aspects of bayer ’ s second-quarter results had disappointed .
group revenue fell 7 percent to 7.2 billion euro while operating profit before one-off items slumped 41 percent to 318 million euro .
net profit , despite extraordinary income from the sale of bayer ’ s remaining shares in photographics group agfa-gevaert , totaled just 293 million euro , a drop of 48 percent from the year-ago period .
the group ’ s poor showing was not only a result of the weak economy and price decreases but also of the sharp downturn in bayer ’ s healthcare division .
the unit continues to grapple with the loss of the anti-cholesterol drug lipobay , which it took off the market around a year go after it was linked to several deaths .
the economic crises in argentina and brazil also weighed heavily on bayer ’ s results . “ the figures are disappointing almost throughout , ” said ulrich huwald , analyst at m.m. warburg .
the markets responded accordingly .
shares in bayer tumbled 5 percent on the news , and even deteriorated a little more as the session progressed .
they closed down 5.75 percent at 23.75 euro .
wenning said that bayer is undergoing “ a transitional year , during which it will lay the foundation for future growth ” .
but for this growth to materialize , the economy will have to pick up and the problems at bayer ’ s healthcare division will have to be resolved .
healthcare revenue alone was down 11 percent to 4.8 billion euro in the first half , while operating profit fell 16 percent to 440 million euro .
“ the return is highly unsatisfactory , ” wenning conceded .
it currently stands at a 9.2 percent , considerably weaker than the rates obtained by its rivals .
among the factors weighing on the division is growing competition from copycat drugs for its bloodpressure treatment adalat , while the business with prescription-free drugs like aspirin is feeling the impact from the latin america crisis .
generic drug revenue declined 10 percent .
the currency crises in argentina and brazil shaved off some 60 million euro from the first-half profit of bayer ’ s cropscience unit .
bayer ’ s recent acquisition of aventis cropscience has increased its exposure to the region still further . “ the weak results of the acgrochemicals business are the biggest surprise among bayer ’ s figures , ” said ludger mues , analyst at bank sal .
oppenheim .
the division ’ s return on sales , which once stood proud at 22 percent , was just 8.4 percent in the first six months , with high integration costs and write-downs contributing to the decline .
bayer ’ s cyclical chemicals and polymer division also sees no signs of recovery .
instead , the battle for market share has resulted in clear price-reductions , which in turn led to a sharp drop in revenue and profit .
the only positive element in bayer ’ s results , as westlb analyst andreas theisen pointed out , was the group ’ s low debt level .
in the course of the first half , wenning was able to reduce debts from 15 billion euro to 12.1 billion euro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .
bill allows accused to move courts if bias is alleged the bill will allow defendants to request that court cases be annulled or moved to another court if they have a ' legitimate suspicion ' that the judges are biased against them .
opponents say the bill , which would apply to current court cases , is a ploy by mr berlusconi to escape the courts .
the prime minister 's centre-right coalition has a solid parliamentary majority and appeared unfazed by claims that it was trying to get its leader off the hook .
it said the bill would bolster the civil rights of italians by making trials fairer .
further allegations to be faced by forza italia leader berlusconi also faces trial in milan later this year on charges of bribing a judge to win control of sme , a state-owned food conglomerate , in 1985 .
alongside him will be his former aide and lawmaker cesare previti , unless the new bill is finally passed in september enabling both men to shrug off these further allegations of wrongdoing .
berlusconi and previti say they are innocent and have asked for the trial to be moved from milan , where the right wing politicians say they would not get a fair hearing because of the judges ' alleged left-wing sympathies .
those angered by the senate 's decree say that if mr berlusconi argued that the judges were biased , he might be able to get the trial restarted - at which point the statute of limitations might dictate that he be acquitted .
current let off joins list of skillful escapes the statute of limitations has extinguished charges in three other criminal trials involving mr berlusconi .
italy 's richest man has weathered legal storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
mr berlusconi 's first period as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
three previous convictions for corruption and fraud have been overturned on appeal .
italians are united in the need to improve italy 's slow , muddled judicial system , but many suspect that the government 's reform initiatives are being used as a cover to kill corruption cases , including charges of false accounting and tax evasion levelled at members of the ruling party .
in addition to this most recent bill , berlusconi 's coalition has effectively decriminalised false accounting and passed a law impeding the exchange of financial information between swiss and italian magistrates . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the green card turns two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cumbersome bureacracy and long queues a thing of the past for greencard holders in germany germany 's radical experiment to bail out its flagging information technology industry turned two on thursday , showing mixed results . two years ago , germany 's information technology sector was in a bind .
thousands of positions were available , but no german qualified enough to fill them .
so chancellor gerhard schröder 's government looked east - far east .
the result : the green card program , a radical change to the country 's immigration policies which sought to bring in thousands of qualified it experts , mainly from central asian countries such as india .
on thursday , august 1 , the green card officially turned two .
some 8,500 foreign it experts are currently working in germany , far below the tens of thousands germany had envisioned , but an encouraging number nonetheless .
the new immigrants benefit from a radically streamlined immigration process schröder 's government set up for bringing non-eu nationals to work in the it field .
upon arrival , they are offered five years unrestricted employment in a country famous for its stiff immigration policy . booming industry cooled off , what now ?
at the time of the introduction , german firms estimated they needed roughly 200,000 new foreign employees a year to keep up with the then-booming industry .
but the present miserable state of the it industry across the globe , and particularly in germany , means that although many companies have been taking advantage of the programme by filling vacant positions , lack of business has left many green card holders twiddling their thumbs .
apart from the weak job market and downturn in the economy , the successful applicant faces many problems .
a different lifestyle , a different culture , and for many , a difficult language .
many arrive without being able to speak german , and although the government has introduced schemes and conditions to ensure workers learn and have a working knowledge of the native tongue , the first few months can be hard .
above all , green card holders have had to get used to a different way of life by moving to germany .
" people 's attitudes are a problem " those who have found work through the green card programme have had varying experiences as part of the german workforce .
salman mahmood has been working with internet company mercateo in munich since 2000 .
after working in britain and the united states , he has found his integration into german society to be difficult .
" i find that people 's attitudes are a problem " , mahmood told dw-world .
" you do n't see many friendly faces here .
that was completely different in england and the us .
if that doesn ’ t change , foreign experts just wo n't want to come to work in germany . "
personal experiences aside , the green card programme has made life easier for many workers and companies alike by dispensing with much of the bureaucracy that dogged the previous immigration process .
bettina karsten , from the human resources department at telecommunications giant ericsson deutschland gmbh , has had more positive experiences with the green card scheme .
" we used to wait for months for the proper papers , and now we have them in one or two weeks , " she said .
deniz yilmaz was one of the first employees with a green card at ericsson .
for her , the new regulations came as a pleasant surprise .
the green card process smoothed her transition from istanbul student to technology worker in germany while her company took care of most of the paperwork .
what next for the card in the current political climate ?
so , two years of the green card have brought mutual benefits and problems to all those involved ; employers and employees alike .
with immigration high on the policy list of politicians all over europe at the moment , who can tell what changes the next two years will have in store for current and prospective card carriers ? send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green cards to germany - immigration streamlined august 1st 2000 and germany ’ s green card programme has been running for over a year .

to the raucous cries of " shame " from his opponents , the forza italia leader walked away relatively spotless from the italian upper chamber after a tempestuous debate in which the bill was passed by 162 votes to nine .
the bill will now go to the lower house , the chamber of deputies , for final passage in early september .
dozens of opposition members of parliament walked out before the vote , while others wore blindfolds in protest .
as discussions continued in earnest , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the senate and were joined by politicians who walked out of the chamber .
opponents told the waiting italian media that the bill had been rushed through the senate on the eve of parliament 's summer recess as a favour to the prime minister .

but in the shadow of the pressing political issues , france and germany 's highest cultural policy appointees met to discuss a more successful arena of the franco-german relationship : joint media efforts .
at the close of the summit , schröder 's cultural affairs advisor , julian nida-rümelin , and french cultural minister jean-jacques aillagon issued a joint statement calling for greater pan-european media cooperation .
such tandem efforts , nida-rümelin said , are crucial in light of a trend of " dramatic nationalization " occurring across the continent .
" increasingly , the european consciousness is disappearing in the minds of many , " he warned .
one of the key tools for creating a public that views itself as " european , " he said , is to support international television programming .
supporting a belief , not matter the cost as a first example , nida-rümelin cited arte , the bilingual joint french-german television station that has broadcast the best of public television in both lands for the past 10 years .
the countries currently spend more than 325 million euro -lrb- $ 319.9 million -rrb- a year to produce arte .
despite the fact that arte only draws a 1 percent audience share in germany , and 3 percent in france , the cultural advisor described it as a success and said that it should be expanded to include other european union countries , especially the eastern european accession states .
deutsche welle and radio france international , the countries ' foreign broadcast services , also provide opportunities to develop a common european voice , the cultural leaders said .
a franco-german broadcasting cooperation nida-rümelin argued that the current restructuring of deutsche welle provided the opportunity to open up a debate over how the broadcaster could better cooperate to develop programming with its neighbor in order to provide a unified voice on european issues for broadcast in other regions of the world .
deutsche welle currently operates with an annual budget of 285 million euro ; radio france international receives 130 million euro in funding .
aillagon also suggested that both countries should work more closely with euronews , the joint news channel founded by a handful of leading european public broadcasters in 1993 .
the station is now operated by independent british news producer itn , but national public broadcasters in spain , portugal , italy , france and finland are also contributors . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it is shaped a little like a pumpkin - wider at the middle and narrower at the poles .
it is a difference of more than 20 kilometres .
but now new research published in the journal science suggests our planet is getting even wider - if only by the odd millimetre .
the scientists behind the report , christopher cox and benjamin chao , base their findings on space-based observations from past 25 years .
abrupt change since the early 1980s , satellite laser-ranging studies that have been used to work out the planet 's gravity field have demonstrated how the earth has lost a bit of its pumpkin look - it has actually become slightly more spherical .
this has been put down to a rebound effect in the mantle - a thick layer of nearly molten rock between the earth 's crust and its core - following the loss of the heavy mass of ice at the poles after the last ice age .
but cox and chao say their work suggests this trend reversed abruptly about four years ago .
they are doubtful that phenomena such as further glacial melting or atmospheric changes can explain the rapid turnabout .
small measurement instead , they suggest two possibilities .
one is that changes in ocean circulation have shifted a larger mass of water towards equatorial regions ; the other is that there has been a shift in mass at the boundary between the earth 's fluid outer core and the mantle .
further studies will be required to work out what is really happening .
cox says any increase in the earth 's girth is of the order of millimetres and may even be imperceptible given the rather technical way these things are monitored .
" it depends on where the effect is , because it is measured in terms of a change in the shape of the gravity field , " he says .
" if it is in the ocean , it may be a few millimetres , but if it is in the core there could be no apparent change in the actual shape of the earth . "

this far exceeds original estimates outlined by the government last week during its announcement of possible expansion plans at heathrow and other uk airports .
it said then that only 260 homes would have to be demolished to make way for a new 2,000-metre runway in west london .
however , notes on air quality , which form part of the consultation documents issued at the time of the announcement , say people exposed to pollution above eu limits may also have their homes pulled down .
locals in west london oppose any expansion the times reports that the document for the south-east states : " by 2015 some 35,000 people could be exposed to an exceedence of the annual average eu limit for nitrogen dioxide if a third runway was built . "
this could be reduced to 5,000 people , but only if the aviation industry makes much faster improvements in engine technology .

the airlines would have to provide reassurances they were dealing with the pollution issue if they are to make the case for the new runway .
this could include responsibility for the cost of funding the purchase and demolition - where necessary - of properties , although they are likely to argue that compensation should come from the government .

president george w bush had asked lawmakers for the extra funding to pay for his ongoing war on terror .
subject to final approval , the overall defence budget for the next financial year will be more than $ 350bn .
america already spends more on defence than any nation in history .
its military budget exceeds the combined spending of its nine closest competitors and now there is more on the way .
with little debate and by 95 votes to three , the senate approved this package .
the money will pay for helicopters , cargo aircraft , four new warships and a replacement for the crusader cannon , which is considered too heavy for modern warfare .
there is also a 4 % pay rise for all defence personnel .
that represents almost everything on the president 's military shopping list .
the only dissenting note was the decision by senators to withhold a $ 10bn wartime contingency fund , which mr bush would control .
that is perhaps a reminder to the white house that lawmakers will not be overlooked when it comes to the debate on possible military action against iraq .
ultimately though , mr bush can expect to get his contingency fund when the defence bill gets final approval from both houses of congress in the autumn .

this comes in the wake of us findings linking another widely-used combination to an increased risk of heart disease , cancer and stroke .
experts fear that many women may be confused by conflicting messages about hrt and abandon it altogether .
hundreds of thousands of women in the uk use hrt to relieve menopausal and post-menopausal symptoms .
it can help reduce the incidence of hot flushes and sweating , as well as protect bone density , so reducing the chances of osteoporosis later in life .
the latest study , carried out by researchers at the university of sheffield and john radcliffe hospital in oxford , looked at a combination of oestrogen and progestogen , marketed in the uk under the name kliofem .
this is not the same combination studied in the us trial . "
we have to explain to women that taking any type of hrt is likely to carry risks , while making them aware of the considerable benefits involved as well " mr malcolm whitehead , king 's college hospital it looked at the progress of more than 500 women over a period of five years .
none of the women in the study develop endometrial cancer - which affects the lining of the womb , or even showed signs of precancerous cell changes in that area .
a few women who showed signs of these changes prior to the start of the study were checked again at the end - and no sign of the problem could be found .
the researchers believe that women on this type of hrt are better protected against endometrial cancer than those taking no hrt at all .
risk balance malcolm whitehead , consultant at the menopause clinic at king 's college hospital in london , acknowledged that many women were still nervous about potential health risks of taking hrt .
and he said that despite the latest positive results , published in the british medical journal , there was still uncertainty over the health consequences of taking newer hrt combinations over the long term .
he said : " nothing in life is completely without risk - we have to explain to women that taking any type of hrt is likely to carry risks , while making them aware of the considerable benefits involved as well .
" what we need now is the pharmaceutical companies to organise long-term trials in various combinations of hrt .
" if they do n't do these studies , use of hrt is going to diminish gradually because women will be anxious about it . "
us trial the us study involved a combination of hormone which is not available in the uk , although a similar drug called premique is currently the market leader , with 300,000 users .
the trial was halted early because the researchers said there was clear evidence that the us combination was increasing the risk of heart disease , stroke and cancer - an unjustifiable risk to women .
however , mr whitehead said that the evidence was not quite clear-cut - in particular , it was possible that many of those who suffered heart problems may have had other risk factors such as high cholesterol levels or obesity .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- koizumi backs away from reform bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point business contents : e-commerce -pipe- economy -pipe- market data friday , 2 august , 2002 , 05:57 gmt 06:57 uk koizumi backs away from reform japan 's parliament session has finished on a low note , with the prime minister admitting that the country 's stubbornly moribund economy is forcing him to relax key reforms .
junichiro koizumi told a press conference to mark the end of the 192-day diet session that early tax cuts were on the agenda . "
we have to take necessary measures to avoid creating unnecessary fear " junichiro koizumi japanese prime minister " if we can secure sufficient income in future years we will be able to go ahead with tax cuts now , " he said .
but at the same time he admitted that keeping a 30 trillion yen -lrb- $ 252bn ; £ 161bn -rrb- cap on government borrowing - till now seen as essential - was going to be impossible .
and he further stirred speculation that the government 's commitment to ending full guarantees on bank deposits is being watered down .
the end of the guarantee is seen as vital to bring japan 's financial sector - groaning under immense bad loans handed out during the boom years of the 1980s - in line with international standards .
but the plan has met with widespread concern , not least from ruling party lawmakers worried about grassroots support and their own backers in the banking industry .
earlier this week mr koizumi ordered his financial services minister , hakuo yanagisawa , to look for ways of making sure smaller banks do not face a surge of savers moving their money to supposedly safer large city banks .
" we have to take necessary measures to avoid creating unnecessary fear , " he told reporters .
surprisingly , though , while the indications of weakening on the guarantees worried observers , some found the plan to remove the cap on borrowing to be a positive one .
with domestic spending firmly in the doldrums , government spending could make the difference between sustaining a fragile recovery and returning to the decade-long downturn - as long as it is not simply spent on unproductive public works programmes .
a succession of such programmes have kept the politically powerful construction industry alive , but have emptied the coffers and built the national debt to more than 600 trillion yen .
" today 's remarks by koizumi shuold be a positive message to the stock market , " said masatoshi sato of mizuho investors securities .
" but market players are likely to take a cautious stance as we still do not know how big the tax cut will be , and how the government can pay for it while the national finances are in a serious condition . "
