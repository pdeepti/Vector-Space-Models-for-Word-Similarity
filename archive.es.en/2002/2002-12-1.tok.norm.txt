this year alone , more than 5 million people have been infected with hiv – including two million women and 800,000 children under 15 years of age .
the disease killed more than 3.1 million people this year .
a social and economic catastrophe in many countries , the disease , which weakens the immune system and opens the body to opportunistic infections and other illnesses , has led to a social and economic catastrophe .
the disease is " robbing entire countries of their resources and their potential , " the united nations stated in its report .
according to unaids official michel sibide , the situation in sub-saharan africa is " out of control . "
africa is home to more than half of the world 's hiv and aids cases , with at least 29.4 million infected persons .
in zimbabwe , swaziland and lesotho , one-in-three adults is a carrier of the virus .

in europe and north america , there is a direct corollary between the decrease in aids cases during a time when hiv infection rates are actually increasing and the success of new treatment methods , including cocktail drug therapies .
but few people in developing nations have access to the treatments due to the high price of the drugs .
according to who officials , a mere 4 percent of hiv patients in developing countries have access to the life-extending drugs .

infection rates here have remained stabile and virtually unchanged from the previous year .

in its latest aids survey , the un reports dramatically increasing infection rates in former soviet states and africa and warns of barriers high drug costs present for effective global treatment . just days before the official world aids day on dec .
1 , unaids and the world health organization released the latest data on the global health crisis .
the international organizations estimate at least 42 million people around the world have become carriers of the hiv virus believed to cause aids .
at least 3.2 million of those infected are children and 19.2 percent are adult women .
a female face recent statistics have also shown that , for years now , aids has no longer been a disease concentrated among gay men .
indeed , public health experts today say the disease is quickly gaining a " female " face .
by the end of 2002 , un and who researchers predict , at least half of the world 's hiv and aids infected will be women .
this year alone , more than 5 million people have been infected with hiv – including two million women and 800,000 children under 15 years of age .
the disease killed more than 3.1 million people this year .
a social and economic catastrophe in many countries , the disease , which weakens the immune system and opens the body to opportunistic infections and other illnesses , has led to a social and economic catastrophe .
the disease is " robbing entire countries of their resources and their potential , " the united nations stated in its report .
according to unaids official michel sibide , the situation in sub-saharan africa is " out of control . "
africa is home to more than half of the world 's hiv and aids cases , with at least 29.4 million infected persons .
in zimbabwe , swaziland and lesotho , one-in-three adults is a carrier of the virus .
the people of the region are also suffering from a famine that has been triggered in large part by the inability of many of the countries ' people to work because of the illness .
explosive rate of infection in central asia unaids has also charted dramatic increases in the infection rate in eastern europe and the former soviet republics in central asia .
in uzbekistan , for example , more infections were reported during the first half of 2002 than in the previous 10 years combined .
the agency said drug abuse and the use of dirty needles are the largest causes of infection there .
" in eastern europe , the epidemic actually began in the mid- ' 90s , " dr. ulrich marcus of the robert koch institute in berlin told dw-world .
" poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovakia have hardly been touched by the disease .
the problems really began in the ukraine and the baltic states .
there was a wave of transmission through drug abuse , but now you 're starting to see subsequent transmission through sexual contacts , " he said .
disparities in treatment massive disparities in treatment from country to country also give cause for alarm .
in europe and north america , there is a direct corollary between the decrease in aids cases during a time when hiv infection rates are actually increasing and the success of new treatment methods , including cocktail drug therapies .
but few people in developing nations have access to the treatments due to the high price of the drugs .
according to who officials , a mere 4 percent of hiv patients in developing countries have access to the life-extending drugs .
infection rates stabile in germany this year , about 2,000 new hiv infections were reported in germany according to the berlin-based robert koch institute .
infection rates here have remained stabile and virtually unchanged from the previous year .

by the end of 2002 , un and who researchers predict , at least half of the world 's hiv and aids infected will be women .
this year alone , more than 5 million people have been infected with hiv – including two million women and 800,000 children under 15 years of age .
the disease killed more than 3.1 million people this year .
a social and economic catastrophe in many countries , the disease , which weakens the immune system and opens the body to opportunistic infections and other illnesses , has led to a social and economic catastrophe .
the disease is " robbing entire countries of their resources and their potential , " the united nations stated in its report .
according to unaids official michel sibide , the situation in sub-saharan africa is " out of control . "
africa is home to more than half of the world 's hiv and aids cases , with at least 29.4 million infected persons .
in zimbabwe , swaziland and lesotho , one-in-three adults is a carrier of the virus .
the people of the region are also suffering from a famine that has been triggered in large part by the inability of many of the countries ' people to work because of the illness .
explosive rate of infection in central asia unaids has also charted dramatic increases in the infection rate in eastern europe and the former soviet republics in central asia .
in uzbekistan , for example , more infections were reported during the first half of 2002 than in the previous 10 years combined .

the problems really began in the ukraine and the baltic states .
there was a wave of transmission through drug abuse , but now you 're starting to see subsequent transmission through sexual contacts , " he said .
disparities in treatment massive disparities in treatment from country to country also give cause for alarm .
in europe and north america , there is a direct corollary between the decrease in aids cases during a time when hiv infection rates are actually increasing and the success of new treatment methods , including cocktail drug therapies .
but few people in developing nations have access to the treatments due to the high price of the drugs .
according to who officials , a mere 4 percent of hiv patients in developing countries have access to the life-extending drugs .
infection rates stabile in germany this year , about 2,000 new hiv infections were reported in germany according to the berlin-based robert koch institute .
infection rates here have remained stabile and virtually unchanged from the previous year .
one third of those infected live in the country 's six biggest cities : berlin , munich , cologne , hamburg , düsseldorf and frankfurt .
in one of the few positive statistics of disparity between eastern and western germany , the institute reported that 55 percent of the infected are in western german states and only 8 percent in the states that once formed communist east germany .

in its latest aids survey , the un reports dramatically increasing infection rates in former soviet states and africa and warns of barriers high drug costs present for effective global treatment . just days before the official world aids day on dec .
1 , unaids and the world health organization released the latest data on the global health crisis .
the international organizations estimate at least 42 million people around the world have become carriers of the hiv virus believed to cause aids .
at least 3.2 million of those infected are children and 19.2 percent are adult women .
a female face recent statistics have also shown that , for years now , aids has no longer been a disease concentrated among gay men .
indeed , public health experts today say the disease is quickly gaining a " female " face .
by the end of 2002 , un and who researchers predict , at least half of the world 's hiv and aids infected will be women .
this year alone , more than 5 million people have been infected with hiv – including two million women and 800,000 children under 15 years of age .
the disease killed more than 3.1 million people this year .
a social and economic catastrophe in many countries , the disease , which weakens the immune system and opens the body to opportunistic infections and other illnesses , has led to a social and economic catastrophe .
the disease is " robbing entire countries of their resources and their potential , " the united nations stated in its report .
according to unaids official michel sibide , the situation in sub-saharan africa is " out of control . "
africa is home to more than half of the world 's hiv and aids cases , with at least 29.4 million infected persons .
in zimbabwe , swaziland and lesotho , one-in-three adults is a carrier of the virus .
the people of the region are also suffering from a famine that has been triggered in large part by the inability of many of the countries ' people to work because of the illness .
explosive rate of infection in central asia unaids has also charted dramatic increases in the infection rate in eastern europe and the former soviet republics in central asia .
in uzbekistan , for example , more infections were reported during the first half of 2002 than in the previous 10 years combined .
the agency said drug abuse and the use of dirty needles are the largest causes of infection there .
" in eastern europe , the epidemic actually began in the mid- ' 90s , " dr. ulrich marcus of the robert koch institute in berlin told dw-world .
" poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovakia have hardly been touched by the disease .
the problems really began in the ukraine and the baltic states .
there was a wave of transmission through drug abuse , but now you 're starting to see subsequent transmission through sexual contacts , " he said .
disparities in treatment massive disparities in treatment from country to country also give cause for alarm .
in europe and north america , there is a direct corollary between the decrease in aids cases during a time when hiv infection rates are actually increasing and the success of new treatment methods , including cocktail drug therapies .
but few people in developing nations have access to the treatments due to the high price of the drugs .
according to who officials , a mere 4 percent of hiv patients in developing countries have access to the life-extending drugs .
infection rates stabile in germany this year , about 2,000 new hiv infections were reported in germany according to the berlin-based robert koch institute .
infection rates here have remained stabile and virtually unchanged from the previous year .
one third of those infected live in the country 's six biggest cities : berlin , munich , cologne , hamburg , düsseldorf and frankfurt .
in one of the few positive statistics of disparity between eastern and western germany , the institute reported that 55 percent of the infected are in western german states and only 8 percent in the states that once formed communist east germany .
there are currently 39,000 hiv-infected persons living in germany , 9,000 of whom are women .
of those infected , about 5,000 have full-blown aids .

1 , unaids and the world health organization released the latest data on the global health crisis .
the international organizations estimate at least 42 million people around the world have become carriers of the hiv virus believed to cause aids .

this year alone , more than 5 million people have been infected with hiv – including two million women and 800,000 children under 15 years of age .
the disease killed more than 3.1 million people this year .
a social and economic catastrophe in many countries , the disease , which weakens the immune system and opens the body to opportunistic infections and other illnesses , has led to a social and economic catastrophe .
the disease is " robbing entire countries of their resources and their potential , " the united nations stated in its report .

africa is home to more than half of the world 's hiv and aids cases , with at least 29.4 million infected persons .
in zimbabwe , swaziland and lesotho , one-in-three adults is a carrier of the virus .
the people of the region are also suffering from a famine that has been triggered in large part by the inability of many of the countries ' people to work because of the illness .

disparities in treatment massive disparities in treatment from country to country also give cause for alarm .
in europe and north america , there is a direct corollary between the decrease in aids cases during a time when hiv infection rates are actually increasing and the success of new treatment methods , including cocktail drug therapies .
but few people in developing nations have access to the treatments due to the high price of the drugs .
according to who officials , a mere 4 percent of hiv patients in developing countries have access to the life-extending drugs .
infection rates stabile in germany this year , about 2,000 new hiv infections were reported in germany according to the berlin-based robert koch institute .
infection rates here have remained stabile and virtually unchanged from the previous year .
one third of those infected live in the country 's six biggest cities : berlin , munich , cologne , hamburg , düsseldorf and frankfurt .

there are currently 39,000 hiv-infected persons living in germany , 9,000 of whom are women .

in its latest aids survey , the un reports dramatically increasing infection rates in former soviet states and africa and warns of barriers high drug costs present for effective global treatment . just days before the official world aids day on dec .
1 , unaids and the world health organization released the latest data on the global health crisis .
the international organizations estimate at least 42 million people around the world have become carriers of the hiv virus believed to cause aids .
at least 3.2 million of those infected are children and 19.2 percent are adult women .
a female face recent statistics have also shown that , for years now , aids has no longer been a disease concentrated among gay men .
indeed , public health experts today say the disease is quickly gaining a " female " face .
by the end of 2002 , un and who researchers predict , at least half of the world 's hiv and aids infected will be women .
this year alone , more than 5 million people have been infected with hiv – including two million women and 800,000 children under 15 years of age .
the disease killed more than 3.1 million people this year .
a social and economic catastrophe in many countries , the disease , which weakens the immune system and opens the body to opportunistic infections and other illnesses , has led to a social and economic catastrophe .
the disease is " robbing entire countries of their resources and their potential , " the united nations stated in its report .
according to unaids official michel sibide , the situation in sub-saharan africa is " out of control . "
africa is home to more than half of the world 's hiv and aids cases , with at least 29.4 million infected persons .
in zimbabwe , swaziland and lesotho , one-in-three adults is a carrier of the virus .
the people of the region are also suffering from a famine that has been triggered in large part by the inability of many of the countries ' people to work because of the illness .
explosive rate of infection in central asia unaids has also charted dramatic increases in the infection rate in eastern europe and the former soviet republics in central asia .
in uzbekistan , for example , more infections were reported during the first half of 2002 than in the previous 10 years combined .
the agency said drug abuse and the use of dirty needles are the largest causes of infection there .
" in eastern europe , the epidemic actually began in the mid- ' 90s , " dr. ulrich marcus of the robert koch institute in berlin told dw-world .
" poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovakia have hardly been touched by the disease .
the problems really began in the ukraine and the baltic states .
there was a wave of transmission through drug abuse , but now you 're starting to see subsequent transmission through sexual contacts , " he said .
disparities in treatment massive disparities in treatment from country to country also give cause for alarm .
in europe and north america , there is a direct corollary between the decrease in aids cases during a time when hiv infection rates are actually increasing and the success of new treatment methods , including cocktail drug therapies .
but few people in developing nations have access to the treatments due to the high price of the drugs .
according to who officials , a mere 4 percent of hiv patients in developing countries have access to the life-extending drugs .
infection rates stabile in germany this year , about 2,000 new hiv infections were reported in germany according to the berlin-based robert koch institute .
infection rates here have remained stabile and virtually unchanged from the previous year .
one third of those infected live in the country 's six biggest cities : berlin , munich , cologne , hamburg , düsseldorf and frankfurt .
