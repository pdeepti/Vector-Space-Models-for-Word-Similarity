program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2002 germans still think green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental problems can not just be ironed away despite pressing problems such as unemployment and a stagnant economy , the majority of germans are still concerned about environmental issues and award it a high priority according to the results of a new study . the recent catastrophic floods in germany sparked a heated debate in the country on climate-change and the need to rethink environmentally-friendly policies .
but even as many people fear that the environment will be a short-lived topic in public memory and overshadowed by more pressing issues such as unemployment and economic growth , the results of the study " environmental consciousness in germany 2002 " show otherwise .
the study commissioned by the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- and conducted by social scientist udo kuckartz and the emnid institute questioned 2,361 men and women from all over germany in january this year on their attitudes towards the environment .
environment still a priority though most considered spiralling unemployment to be the most important issue in the coming elections , environmental protection came in fourth place after " social fairness " and " state of the economy " .
it was even given more priority than " internal security " , which dominated public debate in germany after the september 11 attacks in new york .
almost 93 percent of those surveyed considered environment protection to be " important " .
my backyard 's cleaner the study concluded that most germans consider the biggest environmental problems to be elsewhere in the world , not in their own country .
83 percent of those surveyed said that they found the environmental quality in germany extremely good - a typical pattern that is to be found in all countries in the world , according to social scientist udo kuckartz .
he told the " berliner zeitung " , " as compared to news of catastrophes from elsewhere , everything seems to be better in one ’ s own backyard to start with " .
along those lines , most showed less concern for noise pollution in germany than for global problems such as global warming .
about 94 percent were in favour of reducing greenhouse emissions , 77 percent believed that the atmosphere would become warmer .
climate change : more needs to be done echoing recent concerns in the aftermath of the devastating floods , climate change was considered one of the important issues by almost all questioned .
most also believed that very little progress had been made on the topic , despite its significance .
60 percent were of the opinion that hardly anything of importance had been achieved in the field in the last five years , for 25 percent the situation had become " even worse " .
half of those surveyed were in favour of germany taking a leading role on the subject of climate change rather than waiting for a european solution .
thinking green does n't mean voting for green the researchers also discovered that environmental concerns didn ’ t necessarily stem from one ’ s political conviction .
those who were interested and concerned about environmental problems don ’ t automatically vote for the green party .
researchers filtered out those who were particularly dedicated to environmental matters from all those surveyed on the basis of whether they belonged to an environmental organisation .
among them almost every fifth person identified with the green party , whereas every fourth was in favour of the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in former communist eastern germany , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the former communist party , was the most popular among environmentally-involved citizens .
the study also concluded that there is a marked shift in germany today from the fiery environmental movement that peaked in the 1970s with the emergence of the green party where anti-nuclear protests , conservation movements and hostility towards modern technology made for headlines around the world .
according to the study , germans are much more pragmatic and sober about environmental issues today and environmental consciousness is no longer equated with hostility towards technology .
instead technology is largely seen as a useful instrument in saving the environment .
topics at jo ’ burg summit find resonance with german public the word " sustainability " , the magic mantra at the ongoing earth summit in johannesburg , threw many questioned off track .
just about 28 percent said they knew what the word meant , though the figure is almost twice as high as when a similar study was conducted two years ago .
" when one considers that in the meantime almost everybody from environmental experts to business experts tout the word , it -lrb- the percentage of people who know the word -rrb- is still very low " , kuckartz told the " berliner zeitung " .
at the same time , an overwhelming number agreed with the principles behind the rather unwieldy word " sustainability " or " nachhaltigkeit " as it is known in german .
thus 85 percent of the germans agreed that the environment should not be exploited at the cost of future generations , 78 percent considered it important that one should not use more resources than can be grown . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de environment matters dw-world world summit 2002 dossier www-links the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- 02 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but even as many people fear that the environment will be a short-lived topic in public memory and overshadowed by more pressing issues such as unemployment and economic growth , the results of the study " environmental consciousness in germany 2002 " show otherwise .
the study commissioned by the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- and conducted by social scientist udo kuckartz and the emnid institute questioned 2,361 men and women from all over germany in january this year on their attitudes towards the environment .
environment still a priority though most considered spiralling unemployment to be the most important issue in the coming elections , environmental protection came in fourth place after " social fairness " and " state of the economy " .
it was even given more priority than " internal security " , which dominated public debate in germany after the september 11 attacks in new york .
almost 93 percent of those surveyed considered environment protection to be " important " .
my backyard 's cleaner the study concluded that most germans consider the biggest environmental problems to be elsewhere in the world , not in their own country .
83 percent of those surveyed said that they found the environmental quality in germany extremely good - a typical pattern that is to be found in all countries in the world , according to social scientist udo kuckartz .
he told the " berliner zeitung " , " as compared to news of catastrophes from elsewhere , everything seems to be better in one ’ s own backyard to start with " .
along those lines , most showed less concern for noise pollution in germany than for global problems such as global warming .
about 94 percent were in favour of reducing greenhouse emissions , 77 percent believed that the atmosphere would become warmer .
climate change : more needs to be done echoing recent concerns in the aftermath of the devastating floods , climate change was considered one of the important issues by almost all questioned .
most also believed that very little progress had been made on the topic , despite its significance .
60 percent were of the opinion that hardly anything of importance had been achieved in the field in the last five years , for 25 percent the situation had become " even worse " .
half of those surveyed were in favour of germany taking a leading role on the subject of climate change rather than waiting for a european solution .
thinking green does n't mean voting for green the researchers also discovered that environmental concerns didn ’ t necessarily stem from one ’ s political conviction .
those who were interested and concerned about environmental problems don ’ t automatically vote for the green party .
researchers filtered out those who were particularly dedicated to environmental matters from all those surveyed on the basis of whether they belonged to an environmental organisation .
among them almost every fifth person identified with the green party , whereas every fourth was in favour of the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in former communist eastern germany , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the former communist party , was the most popular among environmentally-involved citizens .
the study also concluded that there is a marked shift in germany today from the fiery environmental movement that peaked in the 1970s with the emergence of the green party where anti-nuclear protests , conservation movements and hostility towards modern technology made for headlines around the world .
according to the study , germans are much more pragmatic and sober about environmental issues today and environmental consciousness is no longer equated with hostility towards technology .
instead technology is largely seen as a useful instrument in saving the environment .
topics at jo ’ burg summit find resonance with german public the word " sustainability " , the magic mantra at the ongoing earth summit in johannesburg , threw many questioned off track .
just about 28 percent said they knew what the word meant , though the figure is almost twice as high as when a similar study was conducted two years ago .
" when one considers that in the meantime almost everybody from environmental experts to business experts tout the word , it -lrb- the percentage of people who know the word -rrb- is still very low " , kuckartz told the " berliner zeitung " .
at the same time , an overwhelming number agreed with the principles behind the rather unwieldy word " sustainability " or " nachhaltigkeit " as it is known in german .
thus 85 percent of the germans agreed that the environment should not be exploited at the cost of future generations , 78 percent considered it important that one should not use more resources than can be grown . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de environment matters dw-world world summit 2002 dossier www-links the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2002 germans still think green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental problems can not just be ironed away despite pressing problems such as unemployment and a stagnant economy , the majority of germans are still concerned about environmental issues and award it a high priority according to the results of a new study . the recent catastrophic floods in germany sparked a heated debate in the country on climate-change and the need to rethink environmentally-friendly policies .
but even as many people fear that the environment will be a short-lived topic in public memory and overshadowed by more pressing issues such as unemployment and economic growth , the results of the study " environmental consciousness in germany 2002 " show otherwise .
the study commissioned by the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- and conducted by social scientist udo kuckartz and the emnid institute questioned 2,361 men and women from all over germany in january this year on their attitudes towards the environment .
environment still a priority though most considered spiralling unemployment to be the most important issue in the coming elections , environmental protection came in fourth place after " social fairness " and " state of the economy " .
it was even given more priority than " internal security " , which dominated public debate in germany after the september 11 attacks in new york .
almost 93 percent of those surveyed considered environment protection to be " important " .
my backyard 's cleaner the study concluded that most germans consider the biggest environmental problems to be elsewhere in the world , not in their own country .
83 percent of those surveyed said that they found the environmental quality in germany extremely good - a typical pattern that is to be found in all countries in the world , according to social scientist udo kuckartz .
he told the " berliner zeitung " , " as compared to news of catastrophes from elsewhere , everything seems to be better in one ’ s own backyard to start with " .
along those lines , most showed less concern for noise pollution in germany than for global problems such as global warming .
about 94 percent were in favour of reducing greenhouse emissions , 77 percent believed that the atmosphere would become warmer .
climate change : more needs to be done echoing recent concerns in the aftermath of the devastating floods , climate change was considered one of the important issues by almost all questioned .
most also believed that very little progress had been made on the topic , despite its significance .
60 percent were of the opinion that hardly anything of importance had been achieved in the field in the last five years , for 25 percent the situation had become " even worse " .
half of those surveyed were in favour of germany taking a leading role on the subject of climate change rather than waiting for a european solution .
thinking green does n't mean voting for green the researchers also discovered that environmental concerns didn ’ t necessarily stem from one ’ s political conviction .
those who were interested and concerned about environmental problems don ’ t automatically vote for the green party .
researchers filtered out those who were particularly dedicated to environmental matters from all those surveyed on the basis of whether they belonged to an environmental organisation .
among them almost every fifth person identified with the green party , whereas every fourth was in favour of the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in former communist eastern germany , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the former communist party , was the most popular among environmentally-involved citizens .
the study also concluded that there is a marked shift in germany today from the fiery environmental movement that peaked in the 1970s with the emergence of the green party where anti-nuclear protests , conservation movements and hostility towards modern technology made for headlines around the world .
according to the study , germans are much more pragmatic and sober about environmental issues today and environmental consciousness is no longer equated with hostility towards technology .
instead technology is largely seen as a useful instrument in saving the environment .
topics at jo ’ burg summit find resonance with german public the word " sustainability " , the magic mantra at the ongoing earth summit in johannesburg , threw many questioned off track .
just about 28 percent said they knew what the word meant , though the figure is almost twice as high as when a similar study was conducted two years ago .
" when one considers that in the meantime almost everybody from environmental experts to business experts tout the word , it -lrb- the percentage of people who know the word -rrb- is still very low " , kuckartz told the " berliner zeitung " .
at the same time , an overwhelming number agreed with the principles behind the rather unwieldy word " sustainability " or " nachhaltigkeit " as it is known in german .

but even as many people fear that the environment will be a short-lived topic in public memory and overshadowed by more pressing issues such as unemployment and economic growth , the results of the study " environmental consciousness in germany 2002 " show otherwise .
the study commissioned by the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- and conducted by social scientist udo kuckartz and the emnid institute questioned 2,361 men and women from all over germany in january this year on their attitudes towards the environment .
environment still a priority though most considered spiralling unemployment to be the most important issue in the coming elections , environmental protection came in fourth place after " social fairness " and " state of the economy " .
it was even given more priority than " internal security " , which dominated public debate in germany after the september 11 attacks in new york .
almost 93 percent of those surveyed considered environment protection to be " important " .
my backyard 's cleaner the study concluded that most germans consider the biggest environmental problems to be elsewhere in the world , not in their own country .
83 percent of those surveyed said that they found the environmental quality in germany extremely good - a typical pattern that is to be found in all countries in the world , according to social scientist udo kuckartz .
he told the " berliner zeitung " , " as compared to news of catastrophes from elsewhere , everything seems to be better in one ’ s own backyard to start with " .
along those lines , most showed less concern for noise pollution in germany than for global problems such as global warming .
about 94 percent were in favour of reducing greenhouse emissions , 77 percent believed that the atmosphere would become warmer .
climate change : more needs to be done echoing recent concerns in the aftermath of the devastating floods , climate change was considered one of the important issues by almost all questioned .
most also believed that very little progress had been made on the topic , despite its significance .
60 percent were of the opinion that hardly anything of importance had been achieved in the field in the last five years , for 25 percent the situation had become " even worse " .
half of those surveyed were in favour of germany taking a leading role on the subject of climate change rather than waiting for a european solution .
thinking green does n't mean voting for green the researchers also discovered that environmental concerns didn ’ t necessarily stem from one ’ s political conviction .
those who were interested and concerned about environmental problems don ’ t automatically vote for the green party .
researchers filtered out those who were particularly dedicated to environmental matters from all those surveyed on the basis of whether they belonged to an environmental organisation .
among them almost every fifth person identified with the green party , whereas every fourth was in favour of the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in former communist eastern germany , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the former communist party , was the most popular among environmentally-involved citizens .
the study also concluded that there is a marked shift in germany today from the fiery environmental movement that peaked in the 1970s with the emergence of the green party where anti-nuclear protests , conservation movements and hostility towards modern technology made for headlines around the world .
according to the study , germans are much more pragmatic and sober about environmental issues today and environmental consciousness is no longer equated with hostility towards technology .
instead technology is largely seen as a useful instrument in saving the environment .

but even as many people fear that the environment will be a short-lived topic in public memory and overshadowed by more pressing issues such as unemployment and economic growth , the results of the study " environmental consciousness in germany 2002 " show otherwise .
the study commissioned by the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- and conducted by social scientist udo kuckartz and the emnid institute questioned 2,361 men and women from all over germany in january this year on their attitudes towards the environment .
environment still a priority though most considered spiralling unemployment to be the most important issue in the coming elections , environmental protection came in fourth place after " social fairness " and " state of the economy " .
it was even given more priority than " internal security " , which dominated public debate in germany after the september 11 attacks in new york .
almost 93 percent of those surveyed considered environment protection to be " important " .
my backyard 's cleaner the study concluded that most germans consider the biggest environmental problems to be elsewhere in the world , not in their own country .
83 percent of those surveyed said that they found the environmental quality in germany extremely good - a typical pattern that is to be found in all countries in the world , according to social scientist udo kuckartz .
he told the " berliner zeitung " , " as compared to news of catastrophes from elsewhere , everything seems to be better in one ’ s own backyard to start with " .
along those lines , most showed less concern for noise pollution in germany than for global problems such as global warming .
about 94 percent were in favour of reducing greenhouse emissions , 77 percent believed that the atmosphere would become warmer .
climate change : more needs to be done echoing recent concerns in the aftermath of the devastating floods , climate change was considered one of the important issues by almost all questioned .
most also believed that very little progress had been made on the topic , despite its significance .
60 percent were of the opinion that hardly anything of importance had been achieved in the field in the last five years , for 25 percent the situation had become " even worse " .
half of those surveyed were in favour of germany taking a leading role on the subject of climate change rather than waiting for a european solution .
thinking green does n't mean voting for green the researchers also discovered that environmental concerns didn ’ t necessarily stem from one ’ s political conviction .
those who were interested and concerned about environmental problems don ’ t automatically vote for the green party .

but even as many people fear that the environment will be a short-lived topic in public memory and overshadowed by more pressing issues such as unemployment and economic growth , the results of the study " environmental consciousness in germany 2002 " show otherwise .
the study commissioned by the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- and conducted by social scientist udo kuckartz and the emnid institute questioned 2,361 men and women from all over germany in january this year on their attitudes towards the environment .
environment still a priority though most considered spiralling unemployment to be the most important issue in the coming elections , environmental protection came in fourth place after " social fairness " and " state of the economy " .
it was even given more priority than " internal security " , which dominated public debate in germany after the september 11 attacks in new york .
almost 93 percent of those surveyed considered environment protection to be " important " .
my backyard 's cleaner the study concluded that most germans consider the biggest environmental problems to be elsewhere in the world , not in their own country .
83 percent of those surveyed said that they found the environmental quality in germany extremely good - a typical pattern that is to be found in all countries in the world , according to social scientist udo kuckartz .
he told the " berliner zeitung " , " as compared to news of catastrophes from elsewhere , everything seems to be better in one ’ s own backyard to start with " .
along those lines , most showed less concern for noise pollution in germany than for global problems such as global warming .
about 94 percent were in favour of reducing greenhouse emissions , 77 percent believed that the atmosphere would become warmer .
climate change : more needs to be done echoing recent concerns in the aftermath of the devastating floods , climate change was considered one of the important issues by almost all questioned .
most also believed that very little progress had been made on the topic , despite its significance .
60 percent were of the opinion that hardly anything of importance had been achieved in the field in the last five years , for 25 percent the situation had become " even worse " .
half of those surveyed were in favour of germany taking a leading role on the subject of climate change rather than waiting for a european solution .

60 percent were of the opinion that hardly anything of importance had been achieved in the field in the last five years , for 25 percent the situation had become " even worse " .
half of those surveyed were in favour of germany taking a leading role on the subject of climate change rather than waiting for a european solution .
thinking green does n't mean voting for green the researchers also discovered that environmental concerns didn ’ t necessarily stem from one ’ s political conviction .

researchers filtered out those who were particularly dedicated to environmental matters from all those surveyed on the basis of whether they belonged to an environmental organisation .
among them almost every fifth person identified with the green party , whereas every fourth was in favour of the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in former communist eastern germany , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the former communist party , was the most popular among environmentally-involved citizens .
the study also concluded that there is a marked shift in germany today from the fiery environmental movement that peaked in the 1970s with the emergence of the green party where anti-nuclear protests , conservation movements and hostility towards modern technology made for headlines around the world .
according to the study , germans are much more pragmatic and sober about environmental issues today and environmental consciousness is no longer equated with hostility towards technology .
instead technology is largely seen as a useful instrument in saving the environment .
topics at jo ’ burg summit find resonance with german public the word " sustainability " , the magic mantra at the ongoing earth summit in johannesburg , threw many questioned off track .

at the same time , an overwhelming number agreed with the principles behind the rather unwieldy word " sustainability " or " nachhaltigkeit " as it is known in german .

the trio , from edinburgh university , put forward proposals for assessing how bacteria cope in zero gravity conditions on board the foton-m1 satellite .
their experiment will be taken on board the craft when it is launched in october near plesetsk in russia .
the three undergraduates , all aged 21 , submitted one of three winning group entries in the contest , organised by the european and russian space agencies .
the students were group winners rishi dhir , from leeds , darren smillie , from hull and tamara banerjee , from hertfordshire , study medicine and physics .
mr dhir said the experiment could help scientists to work out how bacteria might establish communities on other planets which have reduced gravity .
he hoped it would also help in understanding how bacterial infections might be transmitted during manned space flights .
he said : " we started work on the project about a year ago .
agency visit " because two of us are medical students , we wanted to do something with a medical application , so the experiment will examine how bacterial communities develop in a zero gravity environment . "
entries for the competition had to weigh no more than 2.5kg and be able to withstand being launched into space .
the students will travel to the european space agency headquarters in the netherlands ahead of the 15 october launch , which they hope to attend .
the russian satellite will be in orbit for two to three weeks .
other students from the university of york and the swiss federal institute of technology in zurich were successful in the competition .

we are very , very close to deciding whether we buy airbus or boeing sir richard branson the australia-based airline , which has applied for permission to fly to hong kong two years after launching as a domestic airline , is investigating further international expansion , sir richard said .
the carrier is also pursuing plans to start flights to new zealand , with the tropical resort island of bali a likely future destination .
" bali 's one of my favourite places .
i 'm sure we 'll be applying to fly to bali at some stage , " he said .
the airline is also poised to order extra aircraft , and attempt to build on the 20 % share of australia 's domestic passenger market .
" we are very , very close to deciding whether we buy airbus or boeing and we 'll be committing to about 40 planes , so it 's a big order , " sir richard said .
listing plans the expansion would boost sentiment over the airline 's prospects at a time when it is being prepared for stock market flotation .
sir richard on friday signalled that flotation was likely in 2003 .
while other parts of his virgin empire have in the past been seen as more likely flotation targets , virgin blue 's success has placed it in pole position to open a process which observers say could see eight of sir richard 's firms gain a market listing by 2010 .
a listing for virgin mobile , the uk 's fifth ranking mobile phone firm , was " not for the immediate future " , sir richard said .
he launched his virgin group onto the market in the 1980s but difficult relations with the city prompted him to buy back the firm two years later .

sir richard also restated his confidence in the future of virgin atlantic airways , back in the black after a torrid period following the 11 september attacks .
" we are back in profit for virgin atlantic and the capacity has come back very well , i think we 're back in the high 70 % to low 80 % now , " he said .

every now and then reality just refuses to be kept at bay .
today was one of those days .
i 've spent most of the last week cooped up in the richest square mile in africa , mixing with well-intentioned people -lrb- most of them -rrb- doing their best to make the poor less poor .
some -lsb- aids sufferers -rsb- ... live out their remaining days on abandoned mine dumps , away from human contact it 's anyone 's guess whether they 'll be able to make much difference .
today , though , i went to the world 's biggest hospital , on the edge of soweto , to see an environmental improvement scheme .
on the way back to central jozi , the people who 'd taken me to soweto suggested we stop briefly at a hospice for hiv-aids sufferers .
i did n't know what to expect - horror , squalor , resignation , despair .
i did n't find any of those .
what i did find was life .
saving the ' sparrows ' the sparrow ministries project , as its name suggests , is a christian enterprise .
for years it struggled .
now it has a proper settlement of simple round brick huts .
the hospices try to provide sufferers with a little dignity it provides in-patient care to 35 adults and 48 children and other community-based services as well .
it has grand plans for expansion .
we went to the children 's part of the rainbow village .
children swarmed like bees as we entered , entwining themselves about us , wanting to be picked up , played with or just held .
we saw one six-year-old playing happily with a hoop .
he was the size of a british child of two .
in this part of gauteng province , 42 % of the miners are known to be hiv-positive .
brief lives how many other adults are affected nobody knows .
some of those who have succumbed go to live out their remaining days on abandoned mine dumps , away from human contact .
some of the children are brought ... by the police , who find them when they collect their parents ' bodies from the city streets others are found by animal welfare workers as they search for injured or neglected animals on rubbish dumps and in scrapyards .
some of the children are brought to sparrow 's nest by the police , who find them when they collect their parents ' bodies from the city streets .
it 's rare for any of them to survive much beyond the age of 10 .
most of them were bubbling with laughter but i was struck by one little boy who refused to respond at all apart from placing his cold hand in mine .
when we left , though , he waved goodbye .
good intentions we watched a brief video about the work of the hospice .
one woman shown in it was gaunt and looked worn out .
she died this morning .
it would be cheap to say that those who end their days in sparrow 's nest are there because of the policies of the captains and the kings assembled at the summit a few miles away .
i hope , for all that , the summit can make places like the hospice unnecessary .
i 've spent most of the week doubting the delegates ' ability to achieve very much .

every now and then reality just refuses to be kept at bay .
today was one of those days .
i 've spent most of the last week cooped up in the richest square mile in africa , mixing with well-intentioned people -lrb- most of them -rrb- doing their best to make the poor less poor . "
some -lsb- aids sufferers -rsb- ... live out their remaining days on abandoned mine dumps , away from human contact " it 's anyone 's guess whether they 'll be able to make much difference .
today , though , i went to the world 's biggest hospital , on the edge of soweto , to see an environmental improvement scheme .
on the way back to central jozi , the people who 'd taken me to soweto suggested we stop briefly at a hospice for hiv-aids sufferers .
i did n't know what to expect - horror , squalor , resignation , despair .
i did n't find any of those .
what i did find was life .
saving the ' sparrows ' the sparrow ministries project , as its name suggests , is a christian enterprise .
for years it struggled .
now it has a proper settlement of simple round brick huts .
it provides in-patient care to 35 adults and 48 children and other community-based services as well .
it has grand plans for expansion .
we went to the children 's part of the rainbow village .
children swarmed like bees as we entered , entwining themselves about us , wanting to be picked up , played with or just held .
we saw one six-year-old playing happily with a hoop .
he was the size of a british child of two .
in this part of gauteng province , 42 % of the miners are known to be hiv-positive .
brief lives how many other adults are affected nobody knows .
some of those who have succumbed go to live out their remaining days on abandoned mine dumps , away from human contact . "
some of the children are brought ... by the police , who find them when they collect their parents ' bodies from the city streets " others are found by animal welfare workers as they search for injured or neglected animals on rubbish dumps and in scrapyards .
some of the children are brought to sparrow 's nest by the police , who find them when they collect their parents ' bodies from the city streets .
it 's rare for any of them to survive much beyond the age of 10 .
most of them were bubbling with laughter but i was struck by one little boy who refused to respond at all apart from placing his cold hand in mine .
when we left , though , he waved goodbye .
good intentions we watched a brief video about the work of the hospice .
one woman shown in it was gaunt and looked worn out .
she died this morning .
it would be cheap to say that those who end their days in sparrow 's nest are there because of the policies of the captains and the kings assembled at the summit a few miles away .
i hope , for all that , the summit can make places like the hospice unnecessary .
i 've spent most of the week doubting the delegates ' ability to achieve very much .
today , i really would love to be proved wrong .

specialist nurses from the network , trained in advising on medication , will be responsible for recruiting patients for the trials .
across wales , around 1,000 cancer patients are already taking part in clinical trials .
bill baldock from blaenavon has been helping with drugs trials and said he would recommend other patients to do the same .
" i would advise anyone in my situation to go on trials , because you get first-class treatment and you 're regularly monitored , " he said .
but with up to 15,000 new cases of cancer diagnosed each year , specialists in wales are hoping to be able to offer one in 10 patients the chance to take part by 2005 .
the network started with four nurses four years ago who were based in bangor , cardiff , rhyl and swansea .
since then , the number of patients participating in trials has trebled .
wctn director professor tim maughan said increasing participation by an extra 10 % would be a major achievement .
" this figure would represent the highest recruitment levels for adult cancer patients in the uk , putting wales at the top of the league .
" this new phase for wctn is good news for cancer patients today and in the future .
" it will help us reach more people , particularly in rural areas . "
health minister jane hutt described excellence in research was a " vital element " in ensuring the best treatment for welsh patients .
cancer research uk cymru chief executive sir paul nurse said finding the move would speed up the process of finding new treatments .
" cancer patients who are within a clinical trial tend to do better than patients with a similar stage and type of cancer who are not involve in a cancer trial , " he added .

it 's fantasy to think that you would get regulatory approval in the us to combine 43 % with 12 % " peter brabeck nestle nestle chief executive peter brabeck dismissed as " fantasy " the idea that us anti-trust regulators would wave through a takeover of hershey , the wall street journal europe newspaper said .
the comment follows growing legal challenges in the us to any takeover of hershey , one of the country 's most famous firms , and owner of brands including reese 's peanut butter cups and hershey 's kisses .
however , observers will question whether nestle is attempting to play down its purchase plans in an effort to deflect attention towards rival bidders , thought likely to include us-owned kraft and uk-based cadbury schweppes .
mega merger with top-ranking hershey boasting 43 % of the us chocolate market , and third-placed nestle claiming 12 % , mr brabeck said he could not believe that the federal trade commission would back the deal .
" can you imagine the ftc saying ' congratulations , beautiful ' ? "
mr brabeck was quoted as saying .
" it 's fantasy to think that you would get regulatory approval in the us to combine 43 % with 12 % . "
nestle has been seen as front runner to win the battle to take over hershey , which is expected to fetch up to $ 12bn .
legal hurdles hershey 's future has come under increasing scrutiny since the hershey trust , a charitable foundation which controls 77 % of voting shares in the firm , revealed plans to sell its stake in a bid to diversify its investment portfolio .
but pennsylvania 's attorney general , mike fisher , last week opened a legal battle to block the sale , claiming it would cause " irreparable damage " to the town of hershey .
and an association for orphan ex-pupils of a school run by the trust , and set up by the firm 's founder milton hershey , on thursday filed a separate petition .
the petition seeks to have the alumni association appointed as the representative of the school 's pupils , who are the hershey trust 's sole beneficiaries .
" you ca n't have these proceedings hurtling forward without somebody speaking for the children , and right now nobody does , " association president ric fouad said .
trust spokesman rick kelley said : " this filing is completely predictable , given the behaviour of the alumni association over the last dozen years .

we would expect to prevail in court . "

the paper is referring to the results of its survey of labour constituency chairmen in the party 's 100 most marginal seats .
of the 70 chairmen prepared to share their views , only five said unequivocally that they would support military action while 60 expressed strong opposition .
the chairman of the watford labour party , mike jackson , said he considered himself to be a party loyalist , but he explained that he opposed a war and - along with other members - intended to use the party conference as a mechanism to let his views be known .
the guardian also cites problems for tony blair , claiming there are fears in downing street about the prime minister 's ability to exert any influence at all on america 's policy towards saddam hussein .
speeches by the us vice-president , dick cheney , and america 's defence secretary , donald rumsfeld , have left mr blair looking foolish , according to the paper .
prescott queries it argues that while mr blair tries to formulate an effective policy on iraq , he must realise that when he holds a scheduled news conference next week he will have to say more than " wait and see " .
the sun seems more sure of the prime minister 's stance on iraq .
it tells its readers that mr blair is convinced that britain and the united states should press the united nations for permission to launch military strikes .
the daily mirror concerns itself with the deputy prime minister , john prescott , asking " what is he up to ? "
it remarks that " a blanket of secrecy " has been thrown over mr prescott 's meetings at the world development summit in johannesburg .
the independent reassures us that mr prescott is taking the talks seriously - it carries a picture of him on its front page along with his statement that if the summit failed it would be " tragic for the whole world " .
' gridlocked britain ' but those comments fail to convince the daily telegraph , which asks mr prescott : " where are you when we need you ? "
the paper remarks that it is a pity he is busy saving the world when he is needed at home to deal with transport problems .
the telegraph is referring to news that road traffic has increased and 40 miles of the west coast railway line is to be taken out of use for four months to allow an extensive upgrade of the route to be completed .

tributes his family have given their version of events after receiving information from another officer serving with the unit in afghanistan .

he was a keen rugby player and played at the top level in the army .
he also joined a commando group three years ago .
" everyone who knew bob is utterly devastated .
bob loved the army , it was his whole life , " said the family in a statement .

the agreement , which followed two days of economic talks in seoul , is the latest sign that the secretive north is determined to end its diplomatic isolation .
korean deal restore one road and rail link this year complete second links next year military talks on border safety study joint flood defences south to give north 400,000 tonnes of rice , 100,000 tonnes of fertiliser the north has also agreed to receive japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi for an historic visit in september .
the two countries have no diplomatic relations and no japanese prime minister has ever visited .
mr koizumi was due to spend one day in the north on 17 september and hold talks with its leader kim jong-il .
" i want to discuss directly with him the possibility of restarting efforts to normalize our relations , " mr koizumi said .
japan and south korea 's eagerness to engage with north korea appeared to sit at odds with american wariness towards the communist state .
on thursday , a senior us diplomat warned that north korea was the world 's leading exporter of ballistic missile technology and repeated president george w bush 's assertion that it forms part of an " axis of evil " .
mr koizumi said he had discussed the visit with both us president george w bush and south korean president kim dae-jung .
a japanese official said the visit had been under discussion for more than a year .
north-south progress according to the south korean version of a joint statement issued on friday , both sides had agreed to reconnect one railway line by the end of this year and construct a second by early next year .
importantly , the two sides ' militaries will hold talks before work begins on 18 september .
the 4-kilometer-wide -lrb- 2.5-mile-wide -rrb- demilitarized zone is heavily mined .
military co-operation is seen as a pre-requisite for the transport links , which have been cut since the end of the 1950-53 korean war , to be restored safely .
south korea said it had agreed to send 400,000 tonnes and 100,000 tonnes of fertiliser to north korea on credit as soon as possible .
the north 's command economy has been unable to feed its people for several years and there have been widespread reports of famine .
mr koizumi 's proposed visit to north korea was apparently raised at talks in pyongyang this week between japanese and north korean officials .
japan and north korea relations are often tense , especially over japanese allegations that some of its nationals were kidnapped to train north korean spies .
