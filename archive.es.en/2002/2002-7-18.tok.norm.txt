with evening events and espresso bars , sitting areas and cd lounges , germany ’ s modern super-bookstores are driving out smaller independent shops in the ever more competitive book market . for some time now , independent bookstores in germany have been going through a series of structural changes .
competition from mega bookstore chains the size of department stores has been driving out smaller mom and pop shops from their traditional urban basis .
the small local shops , with their customer-oriented service and individual approach to selling books , simply can not compete with the larger mass-market chains , and a good number of them have been forced to close .
many of these small shops have suffered significant financial losses , though these are mostly attributed to the general slump in book sales in germany .
compared to the last 25 years when sales figures remained fairly stagnate , the first five months of 2002 recorded a 2.1 percent decline in sales .
hard times for small booksellers the drop in book sales has affected the entire branch .
the traditional berlin-based kiepert , a local bookstore with several shops throughout the city , was only able to pay 70 percent of employee wages in may , and in june close to a third of its 170 employees were laid off .
in july , the industry journal " buchmarkt " reported that the kiepert family had requested distributors to temporarily forgive up to 60 percent of the bookstore ’ s debts .
if the situation doesn ’ t improve soon , the company says it will have to close some of its branches .
in the last year alone , 30 of berlin ’ s 330 bookstores were forced to close their doors after suffering heavy financial losses .
this year , 11 have closed shop , including some of the city ’ s longest-operating booksellers .
but berlin is not alone .
throughout germany bookstores are struggling to survive in the face of a major downturn in consumer spending .
the cologne-based alibi , an independent bookstore specializing in detective novels , was hit so hard by the sales slump that it was forced to vacate its street-front property and move into the basement of another independent bookseller .
but its sales have plummeted even further now that the store is no longer so visible , and it ’ s only a question of time before the small business closes altogether .
big book businesses struggling too declining sales are not only a problem for independent booksellers .
the large nation-wide chains have been struck equally as hard .
germany ’ s second largest bookstore , hugendubel , which has 1,100 employees at 28 stores , has announced it will cut employee hours to make up for the loss of this year ’ s profits .
dieter schormann , chairman of the association of german publishers and booksellers in germany , has expressed concern about the current situation .
" at this point , we have no idea when the situation will improve .
that makes it very depressing , " he told the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " when the dwindling sales figures came out .
but detlef bluhm , manager of the berlin association of publishers and booksellers , says " the average sales figures don ’ t tell the whole story . "
the market has more ups and downs .
" some businesses are suffering two figure losses whereas others are growing , " he says pointing to the country ’ s top bookseller thalia which has increased sales by 0.8 percent .
too much competition bad for some ?
the inconsistency in market sales has led to an extremely competitive business landscape in germany .
from small to big and independent to franchise , bookstores are fighting for the consumer ’ s remaining euros .
" it used to be that there was an unspoken rule in the industry not to open a new book store a 100 meters away from an existing one , " says christine böse , assistant store manager for bouvier , a regional book chain based in bonn .
" today , that ’ s no longer the case .
bookstores are expanding much more aggressively , " she says .
and each time a new store opens , it detracts business from older ones .
this is particularly true when the new store on the block is a big chain .
in the last few years , the country ’ s biggest bookstores have continued to expand while the number of smaller ones has shrunk .
krefeld , a mid-size western german city in north rhine-westphalia , is a good example of this trend .
when two of germany ’ s biggest chains moved in , seven of the city ’ s traditional independent stores shut down .
they couldn ’ t compete with the bigger , more modern stores .
in berlin , at the same time the 30 independent booksellers folded , big chains with over 30,000 square meters of sales space -lrb- 322,900 square feet -rrb- expanded their presence in the city .
and the mega-bookstores aren ’ t done taking over germany ’ s capital .
thomas nitz , manager of hugendubel , says the city ’ s book demand is not quite " satiated " .
there ’ s still room for growth , he told " buchreport " .
a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .
the bigger the store , the bigger the price reductions .
smaller stores can ’ t afford to offer the price cuts and rebates the larger chains offer .
as a result , customers empty the shelves of big stores first , and the books in the smaller ones gather dust .
in germany , the actual number of book stores has not changed dramatically over the last several years .
the association of german publishers and booksellers listed 4,661 stores for 2002 .
that ’ s only nine fewer than in 1997 .
but the numbers are deceptive .
for every small store that closes , a bigger chain moves in .
and the percentage of the market is increasing for the larger chains while it decreases for the independent stores .
the 10 biggest bookstores in germany accounted for 1.2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- of the 5.44 million euro -lrb- $ 5.43 million -rrb- in overall book sales for 2001 .
the marketing division of the booksellers association could not give exact statistics as to what percent of the market is in the hands of the nation-wide chains , but the spokesperson gertraud majer said she " suspects the chains are taking an ever larger share at the expense of the small stores .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .
the results of their research and the glacial photo documentation have been published on the internet under the web site www.gletscherarchiv.de.
looking at the pictures , the differences between then and now are obvious .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .
the results of their research and the glacial photo documentation have been published on the internet under the web site www.gletscherarchiv.de.
looking at the pictures , the differences between then and now are obvious .
the pictures tell the whole story - the glaciers are rapidly disappearing .

with evening events and espresso bars , sitting areas and cd lounges , germany ’ s modern super-bookstores are driving out smaller independent shops in the ever more competitive book market . for some time now , independent bookstores in germany have been going through a series of structural changes .
competition from mega bookstore chains the size of department stores has been driving out smaller mom and pop shops from their traditional urban basis .
the small local shops , with their customer-oriented service and individual approach to selling books , simply can not compete with the larger mass-market chains , and a good number of them have been forced to close .
many of these small shops have suffered significant financial losses , though these are mostly attributed to the general slump in book sales in germany .
compared to the last 25 years when sales figures remained fairly stagnate , the first five months of 2002 recorded a 2.1 percent decline in sales .
hard times for small booksellers the drop in book sales has affected the entire branch .
the traditional berlin-based kiepert , a local bookstore with several shops throughout the city , was only able to pay 70 percent of employee wages in may , and in june close to a third of its 170 employees were laid off .
in july , the industry journal " buchmarkt " reported that the kiepert family had requested distributors to temporarily forgive up to 60 percent of the bookstore ’ s debts .
if the situation doesn ’ t improve soon , the company says it will have to close some of its branches .
in the last year alone , 30 of berlin ’ s 330 bookstores were forced to close their doors after suffering heavy financial losses .
this year , 11 have closed shop , including some of the city ’ s longest-operating booksellers .
but berlin is not alone .
throughout germany bookstores are struggling to survive in the face of a major downturn in consumer spending .
the cologne-based alibi , an independent bookstore specializing in detective novels , was hit so hard by the sales slump that it was forced to vacate its street-front property and move into the basement of another independent bookseller .
but its sales have plummeted even further now that the store is no longer so visible , and it ’ s only a question of time before the small business closes altogether .
big book businesses struggling too declining sales are not only a problem for independent booksellers .
the large nation-wide chains have been struck equally as hard .
germany ’ s second largest bookstore , hugendubel , which has 1,100 employees at 28 stores , has announced it will cut employee hours to make up for the loss of this year ’ s profits .
dieter schormann , chairman of the association of german publishers and booksellers in germany , has expressed concern about the current situation .
" at this point , we have no idea when the situation will improve .
that makes it very depressing , " he told the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " when the dwindling sales figures came out .
but detlef bluhm , manager of the berlin association of publishers and booksellers , says " the average sales figures don ’ t tell the whole story . "
the market has more ups and downs .
" some businesses are suffering two figure losses whereas others are growing , " he says pointing to the country ’ s top bookseller thalia which has increased sales by 0.8 percent .
too much competition bad for some ?
the inconsistency in market sales has led to an extremely competitive business landscape in germany .
from small to big and independent to franchise , bookstores are fighting for the consumer ’ s remaining euros .
" it used to be that there was an unspoken rule in the industry not to open a new book store a 100 meters away from an existing one , " says christine böse , assistant store manager for bouvier , a regional book chain based in bonn .
" today , that ’ s no longer the case .
bookstores are expanding much more aggressively , " she says .
and each time a new store opens , it detracts business from older ones .
this is particularly true when the new store on the block is a big chain .
in the last few years , the country ’ s biggest bookstores have continued to expand while the number of smaller ones has shrunk .
krefeld , a mid-size western german city in north rhine-westphalia , is a good example of this trend .
when two of germany ’ s biggest chains moved in , seven of the city ’ s traditional independent stores shut down .
they couldn ’ t compete with the bigger , more modern stores .
in berlin , at the same time the 30 independent booksellers folded , big chains with over 30,000 square meters of sales space -lrb- 322,900 square feet -rrb- expanded their presence in the city .
and the mega-bookstores aren ’ t done taking over germany ’ s capital .
thomas nitz , manager of hugendubel , says the city ’ s book demand is not quite " satiated " .
there ’ s still room for growth , he told " buchreport " .
a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .
the bigger the store , the bigger the price reductions .
smaller stores can ’ t afford to offer the price cuts and rebates the larger chains offer .
as a result , customers empty the shelves of big stores first , and the books in the smaller ones gather dust .
in germany , the actual number of book stores has not changed dramatically over the last several years .
the association of german publishers and booksellers listed 4,661 stores for 2002 .
that ’ s only nine fewer than in 1997 .
but the numbers are deceptive .
for every small store that closes , a bigger chain moves in .
and the percentage of the market is increasing for the larger chains while it decreases for the independent stores .
the 10 biggest bookstores in germany accounted for 1.2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- of the 5.44 million euro -lrb- $ 5.43 million -rrb- in overall book sales for 2001 .
the marketing division of the booksellers association could not give exact statistics as to what percent of the market is in the hands of the nation-wide chains , but the spokesperson gertraud majer said she " suspects the chains are taking an ever larger share at the expense of the small stores .

with evening events and espresso bars , sitting areas and cd lounges , germany ’ s modern super-bookstores are driving out smaller independent shops in the ever more competitive book market . for some time now , independent bookstores in germany have been going through a series of structural changes .
competition from mega bookstore chains the size of department stores has been driving out smaller mom and pop shops from their traditional urban basis .
the small local shops , with their customer-oriented service and individual approach to selling books , simply can not compete with the larger mass-market chains , and a good number of them have been forced to close .
many of these small shops have suffered significant financial losses , though these are mostly attributed to the general slump in book sales in germany .
compared to the last 25 years when sales figures remained fairly stagnate , the first five months of 2002 recorded a 2.1 percent decline in sales .
hard times for small booksellers the drop in book sales has affected the entire branch .
the traditional berlin-based kiepert , a local bookstore with several shops throughout the city , was only able to pay 70 percent of employee wages in may , and in june close to a third of its 170 employees were laid off .
in july , the industry journal " buchmarkt " reported that the kiepert family had requested distributors to temporarily forgive up to 60 percent of the bookstore ’ s debts .
if the situation doesn ’ t improve soon , the company says it will have to close some of its branches .
in the last year alone , 30 of berlin ’ s 330 bookstores were forced to close their doors after suffering heavy financial losses .
this year , 11 have closed shop , including some of the city ’ s longest-operating booksellers .
but berlin is not alone .
throughout germany bookstores are struggling to survive in the face of a major downturn in consumer spending .
the cologne-based alibi , an independent bookstore specializing in detective novels , was hit so hard by the sales slump that it was forced to vacate its street-front property and move into the basement of another independent bookseller .
but its sales have plummeted even further now that the store is no longer so visible , and it ’ s only a question of time before the small business closes altogether .
big book businesses struggling too declining sales are not only a problem for independent booksellers .
the large nation-wide chains have been struck equally as hard .
germany ’ s second largest bookstore , hugendubel , which has 1,100 employees at 28 stores , has announced it will cut employee hours to make up for the loss of this year ’ s profits .
dieter schormann , chairman of the association of german publishers and booksellers in germany , has expressed concern about the current situation .
" at this point , we have no idea when the situation will improve .
that makes it very depressing , " he told the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " when the dwindling sales figures came out .
but detlef bluhm , manager of the berlin association of publishers and booksellers , says " the average sales figures don ’ t tell the whole story . "
the market has more ups and downs .
" some businesses are suffering two figure losses whereas others are growing , " he says pointing to the country ’ s top bookseller thalia which has increased sales by 0.8 percent .
too much competition bad for some ?
the inconsistency in market sales has led to an extremely competitive business landscape in germany .
from small to big and independent to franchise , bookstores are fighting for the consumer ’ s remaining euros .
" it used to be that there was an unspoken rule in the industry not to open a new book store a 100 meters away from an existing one , " says christine böse , assistant store manager for bouvier , a regional book chain based in bonn .
" today , that ’ s no longer the case .
bookstores are expanding much more aggressively , " she says .
and each time a new store opens , it detracts business from older ones .
this is particularly true when the new store on the block is a big chain .
in the last few years , the country ’ s biggest bookstores have continued to expand while the number of smaller ones has shrunk .
krefeld , a mid-size western german city in north rhine-westphalia , is a good example of this trend .
when two of germany ’ s biggest chains moved in , seven of the city ’ s traditional independent stores shut down .
they couldn ’ t compete with the bigger , more modern stores .
in berlin , at the same time the 30 independent booksellers folded , big chains with over 30,000 square meters of sales space -lrb- 322,900 square feet -rrb- expanded their presence in the city .
and the mega-bookstores aren ’ t done taking over germany ’ s capital .
thomas nitz , manager of hugendubel , says the city ’ s book demand is not quite " satiated " .
there ’ s still room for growth , he told " buchreport " .
a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .
the bigger the store , the bigger the price reductions .
smaller stores can ’ t afford to offer the price cuts and rebates the larger chains offer .
as a result , customers empty the shelves of big stores first , and the books in the smaller ones gather dust .
in germany , the actual number of book stores has not changed dramatically over the last several years .
the association of german publishers and booksellers listed 4,661 stores for 2002 .
that ’ s only nine fewer than in 1997 .
but the numbers are deceptive .
for every small store that closes , a bigger chain moves in .
and the percentage of the market is increasing for the larger chains while it decreases for the independent stores .
the 10 biggest bookstores in germany accounted for 1.2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- of the 5.44 million euro -lrb- $ 5.43 million -rrb- in overall book sales for 2001 .
the marketing division of the booksellers association could not give exact statistics as to what percent of the market is in the hands of the nation-wide chains , but the spokesperson gertraud majer said she " suspects the chains are taking an ever larger share at the expense of the small stores .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .
the results of their research and the glacial photo documentation have been published on the internet under the web site www.gletscherarchiv.de.
looking at the pictures , the differences between then and now are obvious .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .

with evening events and espresso bars , sitting areas and cd lounges , germany ’ s modern super-bookstores are driving out smaller independent shops in the ever more competitive book market . for some time now , independent bookstores in germany have been going through a series of structural changes .
competition from mega bookstore chains the size of department stores has been driving out smaller mom and pop shops from their traditional urban basis .
the small local shops , with their customer-oriented service and individual approach to selling books , simply can not compete with the larger mass-market chains , and a good number of them have been forced to close .
many of these small shops have suffered significant financial losses , though these are mostly attributed to the general slump in book sales in germany .
compared to the last 25 years when sales figures remained fairly stagnate , the first five months of 2002 recorded a 2.1 percent decline in sales .
hard times for small booksellers the drop in book sales has affected the entire branch .
the traditional berlin-based kiepert , a local bookstore with several shops throughout the city , was only able to pay 70 percent of employee wages in may , and in june close to a third of its 170 employees were laid off .
in july , the industry journal " buchmarkt " reported that the kiepert family had requested distributors to temporarily forgive up to 60 percent of the bookstore ’ s debts .
if the situation doesn ’ t improve soon , the company says it will have to close some of its branches .
in the last year alone , 30 of berlin ’ s 330 bookstores were forced to close their doors after suffering heavy financial losses .
this year , 11 have closed shop , including some of the city ’ s longest-operating booksellers .
but berlin is not alone .
throughout germany bookstores are struggling to survive in the face of a major downturn in consumer spending .
the cologne-based alibi , an independent bookstore specializing in detective novels , was hit so hard by the sales slump that it was forced to vacate its street-front property and move into the basement of another independent bookseller .
but its sales have plummeted even further now that the store is no longer so visible , and it ’ s only a question of time before the small business closes altogether .
big book businesses struggling too declining sales are not only a problem for independent booksellers .
the large nation-wide chains have been struck equally as hard .
germany ’ s second largest bookstore , hugendubel , which has 1,100 employees at 28 stores , has announced it will cut employee hours to make up for the loss of this year ’ s profits .
dieter schormann , chairman of the association of german publishers and booksellers in germany , has expressed concern about the current situation .
" at this point , we have no idea when the situation will improve .
that makes it very depressing , " he told the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " when the dwindling sales figures came out .
but detlef bluhm , manager of the berlin association of publishers and booksellers , says " the average sales figures don ’ t tell the whole story . "
the market has more ups and downs .
" some businesses are suffering two figure losses whereas others are growing , " he says pointing to the country ’ s top bookseller thalia which has increased sales by 0.8 percent .
too much competition bad for some ?
the inconsistency in market sales has led to an extremely competitive business landscape in germany .
from small to big and independent to franchise , bookstores are fighting for the consumer ’ s remaining euros .
" it used to be that there was an unspoken rule in the industry not to open a new book store a 100 meters away from an existing one , " says christine böse , assistant store manager for bouvier , a regional book chain based in bonn .
" today , that ’ s no longer the case .
bookstores are expanding much more aggressively , " she says .
and each time a new store opens , it detracts business from older ones .
this is particularly true when the new store on the block is a big chain .
in the last few years , the country ’ s biggest bookstores have continued to expand while the number of smaller ones has shrunk .
krefeld , a mid-size western german city in north rhine-westphalia , is a good example of this trend .
when two of germany ’ s biggest chains moved in , seven of the city ’ s traditional independent stores shut down .
they couldn ’ t compete with the bigger , more modern stores .
in berlin , at the same time the 30 independent booksellers folded , big chains with over 30,000 square meters of sales space -lrb- 322,900 square feet -rrb- expanded their presence in the city .
and the mega-bookstores aren ’ t done taking over germany ’ s capital .
thomas nitz , manager of hugendubel , says the city ’ s book demand is not quite " satiated " .
there ’ s still room for growth , he told " buchreport " .
a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .
the bigger the store , the bigger the price reductions .
smaller stores can ’ t afford to offer the price cuts and rebates the larger chains offer .
as a result , customers empty the shelves of big stores first , and the books in the smaller ones gather dust .
in germany , the actual number of book stores has not changed dramatically over the last several years .
the association of german publishers and booksellers listed 4,661 stores for 2002 .
that ’ s only nine fewer than in 1997 .
but the numbers are deceptive .
for every small store that closes , a bigger chain moves in .
and the percentage of the market is increasing for the larger chains while it decreases for the independent stores .
the 10 biggest bookstores in germany accounted for 1.2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- of the 5.44 million euro -lrb- $ 5.43 million -rrb- in overall book sales for 2001 .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .
the results of their research and the glacial photo documentation have been published on the internet under the web site www.gletscherarchiv.de.
looking at the pictures , the differences between then and now are obvious .
the pictures tell the whole story - the glaciers are rapidly disappearing .

with evening events and espresso bars , sitting areas and cd lounges , germany ’ s modern super-bookstores are driving out smaller independent shops in the ever more competitive book market . for some time now , independent bookstores in germany have been going through a series of structural changes .
competition from mega bookstore chains the size of department stores has been driving out smaller mom and pop shops from their traditional urban basis .
the small local shops , with their customer-oriented service and individual approach to selling books , simply can not compete with the larger mass-market chains , and a good number of them have been forced to close .
many of these small shops have suffered significant financial losses , though these are mostly attributed to the general slump in book sales in germany .
compared to the last 25 years when sales figures remained fairly stagnate , the first five months of 2002 recorded a 2.1 percent decline in sales .
hard times for small booksellers the drop in book sales has affected the entire branch .
the traditional berlin-based kiepert , a local bookstore with several shops throughout the city , was only able to pay 70 percent of employee wages in may , and in june close to a third of its 170 employees were laid off .
in july , the industry journal " buchmarkt " reported that the kiepert family had requested distributors to temporarily forgive up to 60 percent of the bookstore ’ s debts .
if the situation doesn ’ t improve soon , the company says it will have to close some of its branches .
in the last year alone , 30 of berlin ’ s 330 bookstores were forced to close their doors after suffering heavy financial losses .
this year , 11 have closed shop , including some of the city ’ s longest-operating booksellers .
but berlin is not alone .
throughout germany bookstores are struggling to survive in the face of a major downturn in consumer spending .
the cologne-based alibi , an independent bookstore specializing in detective novels , was hit so hard by the sales slump that it was forced to vacate its street-front property and move into the basement of another independent bookseller .
but its sales have plummeted even further now that the store is no longer so visible , and it ’ s only a question of time before the small business closes altogether .
big book businesses struggling too declining sales are not only a problem for independent booksellers .
the large nation-wide chains have been struck equally as hard .
germany ’ s second largest bookstore , hugendubel , which has 1,100 employees at 28 stores , has announced it will cut employee hours to make up for the loss of this year ’ s profits .
dieter schormann , chairman of the association of german publishers and booksellers in germany , has expressed concern about the current situation .
" at this point , we have no idea when the situation will improve .
that makes it very depressing , " he told the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " when the dwindling sales figures came out .
but detlef bluhm , manager of the berlin association of publishers and booksellers , says " the average sales figures don ’ t tell the whole story . "
the market has more ups and downs .
" some businesses are suffering two figure losses whereas others are growing , " he says pointing to the country ’ s top bookseller thalia which has increased sales by 0.8 percent .
too much competition bad for some ?
the inconsistency in market sales has led to an extremely competitive business landscape in germany .
from small to big and independent to franchise , bookstores are fighting for the consumer ’ s remaining euros .
" it used to be that there was an unspoken rule in the industry not to open a new book store a 100 meters away from an existing one , " says christine böse , assistant store manager for bouvier , a regional book chain based in bonn .
" today , that ’ s no longer the case .
bookstores are expanding much more aggressively , " she says .
and each time a new store opens , it detracts business from older ones .
this is particularly true when the new store on the block is a big chain .
in the last few years , the country ’ s biggest bookstores have continued to expand while the number of smaller ones has shrunk .
krefeld , a mid-size western german city in north rhine-westphalia , is a good example of this trend .
when two of germany ’ s biggest chains moved in , seven of the city ’ s traditional independent stores shut down .
they couldn ’ t compete with the bigger , more modern stores .
in berlin , at the same time the 30 independent booksellers folded , big chains with over 30,000 square meters of sales space -lrb- 322,900 square feet -rrb- expanded their presence in the city .
and the mega-bookstores aren ’ t done taking over germany ’ s capital .
thomas nitz , manager of hugendubel , says the city ’ s book demand is not quite " satiated " .
there ’ s still room for growth , he told " buchreport " .
a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .
the bigger the store , the bigger the price reductions .
smaller stores can ’ t afford to offer the price cuts and rebates the larger chains offer .
as a result , customers empty the shelves of big stores first , and the books in the smaller ones gather dust .
in germany , the actual number of book stores has not changed dramatically over the last several years .
the association of german publishers and booksellers listed 4,661 stores for 2002 .
that ’ s only nine fewer than in 1997 .
but the numbers are deceptive .
for every small store that closes , a bigger chain moves in .
and the percentage of the market is increasing for the larger chains while it decreases for the independent stores .
the 10 biggest bookstores in germany accounted for 1.2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- of the 5.44 million euro -lrb- $ 5.43 million -rrb- in overall book sales for 2001 .

this year , 11 have closed shop , including some of the city ’ s longest-operating booksellers .
but berlin is not alone .
throughout germany bookstores are struggling to survive in the face of a major downturn in consumer spending .
the cologne-based alibi , an independent bookstore specializing in detective novels , was hit so hard by the sales slump that it was forced to vacate its street-front property and move into the basement of another independent bookseller .
but its sales have plummeted even further now that the store is no longer so visible , and it ’ s only a question of time before the small business closes altogether .
big book businesses struggling too declining sales are not only a problem for independent booksellers .
the large nation-wide chains have been struck equally as hard .
germany ’ s second largest bookstore , hugendubel , which has 1,100 employees at 28 stores , has announced it will cut employee hours to make up for the loss of this year ’ s profits .
dieter schormann , chairman of the association of german publishers and booksellers in germany , has expressed concern about the current situation .
" at this point , we have no idea when the situation will improve .
that makes it very depressing , " he told the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " when the dwindling sales figures came out .
but detlef bluhm , manager of the berlin association of publishers and booksellers , says " the average sales figures don ’ t tell the whole story . "
the market has more ups and downs .
" some businesses are suffering two figure losses whereas others are growing , " he says pointing to the country ’ s top bookseller thalia which has increased sales by 0.8 percent .
too much competition bad for some ?
the inconsistency in market sales has led to an extremely competitive business landscape in germany .
from small to big and independent to franchise , bookstores are fighting for the consumer ’ s remaining euros .
" it used to be that there was an unspoken rule in the industry not to open a new book store a 100 meters away from an existing one , " says christine böse , assistant store manager for bouvier , a regional book chain based in bonn .
" today , that ’ s no longer the case .
bookstores are expanding much more aggressively , " she says .
and each time a new store opens , it detracts business from older ones .
this is particularly true when the new store on the block is a big chain .
in the last few years , the country ’ s biggest bookstores have continued to expand while the number of smaller ones has shrunk .
krefeld , a mid-size western german city in north rhine-westphalia , is a good example of this trend .
when two of germany ’ s biggest chains moved in , seven of the city ’ s traditional independent stores shut down .
they couldn ’ t compete with the bigger , more modern stores .
in berlin , at the same time the 30 independent booksellers folded , big chains with over 30,000 square meters of sales space -lrb- 322,900 square feet -rrb- expanded their presence in the city .
and the mega-bookstores aren ’ t done taking over germany ’ s capital .
thomas nitz , manager of hugendubel , says the city ’ s book demand is not quite " satiated " .
there ’ s still room for growth , he told " buchreport " .
a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .
the bigger the store , the bigger the price reductions .
smaller stores can ’ t afford to offer the price cuts and rebates the larger chains offer .
as a result , customers empty the shelves of big stores first , and the books in the smaller ones gather dust .
in germany , the actual number of book stores has not changed dramatically over the last several years .
the association of german publishers and booksellers listed 4,661 stores for 2002 .
that ’ s only nine fewer than in 1997 .
but the numbers are deceptive .
for every small store that closes , a bigger chain moves in .
and the percentage of the market is increasing for the larger chains while it decreases for the independent stores .
the 10 biggest bookstores in germany accounted for 1.2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- of the 5.44 million euro -lrb- $ 5.43 million -rrb- in overall book sales for 2001 .
the marketing division of the booksellers association could not give exact statistics as to what percent of the market is in the hands of the nation-wide chains , but the spokesperson gertraud majer said she " suspects the chains are taking an ever larger share at the expense of the small stores .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .

with evening events and espresso bars , sitting areas and cd lounges , germany ’ s modern super-bookstores are driving out smaller independent shops in the ever more competitive book market . for some time now , independent bookstores in germany have been going through a series of structural changes .
competition from mega bookstore chains the size of department stores has been driving out smaller mom and pop shops from their traditional urban basis .
the small local shops , with their customer-oriented service and individual approach to selling books , simply can not compete with the larger mass-market chains , and a good number of them have been forced to close .
many of these small shops have suffered significant financial losses , though these are mostly attributed to the general slump in book sales in germany .
compared to the last 25 years when sales figures remained fairly stagnate , the first five months of 2002 recorded a 2.1 percent decline in sales .
hard times for small booksellers the drop in book sales has affected the entire branch .
the traditional berlin-based kiepert , a local bookstore with several shops throughout the city , was only able to pay 70 percent of employee wages in may , and in june close to a third of its 170 employees were laid off .
in july , the industry journal " buchmarkt " reported that the kiepert family had requested distributors to temporarily forgive up to 60 percent of the bookstore ’ s debts .
if the situation doesn ’ t improve soon , the company says it will have to close some of its branches .
in the last year alone , 30 of berlin ’ s 330 bookstores were forced to close their doors after suffering heavy financial losses .
this year , 11 have closed shop , including some of the city ’ s longest-operating booksellers .
but berlin is not alone .
throughout germany bookstores are struggling to survive in the face of a major downturn in consumer spending .

a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .
the results of their research and the glacial photo documentation have been published on the internet under the web site www.gletscherarchiv.de.
looking at the pictures , the differences between then and now are obvious .
the pictures tell the whole story - the glaciers are rapidly disappearing .
" we are witnesses to the fastest glacial melting in a thousand years , " the society for environmental research writes on their web site .

with evening events and espresso bars , sitting areas and cd lounges , germany ’ s modern super-bookstores are driving out smaller independent shops in the ever more competitive book market . for some time now , independent bookstores in germany have been going through a series of structural changes .
competition from mega bookstore chains the size of department stores has been driving out smaller mom and pop shops from their traditional urban basis .
the small local shops , with their customer-oriented service and individual approach to selling books , simply can not compete with the larger mass-market chains , and a good number of them have been forced to close .
many of these small shops have suffered significant financial losses , though these are mostly attributed to the general slump in book sales in germany .
compared to the last 25 years when sales figures remained fairly stagnate , the first five months of 2002 recorded a 2.1 percent decline in sales .
hard times for small booksellers the drop in book sales has affected the entire branch .
the traditional berlin-based kiepert , a local bookstore with several shops throughout the city , was only able to pay 70 percent of employee wages in may , and in june close to a third of its 170 employees were laid off .
in july , the industry journal " buchmarkt " reported that the kiepert family had requested distributors to temporarily forgive up to 60 percent of the bookstore ’ s debts .
if the situation doesn ’ t improve soon , the company says it will have to close some of its branches .
in the last year alone , 30 of berlin ’ s 330 bookstores were forced to close their doors after suffering heavy financial losses .
this year , 11 have closed shop , including some of the city ’ s longest-operating booksellers .
but berlin is not alone .
throughout germany bookstores are struggling to survive in the face of a major downturn in consumer spending .
the cologne-based alibi , an independent bookstore specializing in detective novels , was hit so hard by the sales slump that it was forced to vacate its street-front property and move into the basement of another independent bookseller .
but its sales have plummeted even further now that the store is no longer so visible , and it ’ s only a question of time before the small business closes altogether .
big book businesses struggling too declining sales are not only a problem for independent booksellers .
the large nation-wide chains have been struck equally as hard .
germany ’ s second largest bookstore , hugendubel , which has 1,100 employees at 28 stores , has announced it will cut employee hours to make up for the loss of this year ’ s profits .
dieter schormann , chairman of the association of german publishers and booksellers in germany , has expressed concern about the current situation .
" at this point , we have no idea when the situation will improve .
that makes it very depressing , " he told the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " when the dwindling sales figures came out .
but detlef bluhm , manager of the berlin association of publishers and booksellers , says " the average sales figures don ’ t tell the whole story . "
the market has more ups and downs .
" some businesses are suffering two figure losses whereas others are growing , " he says pointing to the country ’ s top bookseller thalia which has increased sales by 0.8 percent .
too much competition bad for some ?
the inconsistency in market sales has led to an extremely competitive business landscape in germany .
from small to big and independent to franchise , bookstores are fighting for the consumer ’ s remaining euros .
" it used to be that there was an unspoken rule in the industry not to open a new book store a 100 meters away from an existing one , " says christine böse , assistant store manager for bouvier , a regional book chain based in bonn .
" today , that ’ s no longer the case .
bookstores are expanding much more aggressively , " she says .
and each time a new store opens , it detracts business from older ones .
this is particularly true when the new store on the block is a big chain .
in the last few years , the country ’ s biggest bookstores have continued to expand while the number of smaller ones has shrunk .
krefeld , a mid-size western german city in north rhine-westphalia , is a good example of this trend .
when two of germany ’ s biggest chains moved in , seven of the city ’ s traditional independent stores shut down .
they couldn ’ t compete with the bigger , more modern stores .
in berlin , at the same time the 30 independent booksellers folded , big chains with over 30,000 square meters of sales space -lrb- 322,900 square feet -rrb- expanded their presence in the city .
and the mega-bookstores aren ’ t done taking over germany ’ s capital .
thomas nitz , manager of hugendubel , says the city ’ s book demand is not quite " satiated " .
there ’ s still room for growth , he told " buchreport " .
a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .
the bigger the store , the bigger the price reductions .
smaller stores can ’ t afford to offer the price cuts and rebates the larger chains offer .
as a result , customers empty the shelves of big stores first , and the books in the smaller ones gather dust .
in germany , the actual number of book stores has not changed dramatically over the last several years .
the association of german publishers and booksellers listed 4,661 stores for 2002 .
that ’ s only nine fewer than in 1997 .
but the numbers are deceptive .
for every small store that closes , a bigger chain moves in .
and the percentage of the market is increasing for the larger chains while it decreases for the independent stores .
the 10 biggest bookstores in germany accounted for 1.2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- of the 5.44 million euro -lrb- $ 5.43 million -rrb- in overall book sales for 2001 .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .
the results of their research and the glacial photo documentation have been published on the internet under the web site www.gletscherarchiv.de.
looking at the pictures , the differences between then and now are obvious .
the pictures tell the whole story - the glaciers are rapidly disappearing .
" we are witnesses to the fastest glacial melting in a thousand years , " the society for environmental research writes on their web site .
" but today we are lucky that we can still see the glaciers . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" it used to be that there was an unspoken rule in the industry not to open a new book store a 100 meters away from an existing one , " says christine böse , assistant store manager for bouvier , a regional book chain based in bonn .
" today , that ’ s no longer the case .
bookstores are expanding much more aggressively , " she says .
and each time a new store opens , it detracts business from older ones .
this is particularly true when the new store on the block is a big chain .
in the last few years , the country ’ s biggest bookstores have continued to expand while the number of smaller ones has shrunk .
krefeld , a mid-size western german city in north rhine-westphalia , is a good example of this trend .
when two of germany ’ s biggest chains moved in , seven of the city ’ s traditional independent stores shut down .
they couldn ’ t compete with the bigger , more modern stores .
in berlin , at the same time the 30 independent booksellers folded , big chains with over 30,000 square meters of sales space -lrb- 322,900 square feet -rrb- expanded their presence in the city .
and the mega-bookstores aren ’ t done taking over germany ’ s capital .
thomas nitz , manager of hugendubel , says the city ’ s book demand is not quite " satiated " .
there ’ s still room for growth , he told " buchreport " .
a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .
the bigger the store , the bigger the price reductions .
smaller stores can ’ t afford to offer the price cuts and rebates the larger chains offer .
as a result , customers empty the shelves of big stores first , and the books in the smaller ones gather dust .
in germany , the actual number of book stores has not changed dramatically over the last several years .
the association of german publishers and booksellers listed 4,661 stores for 2002 .
that ’ s only nine fewer than in 1997 .
but the numbers are deceptive .
for every small store that closes , a bigger chain moves in .
and the percentage of the market is increasing for the larger chains while it decreases for the independent stores .
the 10 biggest bookstores in germany accounted for 1.2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- of the 5.44 million euro -lrb- $ 5.43 million -rrb- in overall book sales for 2001 .
the marketing division of the booksellers association could not give exact statistics as to what percent of the market is in the hands of the nation-wide chains , but the spokesperson gertraud majer said she " suspects the chains are taking an ever larger share at the expense of the small stores .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .

with evening events and espresso bars , sitting areas and cd lounges , germany ’ s modern super-bookstores are driving out smaller independent shops in the ever more competitive book market . for some time now , independent bookstores in germany have been going through a series of structural changes .
competition from mega bookstore chains the size of department stores has been driving out smaller mom and pop shops from their traditional urban basis .
the small local shops , with their customer-oriented service and individual approach to selling books , simply can not compete with the larger mass-market chains , and a good number of them have been forced to close .
many of these small shops have suffered significant financial losses , though these are mostly attributed to the general slump in book sales in germany .
compared to the last 25 years when sales figures remained fairly stagnate , the first five months of 2002 recorded a 2.1 percent decline in sales .
hard times for small booksellers the drop in book sales has affected the entire branch .
the traditional berlin-based kiepert , a local bookstore with several shops throughout the city , was only able to pay 70 percent of employee wages in may , and in june close to a third of its 170 employees were laid off .
in july , the industry journal " buchmarkt " reported that the kiepert family had requested distributors to temporarily forgive up to 60 percent of the bookstore ’ s debts .
if the situation doesn ’ t improve soon , the company says it will have to close some of its branches .
in the last year alone , 30 of berlin ’ s 330 bookstores were forced to close their doors after suffering heavy financial losses .
this year , 11 have closed shop , including some of the city ’ s longest-operating booksellers .
but berlin is not alone .
throughout germany bookstores are struggling to survive in the face of a major downturn in consumer spending .
the cologne-based alibi , an independent bookstore specializing in detective novels , was hit so hard by the sales slump that it was forced to vacate its street-front property and move into the basement of another independent bookseller .
but its sales have plummeted even further now that the store is no longer so visible , and it ’ s only a question of time before the small business closes altogether .
big book businesses struggling too declining sales are not only a problem for independent booksellers .
the large nation-wide chains have been struck equally as hard .
germany ’ s second largest bookstore , hugendubel , which has 1,100 employees at 28 stores , has announced it will cut employee hours to make up for the loss of this year ’ s profits .
dieter schormann , chairman of the association of german publishers and booksellers in germany , has expressed concern about the current situation .
" at this point , we have no idea when the situation will improve .
that makes it very depressing , " he told the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " when the dwindling sales figures came out .
but detlef bluhm , manager of the berlin association of publishers and booksellers , says " the average sales figures don ’ t tell the whole story . "
the market has more ups and downs .
" some businesses are suffering two figure losses whereas others are growing , " he says pointing to the country ’ s top bookseller thalia which has increased sales by 0.8 percent .
too much competition bad for some ?
the inconsistency in market sales has led to an extremely competitive business landscape in germany .
from small to big and independent to franchise , bookstores are fighting for the consumer ’ s remaining euros .
" it used to be that there was an unspoken rule in the industry not to open a new book store a 100 meters away from an existing one , " says christine böse , assistant store manager for bouvier , a regional book chain based in bonn .
" today , that ’ s no longer the case .

a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .
the results of their research and the glacial photo documentation have been published on the internet under the web site www.gletscherarchiv.de.
looking at the pictures , the differences between then and now are obvious .
the pictures tell the whole story - the glaciers are rapidly disappearing .

equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .
the results of their research and the glacial photo documentation have been published on the internet under the web site www.gletscherarchiv.de.
looking at the pictures , the differences between then and now are obvious .
the pictures tell the whole story - the glaciers are rapidly disappearing .
" we are witnesses to the fastest glacial melting in a thousand years , " the society for environmental research writes on their web site .

with evening events and espresso bars , sitting areas and cd lounges , germany ’ s modern super-bookstores are driving out smaller independent shops in the ever more competitive book market . for some time now , independent bookstores in germany have been going through a series of structural changes .
competition from mega bookstore chains the size of department stores has been driving out smaller mom and pop shops from their traditional urban basis .
the small local shops , with their customer-oriented service and individual approach to selling books , simply can not compete with the larger mass-market chains , and a good number of them have been forced to close .
many of these small shops have suffered significant financial losses , though these are mostly attributed to the general slump in book sales in germany .
compared to the last 25 years when sales figures remained fairly stagnate , the first five months of 2002 recorded a 2.1 percent decline in sales .
hard times for small booksellers the drop in book sales has affected the entire branch .
the traditional berlin-based kiepert , a local bookstore with several shops throughout the city , was only able to pay 70 percent of employee wages in may , and in june close to a third of its 170 employees were laid off .
in july , the industry journal " buchmarkt " reported that the kiepert family had requested distributors to temporarily forgive up to 60 percent of the bookstore ’ s debts .
if the situation doesn ’ t improve soon , the company says it will have to close some of its branches .
in the last year alone , 30 of berlin ’ s 330 bookstores were forced to close their doors after suffering heavy financial losses .

big book businesses struggling too declining sales are not only a problem for independent booksellers .

germany ’ s second largest bookstore , hugendubel , which has 1,100 employees at 28 stores , has announced it will cut employee hours to make up for the loss of this year ’ s profits .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .
the results of their research and the glacial photo documentation have been published on the internet under the web site www.gletscherarchiv.de.

with evening events and espresso bars , sitting areas and cd lounges , germany ’ s modern super-bookstores are driving out smaller independent shops in the ever more competitive book market . for some time now , independent bookstores in germany have been going through a series of structural changes .
competition from mega bookstore chains the size of department stores has been driving out smaller mom and pop shops from their traditional urban basis .
the small local shops , with their customer-oriented service and individual approach to selling books , simply can not compete with the larger mass-market chains , and a good number of them have been forced to close .
many of these small shops have suffered significant financial losses , though these are mostly attributed to the general slump in book sales in germany .
compared to the last 25 years when sales figures remained fairly stagnate , the first five months of 2002 recorded a 2.1 percent decline in sales .
hard times for small booksellers the drop in book sales has affected the entire branch .
the traditional berlin-based kiepert , a local bookstore with several shops throughout the city , was only able to pay 70 percent of employee wages in may , and in june close to a third of its 170 employees were laid off .
in july , the industry journal " buchmarkt " reported that the kiepert family had requested distributors to temporarily forgive up to 60 percent of the bookstore ’ s debts .
if the situation doesn ’ t improve soon , the company says it will have to close some of its branches .
in the last year alone , 30 of berlin ’ s 330 bookstores were forced to close their doors after suffering heavy financial losses .
this year , 11 have closed shop , including some of the city ’ s longest-operating booksellers .
but berlin is not alone .
throughout germany bookstores are struggling to survive in the face of a major downturn in consumer spending .
the cologne-based alibi , an independent bookstore specializing in detective novels , was hit so hard by the sales slump that it was forced to vacate its street-front property and move into the basement of another independent bookseller .
but its sales have plummeted even further now that the store is no longer so visible , and it ’ s only a question of time before the small business closes altogether .
big book businesses struggling too declining sales are not only a problem for independent booksellers .
the large nation-wide chains have been struck equally as hard .
germany ’ s second largest bookstore , hugendubel , which has 1,100 employees at 28 stores , has announced it will cut employee hours to make up for the loss of this year ’ s profits .
dieter schormann , chairman of the association of german publishers and booksellers in germany , has expressed concern about the current situation .
" at this point , we have no idea when the situation will improve .
that makes it very depressing , " he told the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " when the dwindling sales figures came out .
but detlef bluhm , manager of the berlin association of publishers and booksellers , says " the average sales figures don ’ t tell the whole story . "
the market has more ups and downs .
" some businesses are suffering two figure losses whereas others are growing , " he says pointing to the country ’ s top bookseller thalia which has increased sales by 0.8 percent .
too much competition bad for some ?
the inconsistency in market sales has led to an extremely competitive business landscape in germany .
from small to big and independent to franchise , bookstores are fighting for the consumer ’ s remaining euros .
" it used to be that there was an unspoken rule in the industry not to open a new book store a 100 meters away from an existing one , " says christine böse , assistant store manager for bouvier , a regional book chain based in bonn .
" today , that ’ s no longer the case .
bookstores are expanding much more aggressively , " she says .
and each time a new store opens , it detracts business from older ones .
this is particularly true when the new store on the block is a big chain .
in the last few years , the country ’ s biggest bookstores have continued to expand while the number of smaller ones has shrunk .
krefeld , a mid-size western german city in north rhine-westphalia , is a good example of this trend .
when two of germany ’ s biggest chains moved in , seven of the city ’ s traditional independent stores shut down .
they couldn ’ t compete with the bigger , more modern stores .
in berlin , at the same time the 30 independent booksellers folded , big chains with over 30,000 square meters of sales space -lrb- 322,900 square feet -rrb- expanded their presence in the city .
and the mega-bookstores aren ’ t done taking over germany ’ s capital .
thomas nitz , manager of hugendubel , says the city ’ s book demand is not quite " satiated " .
there ’ s still room for growth , he told " buchreport " .
a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .
the bigger the store , the bigger the price reductions .
smaller stores can ’ t afford to offer the price cuts and rebates the larger chains offer .
as a result , customers empty the shelves of big stores first , and the books in the smaller ones gather dust .
in germany , the actual number of book stores has not changed dramatically over the last several years .
the association of german publishers and booksellers listed 4,661 stores for 2002 .
that ’ s only nine fewer than in 1997 .
but the numbers are deceptive .
for every small store that closes , a bigger chain moves in .
and the percentage of the market is increasing for the larger chains while it decreases for the independent stores .
the 10 biggest bookstores in germany accounted for 1.2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- of the 5.44 million euro -lrb- $ 5.43 million -rrb- in overall book sales for 2001 .

krefeld , a mid-size western german city in north rhine-westphalia , is a good example of this trend .
when two of germany ’ s biggest chains moved in , seven of the city ’ s traditional independent stores shut down .
they couldn ’ t compete with the bigger , more modern stores .
in berlin , at the same time the 30 independent booksellers folded , big chains with over 30,000 square meters of sales space -lrb- 322,900 square feet -rrb- expanded their presence in the city .
and the mega-bookstores aren ’ t done taking over germany ’ s capital .
thomas nitz , manager of hugendubel , says the city ’ s book demand is not quite " satiated " .
there ’ s still room for growth , he told " buchreport " .
a growing trend the tendency to open chains at the expense of smaller bookstores is not unique to germany .
in england , the nation-wide waterstones has driven out numerous independent sellers , and in the united states , borders and barnes & noble share an ever-growing dominance on the american book market .
the giant stores with their broad selection and modern appearance are attracting more and more customers .
they come for the experience of browsing in a trendy atmosphere , for special events , internet terminals , and a cup of coffee .
and of course they come for the sales .
the bigger the store , the bigger the price reductions .
smaller stores can ’ t afford to offer the price cuts and rebates the larger chains offer .
as a result , customers empty the shelves of big stores first , and the books in the smaller ones gather dust .
in germany , the actual number of book stores has not changed dramatically over the last several years .
the association of german publishers and booksellers listed 4,661 stores for 2002 .
that ’ s only nine fewer than in 1997 .
but the numbers are deceptive .
for every small store that closes , a bigger chain moves in .
and the percentage of the market is increasing for the larger chains while it decreases for the independent stores .
the 10 biggest bookstores in germany accounted for 1.2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- of the 5.44 million euro -lrb- $ 5.43 million -rrb- in overall book sales for 2001 .
the marketing division of the booksellers association could not give exact statistics as to what percent of the market is in the hands of the nation-wide chains , but the spokesperson gertraud majer said she " suspects the chains are taking an ever larger share at the expense of the small stores .

they want to document how climate change has affected their size and shape . a flea market is an unusual place for a geologist to begin working on a research project on mountain glaciers .
but for a munich-based team of geological climatologists , this is the perfect starting point .
three years ago the german team of scientists began searching antique stores , flee markets , state archives and university libraries for historic photos and postcards .
they collected 2,500 examples from across europe .
and every illustration depicted the exact same thing : alpine glaciers .
the scientists , working together with greenpeace , are using the historic pictures as proof of climate warming in europe .
by comparing the old photos with pictures taken from today , the munich society for environmental research can show how rapidly the glaciers have melted over the course of years .
the data they gain will be used by climatologists as proof of global warming .
taking the global temperature according to the world glacier monitoring organization , glaciers are a " global thermometer " and reflect the world ’ s rising temperature .
" they are the most visible sign of climate change , " says the munich team ’ s web site .
from the middle of the 19th century to about 1975 , the giant ice fields shrank about one-third in area and lost about half of their volume .
in the last 25 years , they have melted even faster , losing an additional 20 to 30 percent of their water content .
the disappearance of the alpine glaciers effects more than just the mountain eco-system .
europe ’ s biggest rivers , the rhine , rhone and po , spring forth from the glaciers and depend on their year-round water supply .
if the glaciers dry up , entire water reservoirs will be endangered , warn the munich researchers .
plus , the melting ice fields loosen up boulders and lead to mountainside erosion and eventually avalanches .
for the experts meeting in johannesburg at the end of august for the u.n. climate summit , the shrinking mountain lakes are a key indicator of global warming and a cause for world-wide concern , says the society for environmental research in munich .
relocating historical sites but documenting the glacial melt is not an easy task .
the scientists have to find the exact location depicted in the historical photos and the position from which the picture was taken .
to do so , the geologists spent months hiking through the alps , speaking with mountain guides and local climbers .
they studied elevation maps , examined satellite images , and measured paths and meadows .
equipped with the most modern surveying technology such as uv- gauges on the one hand and historic hiking maps on the other , the team was finally able to locate the 60 largest alpine glaciers shown in the postcards .
" we had to do a lot of climbing and clambering , " the team ’ s project leader , wolfgang zängl , told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
many of the key landscape markers shown in the photos , such as rock formations and boulders , are covered in grass and trees , explains team member sylvia hamberger .
" the old hiking paths and glacier terraces have disappeared " making orientation difficult in the mountain landscape , she says .
in the end , though , the team was able to photograph each one of the glaciers and compare the size and shape of today ’ s frozen lakes to those in the historical photos .
the results of their research and the glacial photo documentation have been published on the internet under the web site www.gletscherarchiv.de.
looking at the pictures , the differences between then and now are obvious .

people eked out an existence there , based on trapping and eating sea birds , until 1930 .
now the national trust for scotland - which owns the islands 45 miles west of the outer hebrides - says it will need £ 5m to secure their future .
it will launch the appeal next year , when st kilda is listed for the second time as a world heritage site , making it a member of an elite club that also includes the taj mahal and mount athos in greece . "
grass that shone , bright green in contrast to the different greys of the sea and the sky " i travelled out to gain a unique glimpse of the " islands at the edge of the world " .
i travelled with murdo macdonald , master of the converted fisheries research vessel the mv cuma , who has been sailing the waters round the outer hebrides - off the west coast of scotland - for about 30 years .
he looks the part , with his craggy , red face , and neatly trimmed beard .
he 's not a man given to wild exaggeration .
so when he said the sea was a little bit " rocky and roll-y " , i paid attention .
it turned out he meant that it was blowing a force eight gale .
and , as more and more of his passengers - including me - started turning green , murdo decided we should abandon our first attempt to make it to st kilda .
we took refuge in a sea loch , in the shelter of the island of scarp , and set off again the next morning .
amid the rather forced laughter over breakfast , there was the distinctly audible crackle of foil , as people pushed sea sickness pills from their packaging .
and there was much repetition of the advice that - if feeling queasy - you should stare at a point on the horizon .
but there was nothing to stare at .
for miles ... for hours ... nothing to stare at .
boil puffins then suddenly , out of the high mist and low cloud ahead , the sheer cliffs of boreray ... the first of the islands of the st kilda archipelago .
alongside it , stac an armin - a massive wedge of rock which looks as though it has been dumped down in the sea , and which is home to thousands of birds .
the st kildans used to eat them , boil puffins in their porridge to give it flavour , burn oil from the fulmars crop in their lamps , and sell feathers to the mainland .
not much longer , and we were anchoring in village bay , just off the main island of hirte , which is what most people mean when they talk about st kilda .
grass that shone , bright green in contrast to the different greys of the sea and the sky .
more steep cliffs .
more sea birds .
black and brown sheep - the unique soay breed - clambering on slopes that seemed practically vertical .
and signs of human habitation , too .
the street of houses where the people lived until they abandoned the island .
and the radar tracking station that is now based there , complete with utilitarian temporary buildings , and its ugly power station .
the people that ran it used to call themselves the kilda generating board , or kgb .
so , naturally , the open area next door is called red square .
and you get the sense that jokes like that , which are repeated so often they either get funnier and funnier , or make you want to kill someone , have been an important part of life on the island recently .
belisha beacons after the ministry of defence put in a road up the highest hill , so engineers could construct masts and antennae , some joker decided to paint a black and white pedestrian crossing across the road , just below the summit .
it 's still there , though the belisha beacons have gone .
living in a tiny community on an island that is so remote its original inhabitants asked to be moved must do strange things to you .
and strange things seem to happen in st kilda .
like the time a crate of food being air-dropped for the base burst open , sending a frozen chicken crashing through the windscreen of a waiting vehicle .
it dislocated the driver 's shoulder - the story goes - and he had to be discharged from the army .
but no one can quite remember exactly how they explained that on the paperwork .
during the voyage across , murdo told me st kilda was an almost mystical place , which keeps drawing him back .
he 'd be happy to go there every day , he said .
and st kilda has been exercising that power over visitors since the first cruise ships started calling in the 1830s .
to begin with , the visits were not a success .
one group brought a brass band , which terrified the islanders and their stock .
the first steam yachts caused alarm too , as the st kildans assumed they must be on fire .
later , islanders came to rely on selling souvenirs to tourists .
however , one woman is recorded as complaining that she had sold a whole winter 's-worth of tweed production to a visitor for an orange .
light labour she had never seen the fruit before and kept it - until it became so mouldy she had to throw it away .
in 1838 , a writer described st kilda as a utopia , whose inhabitants enjoyed late slumber and light labour .
i 'm not sure that can have been true , even then .
so , back to my conversation with murdo on the cuma .
would he want to live on the islands ?
deserted houses he was quite definite .
no , he would not .
thanks very much , but no thanks .
and after a century of organised contact with the outside world , the last 36 st kildans petitioned the government to send a steamer , because they could see no future for themselves on their island home .
the last man to board the harebell , on 29 august 1930 , described walking down the village high street , looking into the deserted houses .
it was , he said , like staring into an empty grave .
one family left a bible behind .
it was open at the book of exodus .

grass that shone , bright green in contrast to the different greys of the sea and the sky i travelled out to gain a unique glimpse of the " islands at the edge of the world " .
i travelled with murdo macdonald , master of the converted fisheries research vessel the mv cuma , who has been sailing the waters round the outer hebrides - off the west coast of scotland - for about 30 years .
he looks the part , with his craggy , red face , and neatly trimmed beard .
he 's not a man given to wild exaggeration .
so when he said the sea was a little bit " rocky and roll-y " , i paid attention .
it turned out he meant that it was blowing a force eight gale .
and , as more and more of his passengers - including me - started turning green , murdo decided we should abandon our first attempt to make it to st kilda .
murdo macdonald : force eight gale we took refuge in a sea loch , in the shelter of the island of scarp , and set off again the next morning .
amid the rather forced laughter over breakfast , there was the distinctly audible crackle of foil , as people pushed sea sickness pills from their packaging .
and there was much repetition of the advice that - if feeling queasy - you should stare at a point on the horizon .
but there was nothing to stare at .
for miles ... for hours ... nothing to stare at .
boil puffins then suddenly , out of the high mist and low cloud ahead , the sheer cliffs of boreray ... the first of the islands of the st kilda archipelago .
alongside it , stac an armin - a massive wedge of rock which looks as though it has been dumped down in the sea , and which is home to thousands of birds .
the st kildans used to eat them , boil puffins in their porridge to give it flavour , burn oil from the fulmars crop in their lamps , and sell feathers to the mainland .
not much longer , and we were anchoring in village bay , just off the main island of hirte , which is what most people mean when they talk about st kilda .
grass that shone , bright green in contrast to the different greys of the sea and the sky .
more steep cliffs .
more sea birds .
black and brown sheep - the unique soay breed - clambering on slopes that seemed practically vertical .
huw williams on the mv cuma and signs of human habitation , too .
the street of houses where the people lived until they abandoned the island .
and the radar tracking station that is now based there , complete with utilitarian temporary buildings , and its ugly power station .
the people that ran it used to call themselves the kilda generating board , or kgb .
so , naturally , the open area next door is called red square .
and you get the sense that jokes like that , which are repeated so often they either get funnier and funnier , or make you want to kill someone , have been an important part of life on the island recently .
belisha beacons after the ministry of defence put in a road up the highest hill , so engineers could construct masts and antennae , some joker decided to paint a black and white pedestrian crossing across the road , just below the summit .
it 's still there , though the belisha beacons have gone .
living in a tiny community on an island that is so remote its original inhabitants asked to be moved must do strange things to you .
and strange things seem to happen in st kilda .
like the time a crate of food being air-dropped for the base burst open , sending a frozen chicken crashing through the windscreen of a waiting vehicle .
it dislocated the driver 's shoulder - the story goes - and he had to be discharged from the army .
but no one can quite remember exactly how they explained that on the paperwork .
arriving in st kilda during the voyage across , murdo told me st kilda was an almost mystical place , which keeps drawing him back .
he 'd be happy to go there every day , he said .
and st kilda has been exercising that power over visitors since the first cruise ships started calling in the 1830s .
to begin with , the visits were not a success .
one group brought a brass band , which terrified the islanders and their stock .
the first steam yachts caused alarm too , as the st kildans assumed they must be on fire .
later , islanders came to rely on selling souvenirs to tourists .
however , one woman is recorded as complaining that she had sold a whole winter 's-worth of tweed production to a visitor for an orange .
light labour she had never seen the fruit before and kept it - until it became so mouldy she had to throw it away .
in 1838 , a writer described st kilda as a utopia , whose inhabitants enjoyed late slumber and light labour .
i 'm not sure that can have been true , even then .
so , back to my conversation with murdo on the cuma .
would he want to live on the islands ?
deserted houses he was quite definite .
no , he would not .
thanks very much , but no thanks .
and after a century of organised contact with the outside world , the last 36 st kildans petitioned the government to send a steamer , because they could see no future for themselves on their island home .
the last man to board the harebell , on 29 august 1930 , described walking down the village high street , looking into the deserted houses .
it was , he said , like staring into an empty grave .
one family left a bible behind .
it was open at the book of exodus .
