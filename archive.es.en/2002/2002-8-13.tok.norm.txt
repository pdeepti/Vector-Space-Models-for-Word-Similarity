in the past year the city has rushed to preserve the remaining remants of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
almost 41 years after the wall was built and 13 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company , " berlin starting point " told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest for the berlin wall especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometere concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided a people .
all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
the bernauerstrasse , that marks the boundary between the districts , mitte that was formerly the soviet sector and wedding that belonged to the french sector , was a closed guarded border and the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70 metre section of the original wall and a documentation centre on the wall .
similarly not far off , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a look-out tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmacked strip .
peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-metre-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the " topography of terror . "
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of . better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for wall detectives and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .
once a pre-fabricated monitoring tower erected by the allies in the american sector after the erection of the berlin wall , it today houses a museum on the history of the wall and exhibitions on human rights .
the souvenir shop here also sells pieces of the wall , a hot-selling item among tourists .
to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300-metres-long and also a massive open-air art gallery .
after the wall was opened in 1989 , hundreds of artists from all over the world transformed the plain eastern side of the wall into a drawing-board for their art .
the result is a spectacular display of colour and shapes on what was once grey concrete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east side gallery city wakes up to the potential of the wall realising the tourist magnet that the last bits of the wall had become , city authorities last year placed them under the monument protection act and thus took responsibility for their preservation and restoration .
petra rohland , spokeswoman for the senate administration for city development told dw-world that " we ’ re trying to integrate the last remains of the berlin wall in the city profile – as an admonishment as well as proof of a living history .

in the past year the city has rushed to preserve the remaining remants of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
almost 41 years after the wall was built and 13 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company , " berlin starting point " told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest for the berlin wall especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometere concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided a people .
all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
the bernauerstrasse , that marks the boundary between the districts , mitte that was formerly the soviet sector and wedding that belonged to the french sector , was a closed guarded border and the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70 metre section of the original wall and a documentation centre on the wall .
similarly not far off , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a look-out tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmacked strip .
peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-metre-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the " topography of terror . "
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of . better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for wall detectives and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .
once a pre-fabricated monitoring tower erected by the allies in the american sector after the erection of the berlin wall , it today houses a museum on the history of the wall and exhibitions on human rights .
the souvenir shop here also sells pieces of the wall , a hot-selling item among tourists .
to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300-metres-long and also a massive open-air art gallery .
after the wall was opened in 1989 , hundreds of artists from all over the world transformed the plain eastern side of the wall into a drawing-board for their art .
the result is a spectacular display of colour and shapes on what was once grey concrete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east side gallery city wakes up to the potential of the wall realising the tourist magnet that the last bits of the wall had become , city authorities last year placed them under the monument protection act and thus took responsibility for their preservation and restoration .
petra rohland , spokeswoman for the senate administration for city development told dw-world that " we ’ re trying to integrate the last remains of the berlin wall in the city profile – as an admonishment as well as proof of a living history .

in the past year the city has rushed to preserve the remaining remants of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
almost 41 years after the wall was built and 13 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company , " berlin starting point " told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest for the berlin wall especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometere concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided a people .
all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
the bernauerstrasse , that marks the boundary between the districts , mitte that was formerly the soviet sector and wedding that belonged to the french sector , was a closed guarded border and the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70 metre section of the original wall and a documentation centre on the wall .
similarly not far off , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a look-out tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmacked strip .
peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-metre-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the " topography of terror . "
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of . better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for wall detectives and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .
once a pre-fabricated monitoring tower erected by the allies in the american sector after the erection of the berlin wall , it today houses a museum on the history of the wall and exhibitions on human rights .
the souvenir shop here also sells pieces of the wall , a hot-selling item among tourists .
to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300-metres-long and also a massive open-air art gallery .
after the wall was opened in 1989 , hundreds of artists from all over the world transformed the plain eastern side of the wall into a drawing-board for their art .
the result is a spectacular display of colour and shapes on what was once grey concrete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east side gallery city wakes up to the potential of the wall realising the tourist magnet that the last bits of the wall had become , city authorities last year placed them under the monument protection act and thus took responsibility for their preservation and restoration .

" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometere concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided a people .
all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
the bernauerstrasse , that marks the boundary between the districts , mitte that was formerly the soviet sector and wedding that belonged to the french sector , was a closed guarded border and the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70 metre section of the original wall and a documentation centre on the wall .
similarly not far off , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a look-out tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmacked strip .
peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-metre-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the " topography of terror . "
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of . better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for wall detectives and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .
once a pre-fabricated monitoring tower erected by the allies in the american sector after the erection of the berlin wall , it today houses a museum on the history of the wall and exhibitions on human rights .
the souvenir shop here also sells pieces of the wall , a hot-selling item among tourists .
to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300-metres-long and also a massive open-air art gallery .
after the wall was opened in 1989 , hundreds of artists from all over the world transformed the plain eastern side of the wall into a drawing-board for their art .
the result is a spectacular display of colour and shapes on what was once grey concrete .

a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
almost 41 years after the wall was built and 13 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company , " berlin starting point " told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest for the berlin wall especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometere concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided a people .
all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
the bernauerstrasse , that marks the boundary between the districts , mitte that was formerly the soviet sector and wedding that belonged to the french sector , was a closed guarded border and the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70 metre section of the original wall and a documentation centre on the wall .
similarly not far off , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a look-out tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmacked strip .
peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-metre-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the " topography of terror . "
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of . better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for wall detectives and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .
once a pre-fabricated monitoring tower erected by the allies in the american sector after the erection of the berlin wall , it today houses a museum on the history of the wall and exhibitions on human rights .
the souvenir shop here also sells pieces of the wall , a hot-selling item among tourists .
to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300-metres-long and also a massive open-air art gallery .
after the wall was opened in 1989 , hundreds of artists from all over the world transformed the plain eastern side of the wall into a drawing-board for their art .
the result is a spectacular display of colour and shapes on what was once grey concrete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east side gallery city wakes up to the potential of the wall realising the tourist magnet that the last bits of the wall had become , city authorities last year placed them under the monument protection act and thus took responsibility for their preservation and restoration .
petra rohland , spokeswoman for the senate administration for city development told dw-world that " we ’ re trying to integrate the last remains of the berlin wall in the city profile – as an admonishment as well as proof of a living history .

in the past year the city has rushed to preserve the remaining remants of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
almost 41 years after the wall was built and 13 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company , " berlin starting point " told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest for the berlin wall especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometere concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided a people .
all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
the bernauerstrasse , that marks the boundary between the districts , mitte that was formerly the soviet sector and wedding that belonged to the french sector , was a closed guarded border and the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70 metre section of the original wall and a documentation centre on the wall .
similarly not far off , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a look-out tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmacked strip .
peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-metre-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the " topography of terror . "
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of . better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for wall detectives and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .
once a pre-fabricated monitoring tower erected by the allies in the american sector after the erection of the berlin wall , it today houses a museum on the history of the wall and exhibitions on human rights .
the souvenir shop here also sells pieces of the wall , a hot-selling item among tourists .
to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300-metres-long and also a massive open-air art gallery .
after the wall was opened in 1989 , hundreds of artists from all over the world transformed the plain eastern side of the wall into a drawing-board for their art .
the result is a spectacular display of colour and shapes on what was once grey concrete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east side gallery city wakes up to the potential of the wall realising the tourist magnet that the last bits of the wall had become , city authorities last year placed them under the monument protection act and thus took responsibility for their preservation and restoration .
petra rohland , spokeswoman for the senate administration for city development told dw-world that " we ’ re trying to integrate the last remains of the berlin wall in the city profile – as an admonishment as well as proof of a living history .

in the past year the city has rushed to preserve the remaining remants of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
almost 41 years after the wall was built and 13 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company , " berlin starting point " told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest for the berlin wall especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometere concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided a people .
all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
the bernauerstrasse , that marks the boundary between the districts , mitte that was formerly the soviet sector and wedding that belonged to the french sector , was a closed guarded border and the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70 metre section of the original wall and a documentation centre on the wall .
similarly not far off , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a look-out tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmacked strip .
peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-metre-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the " topography of terror . "
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of . better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for wall detectives and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .
once a pre-fabricated monitoring tower erected by the allies in the american sector after the erection of the berlin wall , it today houses a museum on the history of the wall and exhibitions on human rights .
the souvenir shop here also sells pieces of the wall , a hot-selling item among tourists .
to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300-metres-long and also a massive open-air art gallery .
after the wall was opened in 1989 , hundreds of artists from all over the world transformed the plain eastern side of the wall into a drawing-board for their art .
the result is a spectacular display of colour and shapes on what was once grey concrete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east side gallery city wakes up to the potential of the wall realising the tourist magnet that the last bits of the wall had become , city authorities last year placed them under the monument protection act and thus took responsibility for their preservation and restoration .
petra rohland , spokeswoman for the senate administration for city development told dw-world that " we ’ re trying to integrate the last remains of the berlin wall in the city profile – as an admonishment as well as proof of a living history .
she admits that the city 's coffers are empty , so there ca n't be any " luxurious restoration " .
but she says that the interest in the berlin wall world-wide is so overwhelming that " there are always some takers for shouldering the costs " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official guide to berlin 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the set-up is needed to ensure delivery of the government 's long-awaited reform of the csa .
the hold-up means hundreds of thousands of families are suffering because payments are taking too long to work out - and collect .
the system was designed to help speed up the calculation of payments as well as collection times and was due to go into operation in april .
the agency costs £ 290m a year to run technical problems meant a new deadline was set but this too has now passed , and sources say next summer is now looking more likely for the launch .
insiders also told the bbc the project is at least £ 50m over budget - a quarter of the £ 200m total .
the contract to provide the new technology was awarded to the texas-based company eds , under a private finance initiative -lrb- pfi -rrb- .
the bbc 's business correspondent rebecca pike says the terms of the contract mean it is not clear who pays for the budget overspend .
critics say it could end up being the taxpayer , thereby undermining one of the main points of pfi - that the risk of things going wrong is transferred to the private sector .
compensation the revelations come less than a month after calls were made to disband the agency when it emerged that more than £ 2bn owed by absent parents towards their children 's upbringing had been written off .
the csa , which costs about £ 290m a year to run , has been dogged by controversy during its nine-year history .
mistakes have led to millions of pounds in compensation payments to disgruntled parents , wrongly asked to pay either too much or at all .
established to settle maintenance for children of separated parents , it aims to ensure that absent parents are held financially responsible for their children .
it replaced the court system which was finding problems dealing with the increasing amount of cases it was facing .
but the complicated formula needed to work out payments has led to mistakes and delay , causing much misery and anger .
in some cases , absent parents have been overcharged , but in others - such as that of self-employed people - as many as 80 % have avoided paying all the money they should because of loopholes in the system . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's rebecca pike " the new computer is key to the agency 's reform " see also : 06 aug 02 -pipe- politics £ 2bn owed by parents written off 20 mar 02 -pipe- politics child support agency reforms delayed 17 oct 01 -pipe- wales csa pays back ' wrong ' dad 03 jul 01 -pipe- uk child support complaints up by a third internet links : child support agency the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories now : no rush to war , says blair 10,000 chased for congestion fine omagh detectives make arrest beckham forgives ferguson waiter jailed for underage sex britons ' baffled over euro rate ' sleepy drivers who kill face jail man charged after boy stabbed links to more uk stories are at the foot of the page .

" in the near future , the peruvian people will realise that the criminal charges i face are misplaced , " he told the mainichi shimbun .
" in that case , i would like to return and run for election . "
i am planning for the day in the future when i can return alberto fujimori mr fujimori fled almost three years ago amid a corruption scandal involving his former intelligence chief , vladimiro montesinos , which brought down his 10-year authoritarian government .
the peruvian authorities have repeatedly asked tokyo to send him back to face charges of alleged human rights violations and embezzlement .
but japan refuses to extradite mr fujimori because he holds japanese citizenship .
planning to return there has been mounting speculation in recent months that mr fujimori was planning to return to peruvian politics .
japan refuses to extradite mr fujimori in july carlos raffo , an independent journalist who worked as a fujimori image consultant , said he had his sights firmly fixed on running in peru 's 2006 presidential elections .
with the economy increasingly troubled , support for current the president , alejandro toledo , is low .
a recent poll suggested mr fujimori would get 14 % of the vote - second only to another former president , alan garcia , who polled nearly 40 % .
mr garcia fled peru in 1992 to avoid being arrested by mr fujimori 's soldiers on embezzlement charges .
he returned in 2001 and contested the presidential run-off against mr toledo following mr fujimori 's departure .
massacres alberto fujimori admitted to the newspaper that if he went back to peru at the moment , he would probably be arrested .
" i do n't want to take that risk , " he said .
" but i am planning for the day in the future when i can return , " he told the paper .
the peruvian government wants mr fujimori - who ruled the country from 1990 to 2000 - to face charges linked to two notorious massacres by an army death squad , as well as separate charges of corruption and embezzlement .
fujimori has been implicated in massacres " i did not sanction this operation and there is no evidence to justify my arrest , " mr fujimori is quoted as saying .
the former president has also been implicated in the alleged forced sterilisation of women as part of a family planning scheme during the time he was in power .
mr fujimori denied any wrongdoing and said the women had given prior consent , but critics claim they were " tricked , obligated or intimidated " into having the surgery as a form of birth control .
but so far japan has refused to hand mr fujimori over to peru because of japanese extradition laws .
shortly after his arrival in tokyo , mr fujimori was recognised as a japanese national on the grounds that his parents were japanese immigrants to peru .
but clear intentions of running for public office in another country could jeopardise his status as a japanese citizen , as it would go against the country 's nationality law .

the sonic flashlight developed by researchers at carnegie mellon university in the us combines various technologies to effectively gives the user x-ray vision .
the device looks like a small windowpane attached to a ray gun which produces a live ultrasound scan when placed against a patient 's body .
researchers say the device could be used to make many surgical and diagnostic procedures such as brain surgery much safer .
surgical insight doctors already use ultrasound devices to guide them in performing surgery .
but it can be tricky because the doctor has to look away from the patient and into a monitor .
in any case , most of the equipment is expensive and cumbersome .
" when you are guiding procedures , like sticking needles into people , you do n't want to be looking away from your work area , " researcher damion shelton told the bbc programme go digital .

the sonic flashlight developed by researchers at carnegie mellon university in the us combines various technologies to effectively gives the user x-ray vision .

this could be your chance , as open season is declared on other people 's abandoned dreams of internet glory .
if you ever wanted a guide to the folly of many people 's dot.com dreams then look no further than the deleted domains website .
this site lets you search through the millions of domain names that people have abandoned because they have now realised that there is no chance it will make their fortune .
at the time of writing deleted domains had on file 16,139,249 deleted domain names .
some deleted domains e-mitting.com doesgodloveme.com a-diamond-says-i-do.com wwqgoogle.com car-px.com thatadvert.com gprsmovies.com marmaladebadger.com euphemism.com the fees for registering a name vary wildly but even if you assume a low figure of $ 10 per domain that is an enormous amount of money that has been spent on something that is now demonstrably worthless .
the lists have grown quickly of late because the domain name buying craze was at its most frenzied a little over two years ago .
typical domain name purchase periods are two years , to which you have to add on a month or so for it to be put on hold and then finally released back into the ever deepening pool of names that suddenly nobody wants .
this only happens with .com , .net and .org names .
many others have very different policies and some , such as .uk , rarely release unwanted names .
genius or idiocy anyone of a generous nature wading through the lists of deleted names , some of which are frankly bizarre , might take it as a celebration of human hope and a testimony to the sunny optimism that infected the dot.com boom .
on the other hand perhaps it a demonstration of human idiocy .
browsing the lists gives a real glimpse into how unrealistic some dot.com dreams were .
for instance , someone registered rferfffffffffffffffffffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeeee.com.
why , i do not know .
i 'm prepared to admit that there are byways of human experience that i 'll never walk down , but i simply can not think why anyone would want that domain .
or worldoftowels.com or bunneeeeee.com.
curiously , there is no sign of bunneeeee.com -lrb- with five ' es ' instead of six -rrb- .
perhaps the owner is holding on to it , just in case .
who 's big cheese this month ?
then there are all the people that registered domains featuring the phrase " dotcom " such as barrytaylordotcom.com.
perhaps it has now been abandoned because mr taylor got sick of trying to explain it to people on the phone .
the same could be true of minerals-minerals-minerals-minerals-minerals-minerals-minerals.com 's owner who was forever hearing people say : " how many minerals was that ? " every time they passed it on .
there are also many examples of people who obviously thought they were on to a big trend and snapped up many variations on a single theme .
at last count i could find eight variations on the " cheese of the month club " , most of which lapsed about the same time , suggesting they were bought as a block .
like a lot of people i am partial to cheese , often more than once a month , but also like most people i 'm never going to join a club to celebrate my affection for it .
optimism clearly knows no international boundaries either because it is not just dot.com domains that people were looking to make a fortune with .
nigel roberts , managing director of the channel islands ' registry said a japanese man registered more than 1,000 domains that ended " .gg " , the islands ' suffix .
each one was the name of a city of town in japan .
mr roberts speculates that " gg " sounds like a japanese word but as none of the domains has been renewed then it 's hard to find out what use they might have been put to .
negligence other domains make it to the deleted list by accident , because negligent owners have forgotten about their site or the admin e-mail address has changed .
these lapsed but once-working names are valuable property .
" people are grabbing these domains that expire because they have a ready stream of visitors , " said ken sorrie , founder and managing director of registrar internetters .
while it is hard to build traffic to a site from zero , it becomes a lot easier if you can just take over someone else 's location .
but as the fever for hot domain names continues unabated , some dot.com dreams are taking a long time to die .
people are grabbing these domains that expire because they have a ready stream of visitors ken sorrie there are many sites on the web , such as ebay and usenet , where people offer domains for sale .
some of the asking prices are a little unrealistic .
how much would you pay for africanmomma.com ?
a few pence only i would wager , yet the owner of it wants $ 1 million .
the chances are slim given that foxymomma.com and 65 other similar ones have been deleted .
truth be told the chances are slim for almost anyone who owns a domain and thinks they can make a mint out of it .
after all dotmillionaires.com and domainnamegold.com were deleted a long time ago .
any bright ideas for what to do with a dead domain name ?
let us know using the form below .
besides being the company which is selling all these deleted domain names , the only way i can see of making money from them , is to publish a book on 101 uses for a dead domain name .
dave s , uk thanks for the tip-off .
i 've been looking for new addresses to expand my soccer prediction site , and had almost given up , but now i have the opportunity to add " winners hits " -lrb- dotcom -rrb- .
hmmm ... on second thoughts maybe i 'll give that one a miss .
stewart , uk is there a " www.southseabubble.com " ? ? ? ? ?
simon , uk it may well be worth finding a name that flopped so bad , that it received press .
nothing better than using a brand name that is already familiar .
it could work like skoda did for vw , turning an old joked brand into a sales winner .
adam rogers , uk if you put them in the oven and warm them up , you can mould them into ashtrays .
my dad ties them to bits of string and uses them as bird-scarers in the garden .
frances morgan , uk i suggest every person now alive should be assigned a once registered name -lrb- pregnant women in last trimester get 2 ! -rrb-
this way each person , however poor or remote from computer technology , can be said to participate in the " revolution " .
mary byrkit , us a " whose line is it anyway " skit , requiring the participants to have a conversation using nothing but dot.com detritus .
mark hucke , new zealand using a domain name that has failed is to me like taking a dead soldier 's weapon .
it obviously did n't work for him , so why would it work for you ?
jason , canada i 'm glad that a lot of cybersitters have lost out .
a band i was in a while ago were asked for $ 2000 for the .com name .
to put it bluntly the owner received a massive amount of spam from us just as a little payback .
lees , uk at last www.thehypeisover.com : - -rrb- nigel martin , gb i 've just run up a bill of £ 80 registering the domains listed on this site ...
amit , uk i could n't find any appropriate domain names to register two years ago , so i thought i 'd buy " allthegooddomainnameshavegone.com " .
it had gone .

alexandra was constructed under apartheid as a " dormitory town " to provide a labour pool for the white city of johannesburg .
under the national party 's influx control legislation , black residents of alexandra would work as cooks , cleaners , domestic workers and gardeners for white johannesburg by day , and return to the townships by night .
today , the township , initially meant for a population of 75,000 , now an estimated 350,000 , is one of the most densely populated and economically depressed places in the country .
homes are being marked with an " x " for demolition most of its residents are unemployed and poor .
local government services such as water , sanitation and electricity are not functioning properly .
yet this need not be the case , says mike maile , who is one of the driving forces behind the government-spearheaded alexandra renewal project -lrb- arp -rrb- .
according to mr maile , alexandra 's close proximity to sandton , as well as the industrial area of wynberg , should make it perfectly placed from an employment point of view .
yet the township has a 60 % unemployment rate .
upgrade oiled by us $ 130m budget over the next seven years , the project 's aim is " to upgrade living conditions and human development within alexandra " .

at the side of the house , a separate vegetable garden grows " morogo " -lrb- wild spinach -rrb- , carrots and onions .

earlier this year , the pensioner was the winner in a gardening competition held by the arp for river park residents .
today , virtually every house in the area has at least one tree , or a lawn .
the project 's organisers also plan to clean up surrounding parks and rivers to create recreational spaces for alexandra residents .
resettlement the renewal plan also aims to reduce alexandra 's population density .

residents try to keep their head above water every year , the river floods its banks , causing the people who lived in shacks alongside the river to lose their property , and in many cases , their lives .
the arp began moving people off the banks of the river last year , citing the hazards of a flood plain .
they were resettled in other townships , like diepsloot .
but those residents earmarked for relocation would not go willingly - the city council had to forcibly remove them .
the ensuing mayhem opened the city council to accusations that it was using apartheid-era tactics to remove people from their homes .
maile says there have been noticeable benefits from the relocations .
since many of the shacks were removed , the rate of car hijacking in the area has dropped dramatically .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- uk-libya : should relations be restored ?

the first british minister to visit libya in almost 20 years has held talks with long-serving leader colonel muammar gaddafi .
foreign office minister mike o 'brien 's three-day visit is aimed at securing colonel gaddafi 's support for the international war on terror and opposition to the use of weapons of mass destruction .
the two countries also have an economic interest in boosting relations after years of tension .
the us has described libya as being part of an " axis of evil " .
but mr o 'brien said libya had shown its desire to move from " pariah " to a state complying with international law by handing over the lockerbie bomb suspects .
do you think that relations should be restored between the two countries ?
has libya done enough to be accepted back into the international community ?
who has more to gain by improving relations ?
this talking point has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
i think it is time to let bygones be bygones between the uk and libya .
it seems obvious to me that gaddafi has changed , as he is the only arab leader to publicly say that israel should have a spot on the arab league summit .
he wants the region to have peace , and -lrb- most importantly for the yanks -rrb- recognises israel 's right to exist .
surely that is a good thing for all concerned ?
booker t. huffman , england , uk " after thirty-three years in power he is a wily bird to deal with " john martin nichols , france i am surprised by some contributors who rather naively assume that the libyan leader may be manipulated to western advantage .
after thirty-three years in power he is a wily bird to deal with , always fervent in his faith , but there is of course no reason now not to attempt to set up equitable discussions on a number of wide ranging topics !
john martin nichols , france this government has negotiated with ni terrorist groups so i think it 's about time it started talking to libya , the former allies of the republican movement .
dave , england it is ironic that at the same time as the us and uk are considering bombing iraq , that they are also trying to renew their relationship with a man described in the past as a monster and previously the victim of us bombing .
the most pressing reason that i can see for restoring relations with gaddafi is firstly both america and britain need to widen the base of their trading partners to help sagging economies , and second , if they ca n't use saudi arabia as a jumping off point in the mid-east , gaddafi is just eccentric enough to let them use libya - for a price , of course !
i do n't see any improvement in human rights in libya so there has to be an ulterior motive .
susan , usa / uk " no progress can be made between the western and middle east nations by living in the past " gerrard fagbemi , london , uk yes , britain should restore relations with libya .
no progress can be made between the western and middle east nations by living in the past - just look at the israeli and palestinian conflict , not to mention america 's determination to attack iraq regardless of serious international opposition .
gerrard fagbemi , london , uk sure give him a chance .
what exactly does having relations mean ?
that we trade with them ?
that we discuss human rights issues , etc ?
what harm can it do ?
the american embargo on cuba has done no good for the cuban people and that castro is still in power there .
maybe things would be better for the cubans if americans could freely trade and interact with them .
so , libya abuses human rights , so do many other countries , including china and we have relations with them .
i do n't believe in the death penalty and i live in a state where it 's illegal , but i trade with other states that have it .
how would the us feel if japan , latin america , and europe stopped trading with us because we have the death penalty ?
if the libyan government supports terrorism then we should punish those in power not the people .
ken , usa i am sure that money is involved with the soft sell on relaxation of policies on libya .
we must remember it was n't so long ago that gaddafi was being named as an exporter of terrorism etc .
money talks and morality walks .
mike , usa why not ask whether it is in the interest of my country , libya , to fully engage with an imperialist power that time and again has tried to undermine the very real achievements of the libyan revolution ?
from support for the murderous us bombing in 1986 to the attempted assassination of gaddafi , the uk has time and time again attempted to terrorise my people into renouncing the very political and economic system that has brought them success .
although we have done stupid and immoral things in the past -lrb- such as support idi amin and the ruf in sierra leone -rrb- , we have also helped set an example in the fields of democracy , human rights and true socialist development .
essi al-hamdi , usa / libya " the british government is a fool " jake , virginia , united states the british government is a fool if they think gaddafi is now their friend .
this man has not changed , only he was put in his place when bombed by the us in the 80s .
jake , virginia , united states the only reason diplomatic relations were broken by the uk is because the us told it to .
there is still no proof that libya was involved in the pan am bombing .
this would be a great opportunity to make the world a safer place as long as dubya doesnt do anything stupid like make an " axis of evil " speech again ruining any good work done by the rest of the world. vish , uk by all means , give the libyans a chance to join the world community .
but keep sight of the facts that their regime is not democratic nor can a leopard change its spots .
bob , south korea " he is on his knees begging to remain president " muhammad zagoozi , libya the libyan dictator must not be given a chance to apologise or compensate .
he must be removed from power because he has persecuted his own people and now he is on his knees begging to remain president .
he must be removed , even before saddam .
muhammad zagoozi , libya great to see all the warmongers once again wanting yet more death and destruction , safe from their living rooms and armchairs .
if you really desperately want war so much then go sign up for the army and volunteer to be sent onto the front line , on foot .
then see how great an idea it is .
anon , uk it is the usual hypocrisy of western countries to label someone a terrorist and then declare them a friend when it suits them .
latha , india with the threat of war between the us and iraq ever present we should proceed cautiously into libya .
gaddafi 's motives are governed by the perceived outcome of such a conflict .
he will be looking for our support to strengthen his position .
we are right to engage libya at this time but we must be sure that we are not cutting a rod for our own backs .
ian mckenzie , scotland does this sudden new friendship with libya have anything to do with the gas pipeline they are planning to build across the mediterranean ?
clearly my car is n't the only thing driven by oil .
james , uk " every ostracised nation has the right to return to the fold " xiaole bai , china the action taken by the british government with regard to the gaddafi regime is mainly driven by the potential benefit to britain itself .
although i believe every ostracised nation has the right to return to the fold of the international community , this nation should make its choice between good and evil .
xiaole bai , china gaddafi 's numerous mistakes and victories are a result of his fervent belief in his religion , in his politics and in his country .
the question is whether the present day shallow and image-motivated politicians of europe can handle his zeal .
nick , amsterdam , the netherlands i think that it 's time for the world to accept libya back into the international arena .
having worked in libya for more than five years it seems that people enjoy a very high standing of living and are by and large friendly people living in a very polite and secure society .
paulo conti , italy " both libya and the major european countries will have much to gain from improved relations " aniket erande , uk / india i am very happy to note that britain has taken positive steps to improve relations with libya .
having spent a better part of my childhood there , i am naturally biased in favour of the country .
despite the regime 's nebulous track record , in my opinion libya will be a far more reliable ally of europe than perhaps the more capricious states of the middle east .
given its proximity to europe and historical european influence , both libya and the major european countries will have much to gain from improved relations .
aniket erande , uk / india if it can be clearly determined that this government is absolutely out of the business of terrorism , then i think it is right to move towards normalisation of relations .
joseph , new england , usa no , i think this would send the wrong message .
the fact that he 's still there after twenty years is kind of a sad commentary in itself .
tom , usa gaddafi has abandoned international terrorism but still oppresses his own people .
if closer relations with libya will result in pressure being applied on the libyan leader to improve human rights and end corruption then it 's welcome .
otherwise it just vindicates all those who believe the usa and uk support dictators if they abide by their terms mansour ben salim , uk a challenge to mansour ben salim , u.k. i just want you to know that that guy you consider a villain has invested his power , money to mention but a few , to his people .
they like him that 's why he is there up to now .
if you do right to your people they will learn to endure you even though your rule is not democratic .
have consideration for your people then let others come next , and that 's what he stands for .
we hope that western countries are more friend than a foe .
libya stands for achievement - that 's why it 's remained isolated but stable .
regie , usa yes , i think libya does deserve another chance .
one of the best ways to fight terrorism is to show these rogue countries that if they choose to improve the lives of their people and act like a responsible country , the benefits far outweigh the negative aspects that come with being labelled a nation of repression and terrorism .
chad o 'dell , usa " what is happening now is very magnanimous of the libyan regime " alan salisbury , england libya has always been an easy target for the us .
i had just left libya when president reagan chose to bomb tripoli in retaliation for the killing of us troops in germany .
a subsequent investigation showed it was an entirely different group , not connected with libya , which had carried out the atrocity .
col gaddafi lost a daughter in that raid .
i can understand the relatives of the victims of the pan am flight having to find somebody to blame but the lockerbie trial was badly flawed and i will never believe that the libyan government was responsible .
i feel that what is happening now is very magnanimous of the libyan regime and i very much hope we can build upon this new initiative .
alan salisbury , england people who say that it is wrong to try to bring libya into the global community ought to check their homes carefully for japanese goods -lrb- second world war atrocities -rrb- ; german goods -lrb- the blitz -rrb- ; us goods -lrb- the war of independence -rrb- ; i could go on .
there has to come a time when a line is drawn under events , however painful that might be .
gaddafi the friend is easier to control that gaddafi the fiend .
philip , england " this is the wrong time to be currying favour with veteran sponsors of terrorism " david , usa / uk this is precisely the wrong time to be currying favour with veteran sponsors of terrorism like gaddafi .
there is a new world order now , as saddam is about to find out .
gaddafi should be next .
david , usa / uk i think that gaddafi has finally learned how to behave .
he has suffered nothing but rebuffs over the last 20 years , from the humiliation of his army in chad , to the punitive us air raids back in the 1980s .
i think he will now be just like any other tinpot dictator , happy to stay within his own borders and oppress his own .
since most of the world is ruled by dictators , there is no more point in singling him out anymore .
tom byrne , usa as churchill once said : " it is better to jaw-jaw , than to war-war . "
david gatenby , germany as soon as libya apologises and submits for trial -lrb- as it did with lockerbie -rrb- the murderers of wpc yvonne fletcher , then britain may start to think about normal relations .
not until then , however .
tim , geneva , switzerland it is a great and important step that has been taken by britain .
i am certain that all libyans will recognise this .
further steps should be achieved to make the relations between the two countries more solid and valid .
abdelbaset elyagoubi , canada every country has breached international law or human rights at some time or another , including the uk .
some of our partners and allies , including some commonwealth members still continue to do so today .
if libya really has changed , then to continue to ostracise it would be hypocritical .
mm zaman , uk / us " now is the time to leave the past behind " ahmed bishari , libya libya and the uk both have long term mutual interests .
now is the time to leave the past behind and look towards the future .
i sincerely hope that both countries can overcome their differences and work for the common good of their people .
libya needs the uk just as much as the uk needs libya .
ahmed bishari , libya i recently worked in libya for over two years .
everyone has a good basic standard of living .
colonel gaddafi may have done some stupid things in his younger days , but he certainly should be readmitted into the world community !
the warm and friendly people of his country deserve to benefit from this .
david worsley , norway as a brit i am very disappointed that our government is taking this action .
gaddafi 's regime has been widely linked to the murder of friends of mine in the pan am terrorist attack .
he has funded terrorism and publicly supported terrorist groups .
are we about to make the mistake neville chamberlain made with adolf hitler ?
paul , usa / uk it seems like gaddafi has been trying to make himself appear like the leader of a civilised country .
i do n't know if this is just spin for the masses , but from where i sit it looks like the man is trying to shed himself of the terrorist supporter image .
i like what i see .
curtis tindell , fort worth , usa " libya could potentially be a powerful force for good " stuart , uk though the libyan regime has many faults , their record on human rights is nowhere near as bad as that of our so-called friends in the gulf like kuwait or saudi arabia .
nor is there any evidence of recent state involvement in terrorist activities .
libya could potentially be a powerful force for good , not just in the middle east but in several of the african hotspots .
we should not let the american longing for vengeance on a country which has often thumbed its nose at the west prevent us from developing such a potentially useful ally .
stuart , uk i think it 's time to give libya a chance .
the country may have been responsible for terrorist activities in the past , but it would be foolish to permanently put a country out to pasture because of it .
libya has paid a price for terror before and has been relatively quiet since then .
i think it 's time countries like great britain and the united states , at the very least , see what libya has to offer .
dave s , usa all too often it seems countries are ostracised for years by the international community for isolated incidents , or actions perpetrated by a few leaders .
for the world to reach some kind of harmony , everyone must be given some chance at repentance and re-acceptance back into the international community .
recent world events have shown that the alternative is bloodshed and chaos .
jim , uk colonel gaddafi has been a key player in middle east affairs ever since he took power in libya .
securing his support , irrespective of the " axis of evil " tag , would be crucial in the war against international terrorism .
we certainly have more to gain by improving relations , and restoring relations would encourage libya to do more towards being accepted back into the international community .
an opportunity that should not be missed .
graham rodhouse , the netherlands .

nick , amsterdam , the netherlands i think that it 's time for the world to accept libya back into the international arena .
having worked in libya for more than five years it seems that people enjoy a very high standing of living and are by and large friendly people living in a very polite and secure society .
paulo conti , italy both libya and the major european countries will have much to gain from improved relations aniket erande , uk / india i am very happy to note that britain has taken positive steps to improve relations with libya .
having spent a better part of my childhood there , i am naturally biased in favour of the country .
despite the regime 's nebulous track record , in my opinion libya will be a far more reliable ally of europe than perhaps the more capricious states of the middle east .
given its proximity to europe and historical european influence , both libya and the major european countries will have much to gain from improved relations .
aniket erande , uk / india if it can be clearly determined that this government is absolutely out of the business of terrorism , then i think it is right to move towards normalisation of relations .
joseph , new england , usa no , i think this would send the wrong message .
the fact that he 's still there after twenty years is kind of a sad commentary in itself .
tom , usa gaddafi has abandoned international terrorism but still oppresses his own people .
if closer relations with libya will result in pressure being applied on the libyan leader to improve human rights and end corruption then it 's welcome .
otherwise it just vindicates all those who believe the usa and uk support dictators if they abide by their terms mansour ben salim , uk a challenge to mansour ben salim , u.k. i just want you to know that that guy you consider a villain has invested his power , money to mention but a few , to his people .
they like him that 's why he is there up to now .
if you do right to your people they will learn to endure you even though your rule is not democratic .
have consideration for your people then let others come next , and that 's what he stands for .
we hope that western countries are more friend than a foe .
libya stands for achievement - that 's why it 's remained isolated but stable .
regie , usa yes , i think libya does deserve another chance .
one of the best ways to fight terrorism is to show these rogue countries that if they choose to improve the lives of their people and act like a responsible country , the benefits far outweigh the negative aspects that come with being labelled a nation of repression and terrorism .
chad o 'dell , usa what is happening now is very magnanimous of the libyan regime alan salisbury , england libya has always been an easy target for the us .
i had just left libya when president reagan chose to bomb tripoli in retaliation for the killing of us troops in germany .
a subsequent investigation showed it was an entirely different group , not connected with libya , which had carried out the atrocity .
col gaddafi lost a daughter in that raid .
i can understand the relatives of the victims of the pan am flight having to find somebody to blame but the lockerbie trial was badly flawed and i will never believe that the libyan government was responsible .
i feel that what is happening now is very magnanimous of the libyan regime and i very much hope we can build upon this new initiative .
alan salisbury , england people who say that it is wrong to try to bring libya into the global community ought to check their homes carefully for japanese goods -lrb- second world war atrocities -rrb- ; german goods -lrb- the blitz -rrb- ; us goods -lrb- the war of independence -rrb- ; i could go on .
there has to come a time when a line is drawn under events , however painful that might be .
gaddafi the friend is easier to control that gaddafi the fiend .
philip , england this is the wrong time to be currying favour with veteran sponsors of terrorism david , usa / uk this is precisely the wrong time to be currying favour with veteran sponsors of terrorism like gaddafi .
there is a new world order now , as saddam is about to find out .
gaddafi should be next .
david , usa / uk i think that gaddafi has finally learned how to behave .
he has suffered nothing but rebuffs over the last 20 years , from the humiliation of his army in chad , to the punitive us air raids back in the 1980s .
i think he will now be just like any other tinpot dictator , happy to stay within his own borders and oppress his own .
since most of the world is ruled by dictators , there is no more point in singling him out anymore .
tom byrne , usa as churchill once said : " it is better to jaw-jaw , than to war-war . "
david gatenby , germany as soon as libya apologises and submits for trial -lrb- as it did with lockerbie -rrb- the murderers of wpc yvonne fletcher , then britain may start to think about normal relations .
not until then , however .
tim , geneva , switzerland it is a great and important step that has been taken by britain .
i am certain that all libyans will recognise this .
further steps should be achieved to make the relations between the two countries more solid and valid .
abdelbaset elyagoubi , canada every country has breached international law or human rights at some time or another , including the uk .
some of our partners and allies , including some commonwealth members still continue to do so today .
if libya really has changed , then to continue to ostracise it would be hypocritical .
mm zaman , uk / us now is the time to leave the past behind ahmed bishari , libya libya and the uk both have long term mutual interests .
now is the time to leave the past behind and look towards the future .
i sincerely hope that both countries can overcome their differences and work for the common good of their people .
libya needs the uk just as much as the uk needs libya .
ahmed bishari , libya i recently worked in libya for over two years .
everyone has a good basic standard of living .
colonel gaddafi may have done some stupid things in his younger days , but he certainly should be readmitted into the world community !
the warm and friendly people of his country deserve to benefit from this .
david worsley , norway as a brit i am very disappointed that our government is taking this action .
gaddafi 's regime has been widely linked to the murder of friends of mine in the pan am terrorist attack .
he has funded terrorism and publicly supported terrorist groups .
are we about to make the mistake neville chamberlain made with adolf hitler ?
paul , usa / uk it seems like gaddafi has been trying to make himself appear like the leader of a civilised country .
i do n't know if this is just spin for the masses , but from where i sit it looks like the man is trying to shed himself of the terrorist supporter image .
i like what i see .
curtis tindell , fort worth , usa libya could potentially be a powerful force for good stuart , uk though the libyan regime has many faults , their record on human rights is nowhere near as bad as that of our so-called friends in the gulf like kuwait or saudi arabia .
nor is there any evidence of recent state involvement in terrorist activities .
libya could potentially be a powerful force for good , not just in the middle east but in several of the african hotspots .
we should not let the american longing for vengeance on a country which has often thumbed its nose at the west prevent us from developing such a potentially useful ally .
stuart , uk i think it 's time to give libya a chance .
the country may have been responsible for terrorist activities in the past , but it would be foolish to permanently put a country out to pasture because of it .
libya has paid a price for terror before and has been relatively quiet since then .
i think it 's time countries like great britain and the united states , at the very least , see what libya has to offer .
dave s , usa all too often it seems countries are ostracised for years by the international community for isolated incidents , or actions perpetrated by a few leaders .
for the world to reach some kind of harmony , everyone must be given some chance at repentance and re-acceptance back into the international community .
recent world events have shown that the alternative is bloodshed and chaos .
jim , uk colonel gaddafi has been a key player in middle east affairs ever since he took power in libya .
securing his support , irrespective of the " axis of evil " tag , would be crucial in the war against international terrorism .
we certainly have more to gain by improving relations , and restoring relations would encourage libya to do more towards being accepted back into the international community .
an opportunity that should not be missed .

the shortlist and winner are decided by a group of judges who look for creativity and artistic credibility , rather than commercial success .
the chairman of the judges , simon frith , described the shortlist as " the most joyful " for years .
but what did you think ?
this debate is now closed .
a selection of your comments is below .
have your say vote who should win the 2002 mercury music prize ?
beverley knight the bees the coral david bowie doves the electric soft parade gemma hayes guy barker joanna macgregor ms dynamite roots manuva the streets beverley knight embarrasses the uk with her talent .
in america a black singer with her talent would reign supreme but england does not and will not embrace her talent the way it should .
maybe she needs to sell out to simon fuller , capital radio and the marketing machine , then perhaps we would have a soul diva on our hands .
good for you bev , for keeping black british soul music alive and being proud .
good luck for tonight .
mike radcliffe , uk if the mercury music prize is to go to a new and original british act then only two fit the bill , the streets and roots manuva , the others have been done before but these two are truly " brand new " .
praise be to mike skinner .
we hear you brother .
james searle , uxbridge , uk gemma hayes should win , though her album is not as good as her eps and b-sides .
oddly , though , i have to wonder where idlewild are the best band to come out of scotland since simple minds and the proclaimers .
scott b , uk how many people in this country have got bbc four ?
after many years of making little impact the mercury prize is starting to generate real interest and making people like me aware of new and exciting music .
bbci 's coverage has been excellent .
it is a shame therefore that the award ceremony itself has been relegated from a channel the majority of people could watch martin kinoulty , england .
nice to see a mix of acts , ages and styles .
out of all the music awards held every year , mercury at least pays some homage to talent and substance in an industry otherwise drowning in repetative dance acts and bubble-gum teen pop .
thankfully no nomination for s club juniors then ...
phil , london , uk by far the best and diverse nominations for ages .
i hope the streets wins the prize , but it 's no bad thing if any of them do .
aj , england .
congratulations to all those nominated , but it 's a disappointing selection .
once again , the panel have largely failed to look further than the current music press darlings , yielding yet another predictably pompous shortlist .
also sad to see such a poor showing for dance and electronic acts .
what no boards of canada ?
keli richards , uk i 've only heard two of the albums on the shortlist .
but for those two at least , i have to agree with them - they are excellent albums .
its just nice to be free of pop trash at least once a year !
matt , uk bowie . complete bobbins - he has always been overrated but this is ridiculous .
paul fisher , england if the prize is judged on creativity , then it has to go to the streets for the newest sound in years .
much as i like bowie , i think that he 's been around too long to receive an award like this .
ben smith , uk the mercury music prize is a good thing because it introduces new music to people who otherwise would not have even heard of the majority of the artists let alone taken a chance and bought a copy of the album .
there are some great albums in this years nominations - coral , the doves , the streets and in my opinion the best debut album by a british band since oasis released definitely , maybe - the electric soft parade 's holes in the wall .
i hope that any of these four bands win so that they get the acclaim they rightly deserve and then more people will realise that there actually is some good music out there today , even though it may not get in the top ten .
chris gould , oman -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- beverley knight ?
ha ha ha ha !
shurely shome mishtake ?
whitney houston karaoke - just what the world needs !
for god 's sake do n't encourage the woman to produce anymore sentimental god-awful ballads .
it 's got to be the streets this year - real music from the uk , not a poor interpretation of bad american music .
stu , uk i wish the judges were honest enough to cut the jazz and classical albums that get a token showing in the nominations .
guy barker and joanna macgregor are both very very fine musicians , but are not representative of their very wide and eclectic fields .
james , uk please not the streets .
definitely some of the most embarrassing and cringing rubbish i 've ever heard .
do n't let them win !
luke , england some very good nominees there , in particular roots manuva , the streets and gemma hayes .
i hope gemma hayes wins due to the fact that she is from somewhere close to where i live .
from a musical stand point , i 'd rather roots manuva won , i enjoyed run come save me more than original pirate material .
i find it strange that bowie is nominated , i thought the mercury prize was for relatively new / young acts .
ruairi de burca , ireland a diverse shortlist as ever , but much as i like the bowie album , is n't he a bit long in the tooth ? !
and where is the excellent black rebel motorcycle club ?
jon , london yes as diverse as ever , but of the albums i know not one of them excels like winners in the past .
the coral , doves , electric soft parade are good albums but none really shine .
as for bowie or beverley knight , scraping the barrel .
the bees , the streets or ms dynamite are the only significant albums that i 've heard from the list .
andrew leedham , england if you 've not heard it , check out joanna macgregor 's play - pure genius and not wholly " classical " .
vid , uk i want the album that has universal approval amongst people i know -lrb- a rarity ! -rrb- to win - run come save me by roots manuva .
his lyrics are not pseudo-american rubbish , but about british life , things recognisable to us .
same goes for the streets ; either would be a win for a truly brilliant and innovative , very british album .
grace , london i 've been unable to find either a list of who the judges are or any description of how the shortlist is drawn up .
without this basic information i do n't see why any music buyer should take the prize seriously .
at least if i buy a music magazine , i can see who 's written the review .
peter reavy , n. ireland doves , without a doubt , if only for the magnificent track pounding .
andy , london contrary to some other opinions voiced here , i believe it was exceedingly daring of the mercury judges to nominate the bowie album .
it is a wonderful collection of tracks and deserves recognition on that basis , regardless of the fact that he 's released so much quality music already .
phil reeves , uk the electric soft parade album deserves to win .
it 's exciting , varied , and original .
certainly better than anything bowie has done for the last 30 years ... although i saw labyrinth again last night .
chris , usa -lrb- via ni -rrb- only three acts that are truly original - the streets , roots manuva and the bees - like to see the prize make a difference - so the bees gets my vote - probably the least well known and a truly beautiful album .
time to put the isle of wight on the map .
ian white , uk i like doves , they 're a great band , and they deserve to win that prize .
thumbs up for their performances !
n21 , france the mercury music prize is a sham , the list smacks of industry back slapping , the exclusion of the reindeer sections 's son of evil reindeer shows a dispicable lack of musical taste .
the album works on so many more levels than that of the bees for example , which is a two song album at best .
i fear that big fat brown envelopes have been changing hands and that the music industry , especially mercury , should be ashamed of themselves .
simon , scotland having followed the music scene for the last 45 years , i was fortunate enough to see the most exciting band i have seen in years at the manchester uni gig last june .
ca n't wait for the coral to make it big time .
wade , oz i think it should go to doves .
i agree with andy from london , pounding is excellent and the best track on the album .
was lucky enough to see them live in amsterdam and their drummer is unbelievable , fantastic .
rupert fisher , the netherlands -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- got to be the streets to win , although glad roots manuva and ms dynamite are included .
but why on earth are the mercury panel still so enthralled by guitar music ?
the vast majority of guitar-led bands are just doing rehashes of old genres that were pedestrian at the best of times .
i doubt very much whether the panel would ever be brave enough to nominate some truly orignal work - high contrast anyone ?
i suppose the panel feel that they do n't have to acknowledge drum ' n ' bass since roni size won for the -lrb- average -rrb- new forms .
oh well , at least there 's no oasis .
now that would just be plain insufferable .
david bowley , uk i 'm sure gemma hayes is a lovely girl , but one dido was quite enough , i do n't think we need an irish one too .
and where are spiritualized ?
steve evans , brighton , uk has to be doves or the coral .
fantastic music .
the streets are different but it just makes me cringe and bowie is a has-been .
paul , manchester , uk the brmc are american which is why they are n't nominated .
bowie has made his best album in years and surely deserves some recognition for that .. will the streets still be making quality music in 30 years ?
david , uk on the whole a good shortlist , reflecting mercury 's usual eclecticism .
however , i agree with keli richards : i was very disappointed not to see a nom for boards of canada 's beautiful , haunting and ethereal soundscape of an album , geogaddi .
neil , england it 's gotta be the bees for all out summery genius like never before !
the streets is barely listenable after more than a couple of times , and the rest are po-faced numpties .
the bees !
doug , uk nah , nah , nah .
whither aphex twins superb drukgs or the lo-fidelity allstars ' do n't be afraid of love which manages to touch base with every musical cornerstone of the last 30 years and yet still be dazzlingly original .
these mercury dudes do n't know they 're born ... quite nice to see the streets nominated though -lrb- ! -rrb-
phil stark , england joanna macgregor deserves to win for her ability to cross so many musical boundaries .
above all her sheer musical excellence is a key element for her deserving a prize such as this .
david butcher , uk the winner should be gemma hayes , but the award went to a female singer-songwriter last year , so i reckon it 'll go to the streets .
david renfree , uk three or four excellent choices , one or two duds , but who nominated beverley knight ? !
i suppose there 's always some token pap in there , but remember when the judges let their guard down and the execrable m-people sneaked in to inexplicably win - let that be a lesson to the judges not to repeat the mistakes of history ...
by the way jon , black rebel motorcycle club may have produced a mighty fine album , but unfortunately they suffer in the nomination stakes from being distinctly american .
ian , uk beverley knight and david bowie , but no idlewild !
that just does n't make sense .
they surely can not claim that it is too recent to be entered as the coral 's album only came out this week .
anyway , my vote goes to gemma hayes .
a great debut album .
steven , uk i love bowie and like his new album ... what can i say ?
bowie = da winner , great .
robbin , netherlands it 's about time bowie 's greatness was acknowledged .
it is irrelevant that he has been around for yonks .
it is the music that matters , and no one is making it as good as he is .
no-one .
he is that rare thing in pop culture - a true artist .
davanna , usa it 's an interesting list and has quite a few of my faves .
i think putting bowie forward is great .
he has inspired a number of those on the list and his latest album is great .
but i expect the doves to win .
noel , london , uk the irish dido ? !
who said that ?
i discovered gemma hayes last summer when i found her debut ep in a shop in france .
all acoustic , i loved it , and i love her album .
there 's a variety and depth to her material far beyond the bland likes of dido .
paddy , ni oh no !
the mercury music prize is being spoiled by tedious " garidge " rubbish like the streets ...
a pretty good list , but losing the " garidge " would make it even better .
tom , uk if further proof was needed that the mercury is a popularity prize rather than a serious award for musical talent it will come with the inevitable failure of either joanna macgregor or guy barker to win .
in any sane universe they 'd be so far ahead you would n't see the rest of the pack .
simon barrow , england in response to paul fisher re bowie , this is obviously a comment from someone who has n't taken the time to listen to his new album .
to have come back from the wilderness after such a long time demonstrates his nous for creating great music .
he or doves should win , but i 'm sure the streets will .
sean , england i do n't believe it , where are kid galahad in the nominations ?
they are by far the most talented original band in today 's music scene .
who nominated these bands anyway ? ? ?
ken bull , uk an eclectic list , but they 're all pop albums .
i 'm disappointed not to see geogaddi by boards of canada nominated -lrb- although i suspect warp records probably did n't enter them -rrb- .
out of the list , i 'd like doves to win .
it 's the best predominantly guitar-based album in a long time .
duncan stephen , united kingdom please do n't let the streets win !
it 's not original , it just sounds like that because no one else would dare release something so awful !
people should stop criticising bowie , the new album has a nice range of styles and has a fantastic sound - well worth the seven year wait .
roots manuva is a fine album , but perhaps not quite good enough to win .
doves have used marketing tricks to get where they are , and while the album is good , it is n't fantastic .
the other nominees almost feel like token entries from the other genres and are unlikely to win .
yet again they 've missed out shortlisting several much better albums .
rob nicholls , england bowie has produced a great album and definitely deserves his nomination .
a few people have mentioned his age ... not sure what that has to to with anything .
i expect that the coral will win though .
jm , uk roots manuva because his album is simply a brilliant piece of uk originality .
the streets is a shocking nomination .
his music is purile .
i feel embarrassed to come from the same city as that man .
paul , uk of course david bowie !
not only has he released one of the best albums of his career but also the best of the year .
his nominee is a surprise only because the british have no memory .
for god 's sake , who will remember doves or coral in 30 years from now ?
no one , although bowie will agree that the streets album is very good !
sakis dimitrakopoulos , greece the electric soft parade should win for sure .
the album is the most refreshing music i 've heard for a long time .
in fact it 's the first time in years that an album has just blown me away on the first listen .
they have an uncanny knack for strong melodic choruses , and the songs are very well written .
the production is great , sounds like they went to town with pro tools .
very , very well done indeed !
toby hammond , uk although the list of nominees is pretty awesome , i could n't shake off my disappointment that kid galahad failed to appear .
live they are astounding , fully giving voice to their eclectic sound and they have one of the best frontmen i have ever seen .
utterly inspiring .
kate , england can not believe that kid galahad , one of this country 's finest new bands is not included in the nominations .
charlie bones , uk obviously joanna macgregor has bags of talent and deserves an award for bucking the trend in the classical genre and seeking to promote and introduce a wide-variety of lesser known compositions , rather than re-hash the well-known ones - classic fm style .
she even set up her own record label .
however , joanna macgregor ¿ s never gonna win - it 's a token gesture , particularly as the record companies can ¿ t make any money out of her !
tim , uk as the mercury prize has been going a few years now , its time to decide about the obviously token classical and jazz nominations .
as it 's a relatively weak year in rock / pop , it could be a good chance to give it to guy barker .
not the best jazz album of the year , but definitely worthy of acclaim .
bowie , god bless you maam , my personal favourite of the list , but probably does n't need the gong .
of the rest , the streets are riding the zeitgeist , but the music is not the most inspiring .
in summary , i think the gong should go to bev knight , so all the quality acts are treated fairly and the mercury prize can retain its spirit of contrariness .
giles , england great to see the mercury list again this year - the highlight of the music awards .
of the ones i 've heard i love most of them , the ones i have n't heard - well , the mercury just makes me wanna go out and hear ' em .
of course we are all gonna hate one or two of them - that 's the idea , a diverse range of music .
i would hate it if i liked them all - ' cos then it would just be pop , would n't it ?
robson robstar , england i think the streets is getting a bit of a hard review from people .
yes , it touches on the cringeworthy , but it does present some more interesting points of view -lrb- that people may not always appreciate -rrb- , and i think there is creativity in there that warrants nomination .
however , it is with out a shadow of a doubt , in my opinion , that doves should win .
both their albums have shown the world that guitars and decent production can go together to create music that breaks through the usual din of many of today 's new bands , and i believe they still lead the pack in " creativity and artistic credibility " .
to those who complain that the nominations are too guitar based , i would say there are two reasons for that ... 1 -rrb- there has been way too much garage , r 'n'b and rubbish like of that type recently , that the judges will never be able to battle through the tripe to the beef -lrb- if there is any -rrb- within 12 months and 2 -rrb- to make music with an instrument relies on passion and not just creativity .
anyone can press a key . see ?
the only feeling there is at the end of my finger !
mezza , uk i ca n't stand garage music , but the streets prove that its originality and quality that counts , not genre .
will he be making good music in 30 years ?
who cares , this is a great album .
joseph , england if the bees do n't win this i 'll eat my mother .
kerry jarman , uk the bees ?
what ?
there are thousands of bands at this level .
this smacks of backhanders .
they 're good but not that good .
for god 's sake !
however take roots manuva who has made two exceptional albums seeping originality that does n't deny where it comes from in the world .
this music is progressing forward not looking back .
let 's think about this .

the shortlist and winner are decided by a group of judges who look for creativity and artistic credibility , rather than commercial success .
the chairman of the judges , simon frith , described the shortlist as " the most joyful " for years .
but what did you think ?
this debate is now closed .
a selection of your comments is below . vote who should win the 2002 mercury music prize ?
beverley knight the bees the coral david bowie doves the electric soft parade gemma hayes guy barker joanna macgregor ms dynamite roots manuva the streets beverley knight embarrasses the uk with her talent .
in america a black singer with her talent would reign supreme but england does not and will not embrace her talent the way it should .
maybe she needs to sell out to simon fuller , capital radio and the marketing machine , then perhaps we would have a soul diva on our hands .
good for you bev , for keeping black british soul music alive and being proud .
good luck for tonight .
mike radcliffe , uk if the mercury music prize is to go to a new and original british act then only two fit the bill , the streets and roots manuva , the others have been done before but these two are truly " brand new " .
praise be to mike skinner .
we hear you brother .
james searle , uxbridge , uk gemma hayes should win , though her album is not as good as her eps and b-sides .
oddly , though , i have to wonder where idlewild are the best band to come out of scotland since simple minds and the proclaimers .
scott b , uk how many people in this country have got bbc four ?
after many years of making little impact the mercury prize is starting to generate real interest and making people like me aware of new and exciting music .
bbci 's coverage has been excellent .
it is a shame therefore that the award ceremony itself has been relegated from a channel the majority of people could watch martin kinoulty , england .
nice to see a mix of acts , ages and styles .
out of all the music awards held every year , mercury at least pays some homage to talent and substance in an industry otherwise drowning in repetative dance acts and bubble-gum teen pop .
thankfully no nomination for s club juniors then ...
phil , london , uk by far the best and diverse nominations for ages .
i hope the streets wins the prize , but it 's no bad thing if any of them do .
aj , england .
congratulations to all those nominated , but it 's a disappointing selection .
once again , the panel have largely failed to look further than the current music press darlings , yielding yet another predictably pompous shortlist .
also sad to see such a poor showing for dance and electronic acts .
what no boards of canada ?
keli richards , uk i 've only heard two of the albums on the shortlist .
but for those two at least , i have to agree with them - they are excellent albums .
its just nice to be free of pop trash at least once a year !
matt , uk bowie . complete bobbins - he has always been overrated but this is ridiculous .
paul fisher , england if the prize is judged on creativity , then it has to go to the streets for the newest sound in years .
much as i like bowie , i think that he 's been around too long to receive an award like this .
ben smith , uk the mercury music prize is a good thing because it introduces new music to people who otherwise would not have even heard of the majority of the artists let alone taken a chance and bought a copy of the album .
there are some great albums in this years nominations - coral , the doves , the streets and in my opinion the best debut album by a british band since oasis released definitely , maybe - the electric soft parade 's holes in the wall .
i hope that any of these four bands win so that they get the acclaim they rightly deserve and then more people will realise that there actually is some good music out there today , even though it may not get in the top ten .
chris gould , oman -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- beverley knight ?
ha ha ha ha !
shurely shome mishtake ?
whitney houston karaoke - just what the world needs !
for god 's sake do n't encourage the woman to produce anymore sentimental god-awful ballads .
it 's got to be the streets this year - real music from the uk , not a poor interpretation of bad american music .
stu , uk i wish the judges were honest enough to cut the jazz and classical albums that get a token showing in the nominations .
guy barker and joanna macgregor are both very very fine musicians , but are not representative of their very wide and eclectic fields .
james , uk please not the streets .
definitely some of the most embarrassing and cringing rubbish i 've ever heard .
do n't let them win !
luke , england some very good nominees there , in particular roots manuva , the streets and gemma hayes .
i hope gemma hayes wins due to the fact that she is from somewhere close to where i live .
from a musical stand point , i 'd rather roots manuva won , i enjoyed run come save me more than original pirate material .
i find it strange that bowie is nominated , i thought the mercury prize was for relatively new / young acts .
ruairi de burca , ireland a diverse shortlist as ever , but much as i like the bowie album , is n't he a bit long in the tooth ? !
and where is the excellent black rebel motorcycle club ?
jon , london yes as diverse as ever , but of the albums i know not one of them excels like winners in the past .
the coral , doves , electric soft parade are good albums but none really shine .
as for bowie or beverley knight , scraping the barrel .
the bees , the streets or ms dynamite are the only significant albums that i 've heard from the list .
andrew leedham , england if you 've not heard it , check out joanna macgregor 's play - pure genius and not wholly " classical " .
vid , uk i want the album that has universal approval amongst people i know -lrb- a rarity ! -rrb- to win - run come save me by roots manuva .
his lyrics are not pseudo-american rubbish , but about british life , things recognisable to us .
same goes for the streets ; either would be a win for a truly brilliant and innovative , very british album .
grace , london i 've been unable to find either a list of who the judges are or any description of how the shortlist is drawn up .
without this basic information i do n't see why any music buyer should take the prize seriously .
at least if i buy a music magazine , i can see who 's written the review .
peter reavy , n. ireland doves , without a doubt , if only for the magnificent track pounding .
andy , london contrary to some other opinions voiced here , i believe it was exceedingly daring of the mercury judges to nominate the bowie album .
it is a wonderful collection of tracks and deserves recognition on that basis , regardless of the fact that he 's released so much quality music already .
phil reeves , uk the electric soft parade album deserves to win .
it 's exciting , varied , and original .
certainly better than anything bowie has done for the last 30 years ... although i saw labyrinth again last night .
chris , usa -lrb- via ni -rrb- only three acts that are truly original - the streets , roots manuva and the bees - like to see the prize make a difference - so the bees gets my vote - probably the least well known and a truly beautiful album .
time to put the isle of wight on the map .
ian white , uk i like doves , they 're a great band , and they deserve to win that prize .
thumbs up for their performances !
n21 , france the mercury music prize is a sham , the list smacks of industry back slapping , the exclusion of the reindeer sections 's son of evil reindeer shows a dispicable lack of musical taste .
the album works on so many more levels than that of the bees for example , which is a two song album at best .
i fear that big fat brown envelopes have been changing hands and that the music industry , especially mercury , should be ashamed of themselves .
simon , scotland having followed the music scene for the last 45 years , i was fortunate enough to see the most exciting band i have seen in years at the manchester uni gig last june .
ca n't wait for the coral to make it big time .
wade , oz i think it should go to doves .
i agree with andy from london , pounding is excellent and the best track on the album .
was lucky enough to see them live in amsterdam and their drummer is unbelievable , fantastic .
rupert fisher , the netherlands -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- got to be the streets to win , although glad roots manuva and ms dynamite are included .
but why on earth are the mercury panel still so enthralled by guitar music ?
the vast majority of guitar-led bands are just doing rehashes of old genres that were pedestrian at the best of times .
i doubt very much whether the panel would ever be brave enough to nominate some truly orignal work - high contrast anyone ?
i suppose the panel feel that they do n't have to acknowledge drum ' n ' bass since roni size won for the -lrb- average -rrb- new forms .
oh well , at least there 's no oasis .
now that would just be plain insufferable .
david bowley , uk i 'm sure gemma hayes is a lovely girl , but one dido was quite enough , i do n't think we need an irish one too .
and where are spiritualized ?
steve evans , brighton , uk has to be doves or the coral .
fantastic music .
the streets are different but it just makes me cringe and bowie is a has-been .
paul , manchester , uk the brmc are american which is why they are n't nominated .
bowie has made his best album in years and surely deserves some recognition for that .. will the streets still be making quality music in 30 years ?
david , uk on the whole a good shortlist , reflecting mercury 's usual eclecticism .
however , i agree with keli richards : i was very disappointed not to see a nom for boards of canada 's beautiful , haunting and ethereal soundscape of an album , geogaddi .
neil , england it 's gotta be the bees for all out summery genius like never before !
the streets is barely listenable after more than a couple of times , and the rest are po-faced numpties .
the bees !
doug , uk nah , nah , nah .
whither aphex twins superb drukgs or the lo-fidelity allstars ' do n't be afraid of love which manages to touch base with every musical cornerstone of the last 30 years and yet still be dazzlingly original .
these mercury dudes do n't know they 're born ... quite nice to see the streets nominated though -lrb- ! -rrb-
phil stark , england joanna macgregor deserves to win for her ability to cross so many musical boundaries .
above all her sheer musical excellence is a key element for her deserving a prize such as this .
david butcher , uk the winner should be gemma hayes , but the award went to a female singer-songwriter last year , so i reckon it 'll go to the streets .
david renfree , uk three or four excellent choices , one or two duds , but who nominated beverley knight ? !
i suppose there 's always some token pap in there , but remember when the judges let their guard down and the execrable m-people sneaked in to inexplicably win - let that be a lesson to the judges not to repeat the mistakes of history ...
by the way jon , black rebel motorcycle club may have produced a mighty fine album , but unfortunately they suffer in the nomination stakes from being distinctly american .
ian , uk beverley knight and david bowie , but no idlewild !
that just does n't make sense .
they surely can not claim that it is too recent to be entered as the coral 's album only came out this week .
anyway , my vote goes to gemma hayes .
a great debut album .
steven , uk i love bowie and like his new album ... what can i say ?
bowie = da winner , great .
robbin , netherlands it 's about time bowie 's greatness was acknowledged .
it is irrelevant that he has been around for yonks .
it is the music that matters , and no one is making it as good as he is .
no-one .
he is that rare thing in pop culture - a true artist .
davanna , usa it 's an interesting list and has quite a few of my faves .
i think putting bowie forward is great .
he has inspired a number of those on the list and his latest album is great .
but i expect the doves to win .
noel , london , uk the irish dido ? !
who said that ?
i discovered gemma hayes last summer when i found her debut ep in a shop in france .
all acoustic , i loved it , and i love her album .
there 's a variety and depth to her material far beyond the bland likes of dido .
paddy , ni oh no !
the mercury music prize is being spoiled by tedious " garidge " rubbish like the streets ...
a pretty good list , but losing the " garidge " would make it even better .
tom , uk if further proof was needed that the mercury is a popularity prize rather than a serious award for musical talent it will come with the inevitable failure of either joanna macgregor or guy barker to win .
in any sane universe they 'd be so far ahead you would n't see the rest of the pack .
simon barrow , england in response to paul fisher re bowie , this is obviously a comment from someone who has n't taken the time to listen to his new album .
to have come back from the wilderness after such a long time demonstrates his nous for creating great music .
he or doves should win , but i 'm sure the streets will .
sean , england i do n't believe it , where are kid galahad in the nominations ?
they are by far the most talented original band in today 's music scene .
who nominated these bands anyway ? ? ?
ken bull , uk an eclectic list , but they 're all pop albums .
i 'm disappointed not to see geogaddi by boards of canada nominated -lrb- although i suspect warp records probably did n't enter them -rrb- .
out of the list , i 'd like doves to win .
it 's the best predominantly guitar-based album in a long time .
duncan stephen , united kingdom please do n't let the streets win !
it 's not original , it just sounds like that because no one else would dare release something so awful !
people should stop criticising bowie , the new album has a nice range of styles and has a fantastic sound - well worth the seven year wait .
roots manuva is a fine album , but perhaps not quite good enough to win .
doves have used marketing tricks to get where they are , and while the album is good , it is n't fantastic .
the other nominees almost feel like token entries from the other genres and are unlikely to win .
yet again they 've missed out shortlisting several much better albums .
rob nicholls , england bowie has produced a great album and definitely deserves his nomination .
a few people have mentioned his age ... not sure what that has to to with anything .
i expect that the coral will win though .
jm , uk roots manuva because his album is simply a brilliant piece of uk originality .
the streets is a shocking nomination .
his music is purile .
i feel embarrassed to come from the same city as that man .
paul , uk of course david bowie !
not only has he released one of the best albums of his career but also the best of the year .
his nominee is a surprise only because the british have no memory .
for god 's sake , who will remember doves or coral in 30 years from now ?
no one , although bowie will agree that the streets album is very good !
sakis dimitrakopoulos , greece the electric soft parade should win for sure .
the album is the most refreshing music i 've heard for a long time .
in fact it 's the first time in years that an album has just blown me away on the first listen .
they have an uncanny knack for strong melodic choruses , and the songs are very well written .
the production is great , sounds like they went to town with pro tools .
very , very well done indeed !
toby hammond , uk although the list of nominees is pretty awesome , i could n't shake off my disappointment that kid galahad failed to appear .
live they are astounding , fully giving voice to their eclectic sound and they have one of the best frontmen i have ever seen .
utterly inspiring .
kate , england can not believe that kid galahad , one of this country 's finest new bands is not included in the nominations .
charlie bones , uk obviously joanna macgregor has bags of talent and deserves an award for bucking the trend in the classical genre and seeking to promote and introduce a wide-variety of lesser known compositions , rather than re-hash the well-known ones - classic fm style .
she even set up her own record label .
however , joanna macgregor ¿ s never gonna win - it 's a token gesture , particularly as the record companies can ¿ t make any money out of her !
tim , uk as the mercury prize has been going a few years now , its time to decide about the obviously token classical and jazz nominations .
as it 's a relatively weak year in rock / pop , it could be a good chance to give it to guy barker .
not the best jazz album of the year , but definitely worthy of acclaim .
bowie , god bless you maam , my personal favourite of the list , but probably does n't need the gong .
of the rest , the streets are riding the zeitgeist , but the music is not the most inspiring .
in summary , i think the gong should go to bev knight , so all the quality acts are treated fairly and the mercury prize can retain its spirit of contrariness .
giles , england great to see the mercury list again this year - the highlight of the music awards .
of the ones i 've heard i love most of them , the ones i have n't heard - well , the mercury just makes me wanna go out and hear ' em .
of course we are all gonna hate one or two of them - that 's the idea , a diverse range of music .
i would hate it if i liked them all - ' cos then it would just be pop , would n't it ?
robson robstar , england i think the streets is getting a bit of a hard review from people .
yes , it touches on the cringeworthy , but it does present some more interesting points of view -lrb- that people may not always appreciate -rrb- , and i think there is creativity in there that warrants nomination .
however , it is with out a shadow of a doubt , in my opinion , that doves should win .
both their albums have shown the world that guitars and decent production can go together to create music that breaks through the usual din of many of today 's new bands , and i believe they still lead the pack in " creativity and artistic credibility " .
to those who complain that the nominations are too guitar based , i would say there are two reasons for that ... 1 -rrb- there has been way too much garage , r 'n'b and rubbish like of that type recently , that the judges will never be able to battle through the tripe to the beef -lrb- if there is any -rrb- within 12 months and 2 -rrb- to make music with an instrument relies on passion and not just creativity .
anyone can press a key . see ?
the only feeling there is at the end of my finger !
mezza , uk i ca n't stand garage music , but the streets prove that its originality and quality that counts , not genre .
will he be making good music in 30 years ?
who cares , this is a great album .
joseph , england if the bees do n't win this i 'll eat my mother .
kerry jarman , uk the bees ?
what ?
there are thousands of bands at this level .
this smacks of backhanders .
they 're good but not that good .
for god 's sake !
however take roots manuva who has made two exceptional albums seeping originality that does n't deny where it comes from in the world .
this music is progressing forward not looking back .
let 's think about this .

the shortlist and winner are decided by a group of judges who look for creativity and artistic credibility , rather than commercial success .
the chairman of the judges , simon frith , described the shortlist as " the most joyful " for years .
but what did you think ?
this debate is now closed .
a selection of your comments is below . vote results who should win the 2002 mercury music prize ?
beverley knight 4.97 % the bees 4.31 % the coral 5.08 % david bowie 20.00 % doves 18.23 % the electric soft parade 4.64 % gemma hayes 6.63 % guy barker 0.99 % joanna macgregor 3.09 % ms dynamite 4.42 % roots manuva 9.50 % the streets 18.12 % 905 votes cast results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion beverley knight embarrasses the uk with her talent .
in america a black singer with her talent would reign supreme but england does not and will not embrace her talent the way it should .
maybe she needs to sell out to simon fuller , capital radio and the marketing machine , then perhaps we would have a soul diva on our hands .
good for you bev , for keeping black british soul music alive and being proud .
good luck for tonight .
mike radcliffe , uk if the mercury music prize is to go to a new and original british act then only two fit the bill , the streets and roots manuva , the others have been done before but these two are truly " brand new " .
praise be to mike skinner .
we hear you brother .
james searle , uxbridge , uk gemma hayes should win , though her album is not as good as her eps and b-sides .
oddly , though , i have to wonder where idlewild are the best band to come out of scotland since simple minds and the proclaimers .
scott b , uk how many people in this country have got bbc four ?
after many years of making little impact the mercury prize is starting to generate real interest and making people like me aware of new and exciting music .
bbci 's coverage has been excellent .
it is a shame therefore that the award ceremony itself has been relegated from a channel the majority of people could watch martin kinoulty , england .

in any sane universe they 'd be so far ahead you would n't see the rest of the pack .
simon barrow , england in response to paul fisher re bowie , this is obviously a comment from someone who has n't taken the time to listen to his new album .
to have come back from the wilderness after such a long time demonstrates his nous for creating great music .
he or doves should win , but i 'm sure the streets will .
sean , england i do n't believe it , where are kid galahad in the nominations ?
they are by far the most talented original band in today 's music scene .
who nominated these bands anyway ? ? ?
ken bull , uk an eclectic list , but they 're all pop albums .
i 'm disappointed not to see geogaddi by boards of canada nominated -lrb- although i suspect warp records probably did n't enter them -rrb- .
out of the list , i 'd like doves to win .
it 's the best predominantly guitar-based album in a long time .
duncan stephen , united kingdom please do n't let the streets win !
it 's not original , it just sounds like that because no one else would dare release something so awful !
people should stop criticising bowie , the new album has a nice range of styles and has a fantastic sound - well worth the seven year wait .
roots manuva is a fine album , but perhaps not quite good enough to win .
doves have used marketing tricks to get where they are , and while the album is good , it is n't fantastic .
the other nominees almost feel like token entries from the other genres and are unlikely to win .
yet again they 've missed out shortlisting several much better albums .
rob nicholls , england bowie has produced a great album and definitely deserves his nomination .
a few people have mentioned his age ... not sure what that has to to with anything .
i expect that the coral will win though .
jm , uk roots manuva because his album is simply a brilliant piece of uk originality .
the streets is a shocking nomination .
his music is purile .
i feel embarrassed to come from the same city as that man .
paul , uk of course david bowie !
not only has he released one of the best albums of his career but also the best of the year .
his nominee is a surprise only because the british have no memory .
for god 's sake , who will remember doves or coral in 30 years from now ?
no one , although bowie will agree that the streets album is very good !
sakis dimitrakopoulos , greece the electric soft parade should win for sure .
the album is the most refreshing music i 've heard for a long time .
in fact it 's the first time in years that an album has just blown me away on the first listen .
they have an uncanny knack for strong melodic choruses , and the songs are very well written .
the production is great , sounds like they went to town with pro tools .
very , very well done indeed !
toby hammond , uk although the list of nominees is pretty awesome , i could n't shake off my disappointment that kid galahad failed to appear .
live they are astounding , fully giving voice to their eclectic sound and they have one of the best frontmen i have ever seen .
utterly inspiring .
kate , england can not believe that kid galahad , one of this country 's finest new bands is not included in the nominations .
charlie bones , uk obviously joanna macgregor has bags of talent and deserves an award for bucking the trend in the classical genre and seeking to promote and introduce a wide-variety of lesser known compositions , rather than re-hash the well-known ones - classic fm style .
she even set up her own record label .
however , joanna macgregor ¿ s never gonna win - it 's a token gesture , particularly as the record companies can ¿ t make any money out of her !
tim , uk as the mercury prize has been going a few years now , its time to decide about the obviously token classical and jazz nominations .
as it 's a relatively weak year in rock / pop , it could be a good chance to give it to guy barker .
not the best jazz album of the year , but definitely worthy of acclaim .
bowie , god bless you maam , my personal favourite of the list , but probably does n't need the gong .
of the rest , the streets are riding the zeitgeist , but the music is not the most inspiring .
in summary , i think the gong should go to bev knight , so all the quality acts are treated fairly and the mercury prize can retain its spirit of contrariness .
giles , england great to see the mercury list again this year - the highlight of the music awards .
of the ones i 've heard i love most of them , the ones i have n't heard - well , the mercury just makes me wanna go out and hear ' em .
of course we are all gonna hate one or two of them - that 's the idea , a diverse range of music .
i would hate it if i liked them all - ' cos then it would just be pop , would n't it ?
robson robstar , england i think the streets is getting a bit of a hard review from people .
yes , it touches on the cringeworthy , but it does present some more interesting points of view -lrb- that people may not always appreciate -rrb- , and i think there is creativity in there that warrants nomination .
however , it is with out a shadow of a doubt , in my opinion , that doves should win .
both their albums have shown the world that guitars and decent production can go together to create music that breaks through the usual din of many of today 's new bands , and i believe they still lead the pack in " creativity and artistic credibility " .
to those who complain that the nominations are too guitar based , i would say there are two reasons for that ... 1 -rrb- there has been way too much garage , r 'n'b and rubbish like of that type recently , that the judges will never be able to battle through the tripe to the beef -lrb- if there is any -rrb- within 12 months and 2 -rrb- to make music with an instrument relies on passion and not just creativity .
anyone can press a key . see ?
the only feeling there is at the end of my finger !
mezza , uk i ca n't stand garage music , but the streets prove that its originality and quality that counts , not genre .
will he be making good music in 30 years ?
who cares , this is a great album .
joseph , england if the bees do n't win this i 'll eat my mother .
kerry jarman , uk the bees ?
what ?
there are thousands of bands at this level .
this smacks of backhanders .
they 're good but not that good .
for god 's sake !
however take roots manuva who has made two exceptional albums seeping originality that does n't deny where it comes from in the world .
this music is progressing forward not looking back .
let 's think about this .

the animals have unearthed the remains of a rare glass window which once adorned a 14th century manor house at a secret location in warwickshire .
the rabbits burrowed into what appeared to be a grass covered hump and uncovered a quanity of medieval glass .
conservation experts are now attempting to preserve the glass before it deteriorates after being exposed to air .
rabbits ' warren english heritage 's ancient monuments inspector for the west midlands , dr paul stamper , said the creatures had burrowed into the base of the moated house .
" normally windows would have been removed and used elsewhere but in this case it looks as though the window was simply left on the site and became incorporated into the rabbits ' warren , " he said .
" over the years , as the rabbits have done their own home improvement work , the glass , shards of pottery and fragments of animal bone have been kicked out of their burrow . "
the 14th century moated manor house was flattened in the 15th century when the family built a bigger home nearby and found the original house spoiled their view .
different patterns tests are now being conducted on the glass to reveal its manufacturing process and then experts may be able to get an idea of the pictures painted on the window .
" so far we can only make out scriptwork and different patterns , " dr stamper continued .
" we have to act fast because once the glass is exposed to the air it soon begins to deteriorate .
" it is a race against time to preserve it before the beautiful designs are lost forever . "

the annual underlying rate of inflation rose by half a percentage point last month to 2 % , official figures showed on tuesday .
i think we 've got rates at 4 % until something changes geoffrey dicks royal bank of scotland but it was still well below the bank of england 's target rate of 2.5 % , with 1 % leeway either way .
the headline rate of inflation , which includes mortgage interest payments , also rose half a percentage point to 1.5 % , the office for national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- said .
but it warned that the data could have been distorted upwards by the effect of the queen 's golden jubilee celebrations and the world cup , which meant that some summer sales started in june instead of july .
rates on hold the ons said a key reason for the rise was smaller falls in food prices , particularly seasonal food .
price changes for furniture , housing costs and car tax and insurance also helped drive inflation higher .
geoffrey dicks , an economist at the royal bank of scotland , said the rise in inflation did not change the picture because july 's figure was still below the inflation target .
" i think we 've got rates at 4 % until something changes , " he said .
the case for a cut figures from the british retail consortium late on monday showed that the rate of spending on the uk 's high streets slowed last month .
the brc said that retail sales in july rose by 3.8 % compared with last year , but were down from 4 % in june and far lower than the 7.5 % growth rate achieved in march .

" that is what kept the economy going in the last 12 to 15 months or so and it would be a great mistake to dampen down consumer demand too quickly . "
end of retail boom the brc said some retailers saw mixed results because the timing of the summer sales varied compared with a year earlier .
customers were reported to have taken advantage of the summer sales , as the hot spell of weather gave stores a chance to promote summer fashions after a wet june .
clothing performed well but sales of groceries and home wares proved sluggish , according to the brc .
bridget roswell , chief economic adviser to the brc , pointed out that july 's sales growth was weaker than any month last year .
