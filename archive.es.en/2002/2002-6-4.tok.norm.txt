so , the perfect parade for england 's party queen ? at a thanksgiving service held at st. paul 's cathedral the archbishop of canterbury , dr george carey , spoke of queen elizabeth 's ' dedication ' and ' steadfastness ' .
comments that the british weekly the economist must have been thinking of when it criticised ' this sycophantic guff ' , saying it reflected widespread ignorance about what the queen had actually done during her 50-year reign .
the last few days have seen an upsurge in british royalist fervor .
but less than a million people flocked to the center of the british capital on tuesday , the last of four days of celebrations , to wave at the queen and the duke of edinburgh on their way to st. paul 's from buckingham palace .
it was less than the million who tuned in to watch monday night 's pop and rock concert on the grounds of the palace .
moved to smile as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth 's teeth the queen was moved , she said , by the public 's huge show of support , thanking her so-called subjects for coming together in celebration of an " up and down " 50 years on the throne .
while a 41-gun salute was fired , and trumpets played , she graced the crowds with the same fixed smile she has worn for the best part of half a century .
tagging along was the rest of the family , including prince andrew , prince william and harry , princess beatrice and eugenie , the earl and countess of wessex .
the princess royal and the prince of wales brought up the rear on horseback .
the family has been the source of much embarrassment of late , adding to the public agony of a reputation hard hit since the queen 's silver jubilee in 1977 - incidentally , the same year british punk band the sex pistols released the royal-bating " god save the queen " .
they , too , have a jubilee to celebrate . the 76-year-old monarch has seen her popularity slip and her role questioned .
one scandal has followed the other , with infidelities , blundering racist commentary and dope-smoking royal adolescents grabbing headlines around the world .
all quiet on the caribbean front on the former british colony barbados , the jubilee has received little fanfare .
the high commission was closed for celebrations , but the island which was once known as " little england " saw no parties or flag-waving .
only a cool " congratulations on your golden jubilee " was offered in the nation newspaper on sunday .
the country thought in the past to be more english than england has been independent since 1966 .
but while other commonwealth nations like zimbabwe and australia continue to consider breaking away from the pack , it seems that the british might never let go . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the royal family : past , present - future ?

in the end , the government said it chose to enter into a cooperative agreement with ibm in order to save money and increase security .
" we 're increasing our it security by avoiding monocultures , " federal interior minister otto schily told reporters .

back in february , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , decided to provide its elected officials with a choice of linux or windows operating systems on their computers starting in 2003 .
democracy in action the idealistic possibilities of using an open-source system led to a large political debate over whether the government should use linux or microsoft .

in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system . tux the penguin is invading germany .
no , the south pole creatures at the berlin zoo have n't escaped .
the bird behind this feathery technology attack is the coat-and-tie clad mascot for the computer operating system linux .
the german government said on monday it had reached a deal with software giant ibm to deploy linux software at all government agencies .
saving money , increasing security the move came as a serious blow to microsoft , which had hired a small army of lobbyists in an attempt to sway berlin in its direction .
in the end , the government said it chose to enter into a cooperative agreement with ibm in order to save money and increase security .
" we 're increasing our it security by avoiding monocultures , " federal interior minister otto schily told reporters .
" we 're reducing our independence on individual suppliers and we 're saving money on software purchases and overhead . "
in the wake of september 11 , increasing domestic security has been a top priority for schily .
shortly after the terrorist attacks , he began meeting with information technology leaders in the public and private sector to find new security solutions .
the deal with ibm and the shift away from microsoft came as a part of that work .
though linux is an open-source operating system - meaning it can be downloaded and operated free of charge - the german government has contracted with ibm to provide consulting and services related to its deployment .

the american , chinese and french governments have deployed linux as a standard operating system in certain ministries .

however , many organizations are content with purchasing upgrades every few years and fear that the new model will cause it budgets to rocket .
one reason for the government 's decision to go with linux is that the operating system will make it easier for agencies to create their own applications .
interior minister schily said program codes could then be posted publicly to help find errors or suggestions for improvement within the enormous and global open-source software movement .
information technology departments at european universities , which lack commercial interests , could also be tapped to develop software for government enterprises .
back in february , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , decided to provide its elected officials with a choice of linux or windows operating systems on their computers starting in 2003 .
democracy in action the idealistic possibilities of using an open-source system led to a large political debate over whether the government should use linux or microsoft .
many politicians saw linux as a more democratic option that would spur competition in a landscape where microsoft controls the desktops of 90 percent of the government 's computers .
champions of linux even started their own online petition earlier this year called " bundestux : penguins for office . "
in a text appearing on the site , they drew the political battle lines .
" the democratic component is not simply in the increased security and flexibility of the software , " the proponents argued , " but is more the expression of a broad democratic understanding that encompasses economic and technological developments .
based on these considerations it is plainly the duty of a democratic state to choose free software . "
microsoft , however , felt broadsided by the campaign .
at the time , microsoft germany 's chief , kurt sibold , accused the signatories of conducting a biased political campaign .
" what you are achieving by supporting this campaign is public discrimination , accusing our products and services of being undemocratic and an obstacle to democracy , " he wrote .

back in february , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , decided to provide its elected officials with a choice of linux or windows operating systems on their computers starting in 2003 .
democracy in action the idealistic possibilities of using an open-source system led to a large political debate over whether the government should use linux or microsoft .
many politicians saw linux as a more democratic option that would spur competition in a landscape where microsoft controls the desktops of 90 percent of the government 's computers .
champions of linux even started their own online petition earlier this year called " bundestux : penguins for office . "
in a text appearing on the site , they drew the political battle lines .
" the democratic component is not simply in the increased security and flexibility of the software , " the proponents argued , " but is more the expression of a broad democratic understanding that encompasses economic and technological developments .
based on these considerations it is plainly the duty of a democratic state to choose free software . "
microsoft , however , felt broadsided by the campaign .
at the time , microsoft germany 's chief , kurt sibold , accused the signatories of conducting a biased political campaign .
" what you are achieving by supporting this campaign is public discrimination , accusing our products and services of being undemocratic and an obstacle to democracy , " he wrote .
now , as the number of government computers with windows and linux increases , politicians will be able to make their own decisions about which platform is better .
it is clear that , in the end , either tux the penguin or bill gates will prevail . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links bundestux : penguins for office more information on the campaign to deploy linux instead of microsoft within the german government .

in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system . tux the penguin is invading germany .
no , the south pole creatures at the berlin zoo have n't escaped .
the bird behind this feathery technology attack is the coat-and-tie clad mascot for the computer operating system linux .
the german government said on monday it had reached a deal with software giant ibm to deploy linux software at all government agencies .
saving money , increasing security the move came as a serious blow to microsoft , which had hired a small army of lobbyists in an attempt to sway berlin in its direction .
in the end , the government said it chose to enter into a cooperative agreement with ibm in order to save money and increase security .
" we 're increasing our it security by avoiding monocultures , " federal interior minister otto schily told reporters .
" we 're reducing our independence on individual suppliers and we 're saving money on software purchases and overhead . "
in the wake of september 11 , increasing domestic security has been a top priority for schily .
shortly after the terrorist attacks , he began meeting with information technology leaders in the public and private sector to find new security solutions .
the deal with ibm and the shift away from microsoft came as a part of that work .
though linux is an open-source operating system - meaning it can be downloaded and operated free of charge - the german government has contracted with ibm to provide consulting and services related to its deployment .
a growing trend in switching to linux , the german government is joining a growing global trend .
the american , chinese and french governments have deployed linux as a standard operating system in certain ministries .
it also comes at a time when microsoft is planning a controversial restructuring of its pricing .
beginning in july , the company is seeking to charge an annual subscription fee to corporate and government users instead of a one-time fee for each version of a software product .
however , many organizations are content with purchasing upgrades every few years and fear that the new model will cause it budgets to rocket .
one reason for the government 's decision to go with linux is that the operating system will make it easier for agencies to create their own applications .
interior minister schily said program codes could then be posted publicly to help find errors or suggestions for improvement within the enormous and global open-source software movement .
information technology departments at european universities , which lack commercial interests , could also be tapped to develop software for government enterprises .
back in february , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , decided to provide its elected officials with a choice of linux or windows operating systems on their computers starting in 2003 .
democracy in action the idealistic possibilities of using an open-source system led to a large political debate over whether the government should use linux or microsoft .
many politicians saw linux as a more democratic option that would spur competition in a landscape where microsoft controls the desktops of 90 percent of the government 's computers .
champions of linux even started their own online petition earlier this year called " bundestux : penguins for office . "
in a text appearing on the site , they drew the political battle lines .

"
in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system . tux the penguin is invading germany .
no , the south pole creatures at the berlin zoo have n't escaped .
the bird behind this feathery technology attack is the coat-and-tie clad mascot for the computer operating system linux .
the german government said on monday it had reached a deal with software giant ibm to deploy linux software at all government agencies .
saving money , increasing security the move came as a serious blow to microsoft , which had hired a small army of lobbyists in an attempt to sway berlin in its direction .
in the end , the government said it chose to enter into a cooperative agreement with ibm in order to save money and increase security .
" we 're increasing our it security by avoiding monocultures , " federal interior minister otto schily told reporters .
" we 're reducing our independence on individual suppliers and we 're saving money on software purchases and overhead . "
in the wake of september 11 , increasing domestic security has been a top priority for schily .
shortly after the terrorist attacks , he began meeting with information technology leaders in the public and private sector to find new security solutions .
the deal with ibm and the shift away from microsoft came as a part of that work .
though linux is an open-source operating system - meaning it can be downloaded and operated free of charge - the german government has contracted with ibm to provide consulting and services related to its deployment .
a growing trend in switching to linux , the german government is joining a growing global trend .
the american , chinese and french governments have deployed linux as a standard operating system in certain ministries .
it also comes at a time when microsoft is planning a controversial restructuring of its pricing .
beginning in july , the company is seeking to charge an annual subscription fee to corporate and government users instead of a one-time fee for each version of a software product .
however , many organizations are content with purchasing upgrades every few years and fear that the new model will cause it budgets to rocket .
one reason for the government 's decision to go with linux is that the operating system will make it easier for agencies to create their own applications .
interior minister schily said program codes could then be posted publicly to help find errors or suggestions for improvement within the enormous and global open-source software movement .
information technology departments at european universities , which lack commercial interests , could also be tapped to develop software for government enterprises .
back in february , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , decided to provide its elected officials with a choice of linux or windows operating systems on their computers starting in 2003 .
democracy in action the idealistic possibilities of using an open-source system led to a large political debate over whether the government should use linux or microsoft .
many politicians saw linux as a more democratic option that would spur competition in a landscape where microsoft controls the desktops of 90 percent of the government 's computers .
champions of linux even started their own online petition earlier this year called " bundestux : penguins for office . "
in a text appearing on the site , they drew the political battle lines .
" the democratic component is not simply in the increased security and flexibility of the software , " the proponents argued , " but is more the expression of a broad democratic understanding that encompasses economic and technological developments .
based on these considerations it is plainly the duty of a democratic state to choose free software . "
microsoft , however , felt broadsided by the campaign .
at the time , microsoft germany 's chief , kurt sibold , accused the signatories of conducting a biased political campaign .
" what you are achieving by supporting this campaign is public discrimination , accusing our products and services of being undemocratic and an obstacle to democracy , " he wrote .

"
in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system . tux the penguin is invading germany .
no , the south pole creatures at the berlin zoo have n't escaped .
the bird behind this feathery technology attack is the coat-and-tie clad mascot for the computer operating system linux .
the german government said on monday it had reached a deal with software giant ibm to deploy linux software at all government agencies .
saving money , increasing security the move came as a serious blow to microsoft , which had hired a small army of lobbyists in an attempt to sway berlin in its direction .
in the end , the government said it chose to enter into a cooperative agreement with ibm in order to save money and increase security .
" we 're increasing our it security by avoiding monocultures , " federal interior minister otto schily told reporters .
" we 're reducing our independence on individual suppliers and we 're saving money on software purchases and overhead . "

so , the perfect parade for england 's party queen ? at a thanksgiving service held at st. paul 's cathedral the archbishop of canterbury , dr george carey , spoke of queen elizabeth 's ' dedication ' and ' steadfastness ' .
comments that the british weekly the economist must have been thinking of when it criticised ' this sycophantic guff ' , saying it reflected widespread ignorance about what the queen had actually done during her 50-year reign .
the last few days have seen an upsurge in british royalist fervor .
but less than a million people flocked to the center of the british capital on tuesday , the last of four days of celebrations , to wave at the queen and the duke of edinburgh on their way to st. paul 's from buckingham palace .
it was less than the million who tuned in to watch monday night 's pop and rock concert on the grounds of the palace .

while a 41-gun salute was fired , and trumpets played , she graced the crowds with the same fixed smile she has worn for the best part of half a century .
tagging along was the rest of the family , including prince andrew , prince william and harry , princess beatrice and eugenie , the earl and countess of wessex .
the princess royal and the prince of wales brought up the rear on horseback .
the family has been the source of much embarrassment of late , adding to the public agony of a reputation hard hit since the queen 's silver jubilee in 1977 - incidentally , the same year british punk band the sex pistols released the royal-bating " god save the queen " .
they , too , have a jubilee to celebrate . the 76-year-old monarch has seen her popularity slip and her role questioned .
one scandal has followed the other , with infidelities , blundering racist commentary and dope-smoking royal adolescents grabbing headlines around the world .
all quiet on the caribbean front on the former british colony barbados , the jubilee has received little fanfare .
the high commission was closed for celebrations , but the island which was once known as " little england " saw no parties or flag-waving .
only a cool " congratulations on your golden jubilee " was offered in the nation newspaper on sunday .
the country thought in the past to be more english than england has been independent since 1966 .

"
in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system . tux the penguin is invading germany .
no , the south pole creatures at the berlin zoo have n't escaped .
the bird behind this feathery technology attack is the coat-and-tie clad mascot for the computer operating system linux .
the german government said on monday it had reached a deal with software giant ibm to deploy linux software at all government agencies .
saving money , increasing security the move came as a serious blow to microsoft , which had hired a small army of lobbyists in an attempt to sway berlin in its direction .
in the end , the government said it chose to enter into a cooperative agreement with ibm in order to save money and increase security .
" we 're increasing our it security by avoiding monocultures , " federal interior minister otto schily told reporters .
" we 're reducing our independence on individual suppliers and we 're saving money on software purchases and overhead . "
in the wake of september 11 , increasing domestic security has been a top priority for schily .
shortly after the terrorist attacks , he began meeting with information technology leaders in the public and private sector to find new security solutions .
the deal with ibm and the shift away from microsoft came as a part of that work .
though linux is an open-source operating system - meaning it can be downloaded and operated free of charge - the german government has contracted with ibm to provide consulting and services related to its deployment .
a growing trend in switching to linux , the german government is joining a growing global trend .
the american , chinese and french governments have deployed linux as a standard operating system in certain ministries .
it also comes at a time when microsoft is planning a controversial restructuring of its pricing .
beginning in july , the company is seeking to charge an annual subscription fee to corporate and government users instead of a one-time fee for each version of a software product .
however , many organizations are content with purchasing upgrades every few years and fear that the new model will cause it budgets to rocket .
one reason for the government 's decision to go with linux is that the operating system will make it easier for agencies to create their own applications .
interior minister schily said program codes could then be posted publicly to help find errors or suggestions for improvement within the enormous and global open-source software movement .
information technology departments at european universities , which lack commercial interests , could also be tapped to develop software for government enterprises .
back in february , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , decided to provide its elected officials with a choice of linux or windows operating systems on their computers starting in 2003 .
democracy in action the idealistic possibilities of using an open-source system led to a large political debate over whether the government should use linux or microsoft .
many politicians saw linux as a more democratic option that would spur competition in a landscape where microsoft controls the desktops of 90 percent of the government 's computers .
champions of linux even started their own online petition earlier this year called " bundestux : penguins for office . "
in a text appearing on the site , they drew the political battle lines .
" the democratic component is not simply in the increased security and flexibility of the software , " the proponents argued , " but is more the expression of a broad democratic understanding that encompasses economic and technological developments .
based on these considerations it is plainly the duty of a democratic state to choose free software . "
microsoft , however , felt broadsided by the campaign .
at the time , microsoft germany 's chief , kurt sibold , accused the signatories of conducting a biased political campaign .
" what you are achieving by supporting this campaign is public discrimination , accusing our products and services of being undemocratic and an obstacle to democracy , " he wrote .

so , the perfect parade for england 's party queen ? at a thanksgiving service held at st. paul 's cathedral the archbishop of canterbury , dr george carey , spoke of queen elizabeth 's ' dedication ' and ' steadfastness ' .
comments that the british weekly the economist must have been thinking of when it criticised ' this sycophantic guff ' , saying it reflected widespread ignorance about what the queen had actually done during her 50-year reign .
the last few days have seen an upsurge in british royalist fervor .
but less than a million people flocked to the center of the british capital on tuesday , the last of four days of celebrations , to wave at the queen and the duke of edinburgh on their way to st. paul 's from buckingham palace .
it was less than the million who tuned in to watch monday night 's pop and rock concert on the grounds of the palace .
moved to smile as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth 's teeth the queen was moved , she said , by the public 's huge show of support , thanking her so-called subjects for coming together in celebration of an " up and down " 50 years on the throne .
while a 41-gun salute was fired , and trumpets played , she graced the crowds with the same fixed smile she has worn for the best part of half a century .
tagging along was the rest of the family , including prince andrew , prince william and harry , princess beatrice and eugenie , the earl and countess of wessex .
the princess royal and the prince of wales brought up the rear on horseback .
the family has been the source of much embarrassment of late , adding to the public agony of a reputation hard hit since the queen 's silver jubilee in 1977 - incidentally , the same year british punk band the sex pistols released the royal-bating " god save the queen " .
they , too , have a jubilee to celebrate . the 76-year-old monarch has seen her popularity slip and her role questioned .
one scandal has followed the other , with infidelities , blundering racist commentary and dope-smoking royal adolescents grabbing headlines around the world .
all quiet on the caribbean front on the former british colony barbados , the jubilee has received little fanfare .
the high commission was closed for celebrations , but the island which was once known as " little england " saw no parties or flag-waving .
only a cool " congratulations on your golden jubilee " was offered in the nation newspaper on sunday .

"
in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system . tux the penguin is invading germany .
no , the south pole creatures at the berlin zoo have n't escaped .
the bird behind this feathery technology attack is the coat-and-tie clad mascot for the computer operating system linux .
the german government said on monday it had reached a deal with software giant ibm to deploy linux software at all government agencies .
saving money , increasing security the move came as a serious blow to microsoft , which had hired a small army of lobbyists in an attempt to sway berlin in its direction .
in the end , the government said it chose to enter into a cooperative agreement with ibm in order to save money and increase security .
" we 're increasing our it security by avoiding monocultures , " federal interior minister otto schily told reporters .
" we 're reducing our independence on individual suppliers and we 're saving money on software purchases and overhead . "
in the wake of september 11 , increasing domestic security has been a top priority for schily .
shortly after the terrorist attacks , he began meeting with information technology leaders in the public and private sector to find new security solutions .
the deal with ibm and the shift away from microsoft came as a part of that work .
though linux is an open-source operating system - meaning it can be downloaded and operated free of charge - the german government has contracted with ibm to provide consulting and services related to its deployment .
a growing trend in switching to linux , the german government is joining a growing global trend .
the american , chinese and french governments have deployed linux as a standard operating system in certain ministries .
it also comes at a time when microsoft is planning a controversial restructuring of its pricing .
beginning in july , the company is seeking to charge an annual subscription fee to corporate and government users instead of a one-time fee for each version of a software product .
however , many organizations are content with purchasing upgrades every few years and fear that the new model will cause it budgets to rocket .
one reason for the government 's decision to go with linux is that the operating system will make it easier for agencies to create their own applications .
interior minister schily said program codes could then be posted publicly to help find errors or suggestions for improvement within the enormous and global open-source software movement .
information technology departments at european universities , which lack commercial interests , could also be tapped to develop software for government enterprises .
back in february , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , decided to provide its elected officials with a choice of linux or windows operating systems on their computers starting in 2003 .
democracy in action the idealistic possibilities of using an open-source system led to a large political debate over whether the government should use linux or microsoft .
many politicians saw linux as a more democratic option that would spur competition in a landscape where microsoft controls the desktops of 90 percent of the government 's computers .
champions of linux even started their own online petition earlier this year called " bundestux : penguins for office . "
in a text appearing on the site , they drew the political battle lines .
" the democratic component is not simply in the increased security and flexibility of the software , " the proponents argued , " but is more the expression of a broad democratic understanding that encompasses economic and technological developments .
based on these considerations it is plainly the duty of a democratic state to choose free software . "
microsoft , however , felt broadsided by the campaign .
at the time , microsoft germany 's chief , kurt sibold , accused the signatories of conducting a biased political campaign .
" what you are achieving by supporting this campaign is public discrimination , accusing our products and services of being undemocratic and an obstacle to democracy , " he wrote .

"
in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system . tux the penguin is invading germany .
no , the south pole creatures at the berlin zoo have n't escaped .
the bird behind this feathery technology attack is the coat-and-tie clad mascot for the computer operating system linux .
the german government said on monday it had reached a deal with software giant ibm to deploy linux software at all government agencies .
saving money , increasing security the move came as a serious blow to microsoft , which had hired a small army of lobbyists in an attempt to sway berlin in its direction .
in the end , the government said it chose to enter into a cooperative agreement with ibm in order to save money and increase security .
" we 're increasing our it security by avoiding monocultures , " federal interior minister otto schily told reporters .
" we 're reducing our independence on individual suppliers and we 're saving money on software purchases and overhead . "
in the wake of september 11 , increasing domestic security has been a top priority for schily .
shortly after the terrorist attacks , he began meeting with information technology leaders in the public and private sector to find new security solutions .
the deal with ibm and the shift away from microsoft came as a part of that work .
though linux is an open-source operating system - meaning it can be downloaded and operated free of charge - the german government has contracted with ibm to provide consulting and services related to its deployment .
a growing trend in switching to linux , the german government is joining a growing global trend .
the american , chinese and french governments have deployed linux as a standard operating system in certain ministries .
it also comes at a time when microsoft is planning a controversial restructuring of its pricing .
beginning in july , the company is seeking to charge an annual subscription fee to corporate and government users instead of a one-time fee for each version of a software product .
however , many organizations are content with purchasing upgrades every few years and fear that the new model will cause it budgets to rocket .
one reason for the government 's decision to go with linux is that the operating system will make it easier for agencies to create their own applications .
interior minister schily said program codes could then be posted publicly to help find errors or suggestions for improvement within the enormous and global open-source software movement .
information technology departments at european universities , which lack commercial interests , could also be tapped to develop software for government enterprises .
back in february , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , decided to provide its elected officials with a choice of linux or windows operating systems on their computers starting in 2003 .
democracy in action the idealistic possibilities of using an open-source system led to a large political debate over whether the government should use linux or microsoft .
many politicians saw linux as a more democratic option that would spur competition in a landscape where microsoft controls the desktops of 90 percent of the government 's computers .
champions of linux even started their own online petition earlier this year called " bundestux : penguins for office . "
in a text appearing on the site , they drew the political battle lines .
" the democratic component is not simply in the increased security and flexibility of the software , " the proponents argued , " but is more the expression of a broad democratic understanding that encompasses economic and technological developments .
based on these considerations it is plainly the duty of a democratic state to choose free software . "
microsoft , however , felt broadsided by the campaign .
at the time , microsoft germany 's chief , kurt sibold , accused the signatories of conducting a biased political campaign .
" what you are achieving by supporting this campaign is public discrimination , accusing our products and services of being undemocratic and an obstacle to democracy , " he wrote .
now , as the number of government computers with windows and linux increases , politicians will be able to make their own decisions about which platform is better .

the documents detail the contact between enron officials and the bush administration as the scandal unfolded .
a us senate committee voted to subpoena documents on the white house 's links with enron last month .
but the white house is refusing to hand the documents over physically until an agreement is made to restrict their release to the public .
no instance of wrong doing by anyone in the white house has been found so far .
security measures the role of the bush administration , which is renowned for its close links with energy firms , has come under close scrutiny since the collapse of enron .
the subpoena came after senator joseph lieberman said the white house had not responded quickly enough to requests for information .
the white house insisted the subpoena was " unnecessary " , and would make the appropriate material available in due course .
it has now made documents available for inspection within the white house complex .
but it is refusing to provide copies of the documents until an agreement is made to safeguard the security and confidentiality of the documents .
campaign contributions enron , one of the us ' most high-profile corporate success stories of the 1990s , filed for bankruptcy protection late last year after it emerged it had hidden millions of dollars in debt using a complex series of external financial partnerships .
enron 's bankruptcy , the biggest in us corporate history , left investors nursing heavy losses and wiped out many former enron employees ' retirement savings .
the company was a major donor to president george w. bush 's 2000 presidential campaign , and was one of a small group of energy companies thought to have been behind much of the administration 's energy policy .
the bush administration , known for its ties with the energy industry , has admitted that enron chairman kenneth lay made phone calls to senior government officials late last year as the company neared bankruptcy .
fall-out enron 's collapse sent shock waves through us financial markets , with investors dumping shares in any company using less than transparent accounting procedures .
another strand of the multiple investigations has focused on why federal regulators did not detect the company 's irregular financial practices sooner .

the documents detail the contact between enron officials and the bush administration as the scandal unfolded .
a us senate committee voted to subpoena documents on the white house 's links with enron last month .
but the white house is refusing to hand the documents over physically until an agreement is made to restrict their release to the public .
no instance of wrong doing by anyone in the white house has been found so far .
security measures the role of the bush administration , which is renowned for its close links with energy firms , has come under close scrutiny since the collapse of enron .
the subpoena came after senator joseph lieberman said the white house had not responded quickly enough to requests for information .
the white house insisted the subpoena was " unnecessary " , and would make the appropriate material available in due course .
it has now made documents available for inspection within the white house complex .
but it is refusing to provide copies of the documents until an agreement is made to safeguard the security and confidentiality of the documents .
campaign contributions enron , one of the us ' most high-profile corporate success stories of the 1990s , filed for bankruptcy protection late last year after it emerged it had hidden millions of dollars in debt using a complex series of external financial partnerships .
enron 's bankruptcy , the biggest in us corporate history , left investors nursing heavy losses and wiped out many former enron employees ' retirement savings .
the company was a major donor to president george w. bush 's 2000 presidential campaign , and was one of a small group of energy companies thought to have been behind much of the administration 's energy policy .
the bush administration , known for its ties with the energy industry , has admitted that enron chairman kenneth lay made phone calls to senior government officials late last year as the company neared bankruptcy .
fall-out enron 's collapse sent shock waves through us financial markets , with investors dumping shares in any company using less than transparent accounting procedures .
another strand of the multiple investigations has focused on why federal regulators did not detect the company 's irregular financial practices sooner .
it has also destroyed the reputation of the global accounting giant andersen , which had failed to spot any irregularities while auditing enron 's accounts .
andersen 's us audit partnership is currently defending itself against criminal charges stemming from the destruction of enron-related documents by some of its executives .

the news increased investor fears over financial wrongdoing at the company , and tyco stock plunged by 27 % during the day 's trading .
the company said on monday that mr kozlowski was stepping down for " personal reasons " , and later stressed that the probe was on a personal rather than a corporate level .
mr kozlowski , a former accountant , is to be replaced by tyco board member and previous chief executive john fort .
" during his tenure , dennis kozlowski grew tyco to a $ 36bn dollar manufacturer and service provider operating in over 100 countries , " mr fort said in a statement .
" we wish him well and thank him for his contributions . "
bowing out mr kozlowski , who ran tyco for nearly ten years , is credited with transforming the company from a small manufacturing firm into an industrial giant with interests ranging from fire alarms to medical equipment .
but his strategy of aggressive acquisition-led growth fell out of favour earlier this year amid mounting concerns that the company 's complex structure could be masking its true financial position .
tyco shares have lost about two thirds of their value since the beginning of the year .
the collapse late last year of us energy trading giant enron , which concealed hefty debts using a series of external partnerships , has heightened investor concerns over the transparency of corporate earnings statements .
investor confidence received a further dent in april when tyco reported a hefty first-quarter loss , and scrapped plans to split into four separate companies . watch / listen on this story bill symonds , business week " one of his nicknames was deal-a-day dennis . "

relatives of the 225 people who died when flight ci 611 plunged into the sea off the island of penghu on 25 may desperately want to know the cause of the crash .
but officials from taiwan 's aviation safety council -lrb- asc -rrb- , which is investigating the incident , have so far been unable to draw any firm conclusions .
the recovery operation could take months asc investigator phil tai said : " we are still at the recovery stage .
only when we 've got more evidence can we start to look at the cause of the crash . "
the recovery of wreckage has been focused on an area of sea about 12 nautical miles north of penghu , where the plane 's two " black boxes " - voice and flight data recorders - and parts of the fuselage were located .
experts , including deep-sea recovery specialists from american underwater search and survey ltd , have been using an underwater camera attached to a remote-controlled vehicle to pin-point pieces of the airliner .
a crane mounted on a barge is on stand-by to lift wreckage to the surface , although this operation has been hampered by rough seas in the taiwan strait .
expert help once individual pieces have been collected , they are being taken to a hanger at makung air force base , on penghu , where they are analysed by an asc team .
officials will number each piece and then try to work out which part of the boeing 747-200 it came from .
taiwanese military officials quickly moved to quell speculation that the aircraft had been hit by a missile this will be a slow process .
more than a week after the crash , investigators had recovered about 400 individual pieces , but they amounted to less than 1 % of the plane .
investigator tai said : " the cause of the crash is still unknown so it 's important we do n't lose any evidence or any piece of wreckage . "
helping the taiwanese team are officials from the us national transportation safety board and the federal aviation administration .
two boeing officials , one structural expert and an accident investigator , are also helping to sift through the evidence after being invited to join the recovery efforts .
crash theories as well as searching for parts of the airliner , which crashed about 20 minutes into a flight from taipei to hong kong , investigators are also looking at other evidence for the possible cause of the crash .
china has provided radar data to help investigators check the course of the 23-year-old aircraft during its last few minutes .
and a special team of police officers is looking into the backgrounds of all passengers and crew members to see if they had any reason to cause the crash .
officers are checking their insurance status , family members and their activities just before the crash happened .
companies that had cargo on the plane are also being screened .
early on investigators ruled out bad weather as a cause of the crash after checking conditions at the time of the accident .
taiwanese military officials also quickly moved to quell speculation that the aircraft had been hit by a missile fired by either themselves or china .
but so far there are not many certainties .
one of the few things the asc will say is that the plane broke up more than 30,000 feet , with parts flying off in four separate directions .
needing answers boeing spokeswoman liz verdier said investigations like this often took a long time .
" people want , and society expects , quick answers , " she said .
" but there wo n't be answers that quickly because aircraft are complicated machines and we have to make sure we get the right answers . "
it took seven months to find 80 % of the wreckage of a twa boeing 747-100 that crashed off the coast of long island , new york , in 1996 , and four years before the final report into the crash was released .
according to the tzu chi buddhist foundation , which is helping to comfort relatives , some victims ' families have stopped holding a grudge against china airlines and the government over the crash , although many bodies have still not been recovered .
its volunteers said many relatives had expressed their gratitude to the rescue teams by writing thank-you letters and visiting them in person .
even so , they will be hoping investigators discover the cause of the crash sooner rather than later .
