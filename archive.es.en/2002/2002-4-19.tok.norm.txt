some reports say they embraced , others that they shook hands , but that marc ravalomanana and didier ratsiraka met at all , never mind came up with a piece of paper they could both sign , owes as much to the seriousness of the situation as to the hard work of a small group of african leaders .
ravalomanana has done well out of the deal the country 's economy is in freefall - some say that for every day the crisis continues , the island 's once promising economic growth is put back a month .
the capital , antananarivo , is short of fuel , medicines and bread .
at least 35 people have been killed and many more injured , as the squabbling for power in the provinces is increasingly turning violent .

unanswered questions but what of the deal done so many miles away in senegal that appears to offer a solution to an incredibly complex crisis ?
there are scant details and plenty of question marks .
first , there will be a recount of the december presidential election after the country 's supreme court this week rejected the high constitutional court 's results - a body it says was unlawfully reshuffled just before the vote .
ratsiraka may be able to retire gracefully that is what the people have been demanding , ever since hundreds of thousands of them took to the streets of antananarivo in january .
they have their " confrontation " , but how can anyone on either side trust a recount , months after an election , amid claims of fraud and ballot rigging ?
so if the new result is inconclusive , it goes to a referendum " in which the people will choose between the two candidates " .
this is what marc ravalomanana has said he is prepared to do to legitimise power .
and in the six months it might take , he will be the second highest state official , run the council that runs the government of national reconciliation and choose the interior and finance ministers .
he has done very well out of the deal , but will not be able to call himself president anymore - something his supporters had become accustomed to doing .
and what about his newly appointed government ministers ?
promises , promises then there are the blockades which are isolating antananarivo .
didier ratsiraka 's supporters have been starving the city for months and it has been a very successful policy .
from his enclave in the port town of tamatave , this would appear to be his last big bargaining chip ; it seems unlikely he would just throw it away , especially as mr ravalomanana has shored up support in a second province , fianarantsoa .
and anyway , do the two leaders still have the power necessary to stop the violence and the assassinations , or is the chaos the situation has created now in charge ?
few doubt that mr ratsiraka is finished - this deal could offer him a graceful way to retire .
the plan has some good ideas and times are hard for malagasy people - they may welcome it as the best way to resolve the crisis .
but nothing is ever simple in madagascar - the dakar accord is a series of promises , without the nitty-gritty of how they will be kept .

he looked younger than he has for years as he stepped off the italian military plane at kabul airport , escorted by the afghan interim leader , hamid karzai .
he spent a few minutes greeting ministers and delegations from across the country , shaking hands and smiling , before being ushered away to his new home by aides fearful that he might overextend himself . "
now we will be at peace again - for evermore " nafisa nazeera zahir shah will find kabul a city ruined and shattered by war .
since he was forced to abdicate by his cousin , daoud , in 1973 , afghanistan has suffered coups , occupation and bloodshed .
no wonder many afghans look back at his 40 year long reign as a golden era .
" this is a day of great happiness , the best day , " said nafisa nazeera , one of the delegates from the women 's affairs ministry .
" now we will be at peace again - for evermore . "
ministers absent it has been difficult to find afghans who do not want the former king back .
many still refer to him as the king or his majesty or baaba - grandfather .
however , there are figures who are less impressed , who fear his popularity could be used as a rallying point .
it was noticeable that the defence minister , general fahim , who is also the military chief of the dominant armed faction in kabul was absent - on a state trip to france .
also missing were the former president , burhanuddin rabbani , and the other old islamist mujahideen leader , abdul rassoul saif .
the man likely to benefit the most from this return is the interim leader , hamid karzai .
he will be remembered as the man who brought the former king home .
like zahir shah , he is an ethnic pashtun , but is seen as a nationalist .
despite the pomp , the former king is back as a private citizen .
however , there are those who would like him to be more .
" why not , why should n't he become king again ? " said taj mohammed wardak , governor of paktia province .
" maybe the loya jirga - the national gathering of afghans which will chose a new government in june - maybe they will ask him to take the throne again . " said another delegate from the south of afghanistan .
tribal welcome on the road from the airport to his new home , ethnic pashtun tribesmen danced the atan - the national dance of celebration - hair flying , in white and red shalwar chemise whirling round . "
this is a moment of happiness for afghanistan - to see his majesty coming back " asif , student it was organised by the pro-king , tribal affairs ministry .
generally , afghans were prevented from getting near the airport road .
except for those who live close by , it was impossible for ordinary people to get near the motorcade .
the organisers may have feared insecurity - or they may not have wanted the former king to seem too popular .
most of compatriots hope the king will bring new life to afghanistan .
" this is a moment of happiness for afghanistan - to see his majesty coming back , " said asif , a student , waiting on the road from kabul , with many others carrying banners and placards .
" our father is coming home , " said another man , " now there will be peace and stability in our country . "
it has been a recurring comment .
somehow , many afghans believe their elderly , former king will bring better times to their country .
exiled zahir shah left afghanistan 29 years ago to get medical treatment in britain for an injury sustained playing volleyball .
he had been ruling afghanistan for four decades , when his cousin , daoud , seized power .
since then , his country has seen revolution , occupation and bloodshed - millions killed or made refugees .
" when he left , god 's blessing left our country , " was how one woman in the crowd put it .
the former king is probably the only afghan who enjoys nation-wide support , from every ethnic group .
it has been difficult in the last few weeks to find anyone who did not want him back .
return unimaginable two years ago , sitting on a quiet news day with a couple of afghan journalist friends in kabul , we were discussing what news stories we 'd most like to cover .
that 's easy said one , the return of the king .
we laughed - it was such an unimaginable event .
then deep in the civil war , neither the taleban nor the northern alliance favoured zahir shah .
i realised only gradually how important the fantasy of the king still is for afghans .
asking people what they think about him , they keep saying he 'll bring peace and stability .
he 's a potent symbol of a kinder , pre-war era .

he looked younger than he has for years as he stepped off the italian military plane at kabul airport , escorted by the afghan interim leader , hamid karzai .
he spent a few minutes greeting ministers and delegations from across the country , shaking hands and smiling , before being ushered away to his new home by aides fearful that he might overextend himself .
now we will be at peace again - for evermore nafisa nazeera zahir shah will find kabul a city ruined and shattered by war .
since he was forced to abdicate by his cousin , daoud , in 1973 , afghanistan has suffered coups , occupation and bloodshed .
no wonder many afghans look back at his 40 year long reign as a golden era .
" this is a day of great happiness , the best day , " said nafisa nazeera , one of the delegates from the women 's affairs ministry .
" now we will be at peace again - for evermore . "
ministers absent it has been difficult to find afghans who do not want the former king back .
zahir shah is a symbol of better times many still refer to him as the king or his majesty or baaba - grandfather .
however , there are figures who are less impressed , who fear his popularity could be used as a rallying point .
it was noticeable that the defence minister , general fahim , who is also the military chief of the dominant armed faction in kabul was absent - on a state trip to france .
also missing were the former president , burhanuddin rabbani , and the other old islamist mujahideen leader , abdul rassoul saif .
the man likely to benefit the most from this return is the interim leader , hamid karzai .
he will be remembered as the man who brought the former king home .
like zahir shah , he is an ethnic pashtun , but is seen as a nationalist .
despite the pomp , the former king is back as a private citizen .
however , there are those who would like him to be more .
" why not , why should n't he become king again ? " said taj mohammed wardak , governor of paktia province .
" maybe the loya jirga - the national gathering of afghans which will chose a new government in june - maybe they will ask him to take the throne again . " said another delegate from the south of afghanistan .
tribal welcome on the road from the airport to his new home , ethnic pashtun tribesmen danced the atan - the national dance of celebration - hair flying , in white and red shalwar chemise whirling round .
this is a moment of happiness for afghanistan - to see his majesty coming back asif , student it was organised by the pro-king , tribal affairs ministry .
generally , afghans were prevented from getting near the airport road .
except for those who live close by , it was impossible for ordinary people to get near the motorcade .
the organisers may have feared insecurity - or they may not have wanted the former king to seem too popular .
most of compatriots hope the king will bring new life to afghanistan .
" this is a moment of happiness for afghanistan - to see his majesty coming back , " said asif , a student , waiting on the road from kabul , with many others carrying banners and placards .
" our father is coming home , " said another man , " now there will be peace and stability in our country . "
it has been a recurring comment .
somehow , many afghans believe their elderly , former king will bring better times to their country .
exiled zahir shah left afghanistan 29 years ago to get medical treatment in britain for an injury sustained playing volleyball .
afghanistan has been devastated by years of war he had been ruling afghanistan for four decades , when his cousin , daoud , seized power .
since then , his country has seen revolution , occupation and bloodshed - millions killed or made refugees .
" when he left , god 's blessing left our country , " was how one woman in the crowd put it .
the former king is probably the only afghan who enjoys nation-wide support , from every ethnic group .
it has been difficult in the last few weeks to find anyone who did not want him back .
return unimaginable two years ago , sitting on a quiet news day with a couple of afghan journalist friends in kabul , we were discussing what news stories we 'd most like to cover .
that 's easy said one , the return of the king .
we laughed - it was such an unimaginable event .
then deep in the civil war , neither the taleban nor the northern alliance favoured zahir shah .
i realised only gradually how important the fantasy of the king still is for afghans .
asking people what they think about him , they keep saying he 'll bring peace and stability .
he 's a potent symbol of a kinder , pre-war era . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's lyse doucet " he only wishes to be close to his people again " daiva vilkelyte , intl .
organisation for migration " we have received over 2,000 applications from people willing to return " organiser of the ex-king 's return abdul khaliq fazal " he is here as a symbol of unity " kabul university 's parwez bezmal " we think that peace and stability will soon come " the loya jirga political healing what is a loya jirga ?

mr bush introduced the idea as a means of making america more self-sufficient in its energy production , but opponents of the plan said it would endanger wildlife in the region .
the senate 's decision is a setback for the president 's highly publicised national energy plan .
line by line , senators were discussing a broader energy bill .
when it came to the section on drilling in alaska , republicans who favoured the plan were unable to force a vote .
that for now kills off the most controversial aspect of the president 's energy strategy .
he had wanted to permit drilling across 2,000 acres of the arctic national wildlife refuge -lrb- anwr -rrb- .
situated on the north-east coast of alaska , the site is home to polar bears , caribou and other arctic creatures .
environmentalists argued that the arrival of oil companies with heavy equipment and machinery would threaten the existence of such animals .
' missed opportunity ' reacting to the senate 's decision , the president 's spokesman said america had missed an opportunity to be more independent in its energy production .
the administration had argued for the plan on the grounds of national security , saying that alaskan oil would make the us less reliant on imports from hostile countries like iraq .
republican senators may yet look for other ways of introducing the plan into a final bill - perhaps by encouraging native american communities in alaska to allow drilling on their land outside the wildlife refuge .
but overturning this defeat will not be easy .

his 229-mile trek to cardiff from the site of owain glyndwr 's parliament at machynlleth aims to raise £ 250,000 toward wales 's first children 's hospital .
he was accompanied by fellow former england captain mike gatting , who has raised £ 10,000 towards the appeal , and cheered off by welsh rugby legend gareth edwards and comedian max boyce .
when the veteran walker reaches cardiff in nine days , he will also be joined by swansea-born actress catherine zeta jones and cardiff singing star charlotte church .
wales is the only european country not to have a hospital dedicated to treating sick children .
the noah 's ark appeal launched in may 2000 with the aim of raising £ 5m to build the first phase of a £ 21m paediatric care unit in the capital .
speaking during the first few miles of the walk , he said : " i just find it staggering that there is n't a children 's hospital in wales .
he added : " it 's one of the most modern european countries and yet it does n't have this facility , so we 'll put that right . "
gareth edwards said : " i think everybody in wales should support this wonderful project .
" the fact that ian botham who has raised so much money in this kind of capacity over the years is putting himself forward to raise this for the children of wales - i think we can only support it . "
cardiff and vale nhs trust has already provided the site and infrastructure and the welsh assembly has pledged an extra £ 4.5m on completion of phase one .
last month , a supermarket chain donated £ 500,000 to the appeal .
the planned 50-bed unit will provide facilities specifically for children and their families .
doctors and parents have campaigned for many years to establish a specialist unit .
the ultimate aim is to build a complete hospital which will replace existing facilities at the university hospital of wales in cardiff , which staff and relatives of patients say are unsatisfactory .
in august 2001 , the cricketing legend and seasoned charity walker agreed to head the walk on behalf of the appeal .
zeta jones and charlotte church have since become patrons of the campaign .
in september , church donated the proceeds from a concert in cardiff to the appeal .
the two will join him for the last two miles of the trek in cardiff on saturday , 27 april .

the indian government is under pressure following continued hindu-muslim clashes in gujarat in which more than 700 people , mostly muslims , have died .
mr fernandes will spend four days in the state and is expected to decide how long the indian army is to remain deployed in the state .
the indian parliament has been deadlocked since monday over the issue with the opposition pushing for a debate and vote on the gujarat situation .

key allies of the federal coalition as well as the opposition have called for the removal of gujarat 's bjp chief minister , narendra modi , for failing to curb the violence .
a meeting to resolve the impasse in parliament failed on friday as the government refused to agree to an opposition demand to a debate on gujarat followed by a vote .

muslim leaders said parents refused to let their children travel to exam centres located in hindu-dominated areas of the state 's largest city ahmedabad and a number of other cities .
police and paramilitary forces were deployed at exam centres across the state to prevent attacks .
but the police and state authorities have been accused by the muslim community and human rights groups for turning a blind eye on earlier violence , forcing the government to deploy the army .
on wednesday , indian army chief , general s padmanabhan , said he favoured the pull-out of troops as the situation " was normal " .

hanson is more focused now the company applied its own brand to its remaining businesses , completing its evolution from a holding company - the investment vehicle for ex-chairman lord hanson - into a relatively straightforward industrial firm .

the actor was speaking at a press conference of his latest film about a boy , where he stars as an irresponsible adult who befriends a young boy .
zellweger was nominated for an oscar bridget jones was a huge worldwide hit , taking more than £ 40m in the uk alone and earned leading lady renée zellweger an oscar nomination .
bridget jones author helen fielding 's follow-up novel , edge of reason , has already been the subject of sequel rumours .
but grant , who starred as the devious daniel cleaver in the movie , said he " would not put money " on a sequel being made .
he said : " the people who are keen to make the sequel are working title -lrb- bridget jones 's producers -rrb- because they see dollar signs flashing in front of them .
" i 'm a little bit equivocal to tell you the whole truth .
i do n't feel particularly keen .
if you fund more productions , you do n't get more good films , you get more bad ones hugh grant " i do n't want to let everyone else down if they want to do it .
having said that i do n't think renée is that keen to be fat again . "
in his new film , about a boy , grant teams up with directing brothers chris and paul weitz , the duo behind the hit comedy american pie .
rachel weisz , toni collette and victoria smurfit co-star in the movie which is based on nick hornby 's best-selling novel .
' not right ' the film is released in the uk on 26 april and in the us on 17 may .
but grant is not happy with the movie 's trailer on tv across the atlantic .
he told bbc radio 4 's back row programme on saturday that the movie 's producers are trying to push a romantic element in the movie , instead of the main storyline about his relationship with the boy .
about a boy opens on 26 april in the uk " they 're trying to make it like notting hill .
i do n't know if they are right .
i think in marketing terms they are trying to sell the film down the river slightly .
" they make it look like every other american movie , instead of allowing it to be a bit different . "
grant said he was shocked by the attitude of some uk screenwriters who make the transition from tv to the big screen .
grant runs simian films with hurley he told the radio programme : " there are some who know what they are doing , but there are others who have an extraordinary kind of arrogance .
they come out of television and they think they can do this .
" it is a craft and needs to be learnt and learnt the hard way . "
the four weddings and a funeral star was also scathing about the handout of national lottery money to uk film production .
" if you fund more productions , you do n't get more good films , you get more bad ones .
" i would have invested all that money into the film industry , the right kind of film school or screen writing academy .
" people who actually learn to write for the big screen and not just television .
it 's not the same thing at all . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- arthur andersen to face trial categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 19 april , 2002 , 07:30 gmt 08:30 uk arthur andersen to face trial beleaguered accountancy firm arthur andersen is to face a potentially fatal day in court after all , following its abrupt abandonment of talks with the us government .
the firm stands accused of obstructing justice by shredding documents relating to failed energy firm enron after federal authorities had announced an investigation .
until thursday , the company had been desperately trying to find a settlement and avoid facing the charges , since they could deal the final death-blow to the battered company 's hopes of survival .
but andersen has now failed to meet a deadline for analysing the proposals on offer , some of which it has rejected , and the department of justice is now working towards a court date of 6 may .
meanwhile , clients and partners are continuing to jump ship , edging the company closer to the point of no return .
us media reports suggest that four out of five partners have signed non-binding letters of intent , saying they intend to move on .
destroying documents andersen 's lawyers have been tantalisingly close to a deal all week .
within the last few days the outline of a possible settlement has emerged .
but in the end the government 's stipulations on an admission of guilt went further than andersen 's lawyers were prepared to go .
the government was prepared to give the company a three-year stay on prosecution .
but in return , andersen would have to co-operate in the investigation of what went wrong at enron and admit in public that it knew employees were destroying documents .
that could effectively remove the company 's licence to operate in the us .
" we are no longer in talks -lrb- with the justice department -rrb- , " said rusty hardin , one of the firm 's attorneys .
added difficulties the company 's position is further complicated by the fact that its houston chief , david duncan , has already pleaded guilty to obstructing justice .
andersen had fired him in january .
and the firm also faces $ 300m in civil cases , now that criminal talks have broken down .
two days of talks involving a court-appointed mediator ended on wednesday with no solution in sight . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's manuela saragosa " in america companies facing criminal charges can do deals with the authorities to avoid trial " the bbc 's stephen evans " enron executives are still being investigated along with a string of banks " the trial guilty verdict spotlight on mr duncan shredding frenzy trial gets musical starting with a bang the disintegration us workforce axed new chief merger plans fail clients flee background q & a : what now ?

the firm stands accused of obstructing justice by shredding documents relating to failed energy firm enron after federal authorities had announced an investigation .
until thursday , the company had been desperately trying to find a settlement and avoid facing the charges , since they could deal the final death-blow to the battered company 's hopes of survival .
but andersen has now failed to meet a deadline for analysing the proposals on offer , some of which it has rejected , and the department of justice is now working towards a court date of 6 may .
meanwhile , clients and partners are continuing to jump ship , edging the company closer to the point of no return .
us media reports suggest that four out of five partners have signed non-binding letters of intent , saying they intend to move on .
destroying documents andersen 's lawyers have been tantalisingly close to a deal all week .
within the last few days the outline of a possible settlement has emerged .
but in the end the government 's stipulations on an admission of guilt went further than andersen 's lawyers were prepared to go .
the government was prepared to give the company a three-year stay on prosecution .
but in return , andersen would have to co-operate in the investigation of what went wrong at enron and admit in public that it knew employees were destroying documents .
that could effectively remove the company 's licence to operate in the us .
" we are no longer in talks -lrb- with the justice department -rrb- , " said rusty hardin , one of the firm 's attorneys .
added difficulties the company 's position is further complicated by the fact that its houston chief , david duncan , has already pleaded guilty to obstructing justice .
andersen had fired him in january .
and the firm also faces $ 300m in civil cases , now that criminal talks have broken down .
two days of talks involving a court-appointed mediator ended on wednesday with no solution in sight .

angus maclennan , chairman of the foreign banks and securities houses association , said the move could see the " destruction of the best industry in the uk " .
if we are going to get a really good health system we have got to pay for it patricia hewitt trade secretary the fears follow business worries about the penny hike in national insurance a tax on jobs as industry leaders continue to pore over the budget details .
trade secretary patricia hewitt rejected the attacks , saying uk companies wanted the extra healthcare investment because sickness was costing them huge amounts each year .
the ' wrong line ' mr maclennan 's warning to the chancellor came in a letter to the financial times .
mr brown and tony blair should realise urgently that " they have drawn rather close to the line where foreign banks will choose a location other than london " , he says .
business will go abroad , predicts mr maclennan , first through assets being moved and then income going abroad .
digby jones warns of a " tax on jobs " those developments will increase the costs of being in london and make locating in the city uneconomic , he argues .
" our competitor countries must be laughing in anticipation , " adds mr maclennan .
digby jones , director-general of the cbi , also criticised the tax changes included in wednesday 's budget .
" business will be dismayed across the united kingdom because this rise in national insurance contributions is a tax on jobs , " mr jones told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
' fair ' employers did not have to make profits to have to pay the extra charges - a difference from the way a national insurance rise affected employees .
but trade secretary ms hewitt insisted the 1p increase in ni was a " fair way to get this enormous increase in the nhs " .
" sickness is costing uk business alone nearly £ 11bn a year so they , and almost everybody else in our country , knows that if we are going to get a really good health system we have got to pay for it , " ms hewitt told today .
arguing that the costs on business were minimal , she stressed the health service itself as britain 's largest employer would only pay an extra £ 200m compared to a total £ 15bn wage bill .
the social insurance system used in france cost employers £ 60 a week , said ms hewitt .
so general taxation was the best way to fund better public services , she added .

in recent months , this distinction seems to have become blurred amid an angry debate over the responsibilities of accountants .
andersen 's role in the spectacular demise of enron and subsequent indictment for destroying " tons " of paperwork has fuelled much of the criticism .
in the new climate of post-enron paranoia , reports of other investigations by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- have also surfaced .
under fire most recently , the us practice of kpmg was reported to be facing civil charges from the sec over alleged accountancy fraud at the photocopying giant xerox .
the sec itself will not confirm any investigations other than enron , but its chairman harvey l. pitt has spoken of the " pressing need " to reform the regulation of us accountants .
the world 's media has also picked over numerous law suits currently faced by accountancy firms for audits that have failed to uncover irregularities .
what does an accountant do ?
accountants provide a range of services , including audit , tax advice , consulting and corporate finance only auditors actually work on checking company accounts auditing usually involves checking company accounts against underlying records , such as receipts auditors are not responsible for keeping the accounts , as is commonly believed the times newspaper reported " another black day for accountants " earlier this week , as details emerged that equitable life was planning to sue its accountants ernst & young .
equitable 's new management alleges that e & y should not have signed off on the company 's books , given the huge liabilities that the insurer faced .
so is the accountancy profession facing its biggest challenge yet , or is the fuss no more than a storm in a teacup ?
too much flak ?
dr david citron , a senior lecturer in accountancy at the city university business school , believes accountants are taking more than their fair share of the blame .
dr citron : accountants always faced law suits for a start , law suits are nothing new for the profession - and go with the territory .
" when stock markets are nervous or companies are doing badly , there are law suits , " says dr citron , who studied many cases in the early 1990s .
he also points out that the ultimate responsibility for a company 's accounts falls to the managing director , not the auditor .
the small print on top of each set of company accounts , the auditor will always state that its work " includes examination , on a test basis , of evidence " .
this means that auditors test a company 's accounting systems by sampling parts of it , rather than checking every single record .
sometimes things might slip through - and it would be impossible to look at every record , according to dan gidwaney , an accountant and director at the financial training company .
auditors are also forced to weigh up the cost - and time - of doing an audit against the risk of something happening , says dr citron .
conflicts of interest inevitably , the issue of cost is controversial .
society has to decide whether it is prepared to pay the audit fees instead ... if not it has to live with the scandals dr david citron city university business school a lot of accountancy profits come from lucrative consultancy work , such as advising on management structure , marketing strategies and tax liabilities .
" in the last 15 years , audit fees have not been the real earners ; consultancy fees have , " says mr gidwaney .
the value of this consultancy work has caused frustration for some auditors .
" the common complaint among junior auditors is that in the course of their work they find all these adjustments to make to the accounts , propose them to the partner , and then the partner does n't make the client change the accounts , " says one former auditor .
" inevitably , accountants have to take a commercial view and will look to protect their greater commercial interests , " adds mr gidwaney .
in the real world ...
this has led to calls for new regulation to split off the consultancy arms from the audit division .
new accountants are learning more about ethics to date , the sec had resisted such a separation , arguing that an " audit-only " firm does not guarantee an " audit failure free future " .
dr citron says that the payment of fees for audit work is the real crux of the argument , rather than conflict of interest .
" auditors are dependent on the management for fees , and consultancy work only exacerbates this , " he says .
" society has to decide whether it is prepared to pay the audit fees instead ... if not it has to live with the scandals . "
study of ethics nevertheless , the increasing complexity of company accounting has been recognised by the professional bodies that help the industry self-regulate itself .
during the last two years , the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales has been totally revising the main accountancy qualification , aca , with an increased focus on ethics .
" we want auditors to be more reflective , to interpret all of the information and to ask chief executives the right questions , " says professor brian chiplin , executive director of education and training at the institute .
although this pre-dates enron , he points out that other audit failures have triggered the improvement in training .
a dog 's life certainly , the recent accounting scandals , surrounding enron and other companies , have marked a sea change for auditors .
mr gidwaney believes that in the future auditors will make greater use of their ultimate weapon - the threat of " qualifying the accounts " .
qualification means that the auditors do not believe the accounts show a " true and fair view " of the company .
currently , less than 1 % of company accounts are qualified .
dr citron adds that accountants will also become more conscious of protecting their reputation .
" it is the only asset they have .
it takes ages to build up a reputation - and they will seen how rapidly and totally it can be destroyed . "
andersen , which once considered itself a cut above its big four rivals , now faces an ignoble demise after being caught shredding the evidence .
perhaps pedigree counts for very little , if the watchdog eats its homework .

in recent months , this distinction seems to have become blurred amid an angry debate over the responsibilities of accountants .
andersen 's role in the spectacular demise of enron and subsequent indictment for destroying " tons " of paperwork has fuelled much of the criticism .
in the new climate of post-enron paranoia , reports of other investigations by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- have also surfaced .
under fire most recently , the us practice of kpmg was reported to be facing civil charges from the sec over alleged accountancy fraud at the photocopying giant xerox .
the sec itself will not confirm any investigations other than enron , but its chairman harvey l. pitt has spoken of the " pressing need " to reform the regulation of us accountants .
the world 's media has also picked over numerous law suits currently faced by accountancy firms for audits that have failed to uncover irregularities .

the torso of the youngster , believed to be from africa , was spotted floating in the thames by a man walking across tower bridge on 21 september last year .
detectives believe the boy , whom they have called adam , may have been a human sacrifice in an african ritual murder .
such cruel wastage of the lives of our children and youth can not be allowed to continue nelson mandela the former south african president said the " gruesome " case had left him with " sadness and a deep sense of tragedy " .
in a press conference from johannesburg on friday , mr mandela said : " it seems likely that the boy might have come from africa ...
i wish to direct my appeal specifically to people in africa .
" if anywhere , even in the remotest village of our continent , there is a family missing a son of that age , who might have disappeared around that time , 21 september 2001 , please contact the police in london , either directly or through your local police . "
occult unit mr mandela praised the " sterling contribution " of south african detectives and pathologists to the case .
he added : " such cruel wastage of the lives of our children and youth can not be allowed to continue . "
mr mandela made the appeal from johannesburg scotland yard 's commander andy baker and detective inspector will o 'reilly had travelled to johannesburg to brief mr mandela .
the two detectives , who flew out on sunday , have also met officers from the south african police occult crimes unit - the only squad in the world to deal with ritual murder and witchcraft - and academics , doctors and spiritualists .
one of the south african policeman dr gerard labuschagne , said as a result of their visit , detectives had a better idea of the concepts involved .
ritual murder speaking to the bbc , dr labuschagne said : " muti murder is a murder which has taken place with the aim of obtaining body parts for use in traditional medicine .
" with ritual murder the aim is to sacrifice the life of an individual , and at this point they -lsb- the detectives -rsb- are leaning more towards the side of a ritual murder .
" this is not the classic example of what we would expect from a muti murder - typically the person would be disembowelled and parts would be removed from the inside of the body .
" most characteristically the genitalia would be removed from the victim . "
the boy is black and is estimated to be about five or six years old .
dna tests his throat appeared to have been cut before his arms , legs and head were severed .
a south african pathologist who carried out a post mortem said he found all the hallmarks of a ritualistic killing .
dna tests suggested he was from the african continent .
a ground-breaking " bone mapping " tests on his body will help to pinpoint the country and region where he lived and grew up .
stranger theory no one fitting the boy 's description has been reported missing in the uk or europe .
police believe the possibility the boy may have been the victim of a paedophile or stranger is now more remote .
detectives investigating the murder are continuing to appeal for witnesses and a £ 50,000 reward has been offered for information .
