french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .
the treaty called for leaders from both countries to engage in regular consultations at the ministerial level and to coordinate policies that affect both countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .
germany has said that too many of its soldiers are helping keep the peace in the afghan capital kabul and across the balkans for the country to consider any further deployments abroad .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .
germany has said that too many of its soldiers are helping keep the peace in the afghan capital kabul and across the balkans for the country to consider any further deployments abroad .
government officials in berlin declined to comment on the report . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the european union more on the 15-nation bloc 's international policies .

french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .
the treaty called for leaders from both countries to engage in regular consultations at the ministerial level and to coordinate policies that affect both countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .

french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .
germany has said that too many of its soldiers are helping keep the peace in the afghan capital kabul and across the balkans for the country to consider any further deployments abroad .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .

french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .

french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .
germany has said that too many of its soldiers are helping keep the peace in the afghan capital kabul and across the balkans for the country to consider any further deployments abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany and france forge stronger bond from arch foes to friendly neighbors savoir vivre on wheels mutually beneficial germany , france to forge tighter ties europe -pipe- 30.07.2002 eu reform debate tops franco-german summit agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of ice to melt in schwerin at a summit this week in schwerin , president jacqués chirac and chancellor gerhard schröder are seeking to end a dispute over agricultural subsidy cuts that threaten to delay eastward expansion of the european union . a dispute over proposed european union common agricultural policy reforms and plans for expanded military cooperation are expected to dominate the twice annual franco-german summit , which commenced tuesday morning in the eastern german city of schwerin .
french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .
the treaty called for leaders from both countries to engage in regular consultations at the ministerial level and to coordinate policies that affect both countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .
germany has said that too many of its soldiers are helping keep the peace in the afghan capital kabul and across the balkans for the country to consider any further deployments abroad .
government officials in berlin declined to comment on the report . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the european union more on the 15-nation bloc 's international policies .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .
germany has said that too many of its soldiers are helping keep the peace in the afghan capital kabul and across the balkans for the country to consider any further deployments abroad .

the gütersloh-based foundation , the largest stakeholder in the world ’ s fifth-largest media company , is the brainchild of company patriarch reinhard mohn , who had reportedly put up a stiff opposition to middelhoff ’ s plans to list the company on the stock exchange in the coming years . steadying the ship on monday , financial papers were reporting the opposition led to the departure of middelhoff , 49 , who had an ambitious plan that , according to reports , clashed with the visions of chairman emeritus reinhard mohn -lrb- photo -rrb- and his supporters in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , founder of the bertelsmann foundation during his speech at the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the foundation in the german town of guetersloh on wednesday , march13 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / michael sohn -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- now mohn ’ s successor at the foundation and confidant thielen is the company ’ s new point man .
thielen , 59 , takes over a sleeping giant in the media industry .
bertelsmann ag , broke their previous profit earnings last year with a mark of 4.16 billion euro -lrb- $ 4.10 -rrb- . the company owns random house , the world ’ s largest publishing house , rtl , europe ’ s largest broadcaster and record label bmg , among other companies and has been largely unaffected by the turbulence affecting fellow giants such as vivendi and aol time warner . it is for that very reason middelhoff , with his ambitious plans , was pushed aside and the decidedly more conservative thielen brought in to steady the ship , according to one expert . “ gunter thilelen stands for continuity , ” said helmut thoma , a media expert who once headed rtl , in an interview with dw-world .
“ he has shown success with his responsiblities in the past .
he enjoys trust from all the company heads . ” a " miserable self-promoter " but successful the quiet , hard-working thielen has made leaps up the career ladder in recent years that have sometimes taken even germany ’ s business reporters by surprise .
manager magazine listed thielen this year as a manager to look out for . ” the most miserable self-promoter on the bertelsmann board has become one of the most important german media managers , ” wrote the magazine in may . after joining bertelsmann as a managing director of one of the company ’ s printing plants in 1980 , he took control of bertelsmann ’ s print and manufacturing division , since re-named arvato , in 1985 .
he expanded the division ’ s portfolio to include editing and layout services , call and service centers and e-commerce . today , arvato ag has annual revenues of more than 3 billion euro and a staff of 29,000 and thielen sits on bertelsmann ’ s board of directors .
he had actually planned to give up the position in august in order to focus full time on running the foundation , which he took over from mohn in october 2001 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right man at the right time middelhoff and his ambitious plans were too much for the board of directors .

french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .
the treaty called for leaders from both countries to engage in regular consultations at the ministerial level and to coordinate policies that affect both countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .

french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .
the treaty called for leaders from both countries to engage in regular consultations at the ministerial level and to coordinate policies that affect both countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .
germany has said that too many of its soldiers are helping keep the peace in the afghan capital kabul and across the balkans for the country to consider any further deployments abroad .

the gütersloh-based foundation , the largest stakeholder in the world ’ s fifth-largest media company , is the brainchild of company patriarch reinhard mohn , who had reportedly put up a stiff opposition to middelhoff ’ s plans to list the company on the stock exchange in the coming years . steadying the ship on monday , financial papers were reporting the opposition led to the departure of middelhoff , 49 , who had an ambitious plan that , according to reports , clashed with the visions of chairman emeritus reinhard mohn -lrb- photo -rrb- and his supporters in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , founder of the bertelsmann foundation during his speech at the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the foundation in the german town of guetersloh on wednesday , march13 , 2002 .

“ he has shown success with his responsiblities in the past .
he enjoys trust from all the company heads . ” a " miserable self-promoter " but successful the quiet , hard-working thielen has made leaps up the career ladder in recent years that have sometimes taken even germany ’ s business reporters by surprise .
manager magazine listed thielen this year as a manager to look out for . ” the most miserable self-promoter on the bertelsmann board has become one of the most important german media managers , ” wrote the magazine in may . after joining bertelsmann as a managing director of one of the company ’ s printing plants in 1980 , he took control of bertelsmann ’ s print and manufacturing division , since re-named arvato , in 1985 .
he expanded the division ’ s portfolio to include editing and layout services , call and service centers and e-commerce . today , arvato ag has annual revenues of more than 3 billion euro and a staff of 29,000 and thielen sits on bertelsmann ’ s board of directors .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .
germany has said that too many of its soldiers are helping keep the peace in the afghan capital kabul and across the balkans for the country to consider any further deployments abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany and france forge stronger bond from arch foes to friendly neighbors savoir vivre on wheels mutually beneficial germany , france to forge tighter ties europe -pipe- 30.07.2002 eu reform debate tops franco-german summit agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of ice to melt in schwerin at a summit this week in schwerin , president jacqués chirac and chancellor gerhard schröder are seeking to end a dispute over agricultural subsidy cuts that threaten to delay eastward expansion of the european union . a dispute over proposed european union common agricultural policy reforms and plans for expanded military cooperation are expected to dominate the twice annual franco-german summit , which commenced tuesday morning in the eastern german city of schwerin .
french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .
the treaty called for leaders from both countries to engage in regular consultations at the ministerial level and to coordinate policies that affect both countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .

french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .

french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .
in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .

the gütersloh-based foundation , the largest stakeholder in the world ’ s fifth-largest media company , is the brainchild of company patriarch reinhard mohn , who had reportedly put up a stiff opposition to middelhoff ’ s plans to list the company on the stock exchange in the coming years . steadying the ship on monday , financial papers were reporting the opposition led to the departure of middelhoff , 49 , who had an ambitious plan that , according to reports , clashed with the visions of chairman emeritus reinhard mohn -lrb- photo -rrb- and his supporters in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , founder of the bertelsmann foundation during his speech at the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the foundation in the german town of guetersloh on wednesday , march13 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / michael sohn -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- now mohn ’ s successor at the foundation and confidant thielen is the company ’ s new point man .
thielen , 59 , takes over a sleeping giant in the media industry .
bertelsmann ag , broke their previous profit earnings last year with a mark of 4.16 billion euro -lrb- $ 4.10 -rrb- . the company owns random house , the world ’ s largest publishing house , rtl , europe ’ s largest broadcaster and record label bmg , among other companies and has been largely unaffected by the turbulence affecting fellow giants such as vivendi and aol time warner . it is for that very reason middelhoff , with his ambitious plans , was pushed aside and the decidedly more conservative thielen brought in to steady the ship , according to one expert . “ gunter thilelen stands for continuity , ” said helmut thoma , a media expert who once headed rtl , in an interview with dw-world .
“ he has shown success with his responsiblities in the past .
he enjoys trust from all the company heads . ” a " miserable self-promoter " but successful the quiet , hard-working thielen has made leaps up the career ladder in recent years that have sometimes taken even germany ’ s business reporters by surprise .
manager magazine listed thielen this year as a manager to look out for . ” the most miserable self-promoter on the bertelsmann board has become one of the most important german media managers , ” wrote the magazine in may . after joining bertelsmann as a managing director of one of the company ’ s printing plants in 1980 , he took control of bertelsmann ’ s print and manufacturing division , since re-named arvato , in 1985 .
he expanded the division ’ s portfolio to include editing and layout services , call and service centers and e-commerce . today , arvato ag has annual revenues of more than 3 billion euro and a staff of 29,000 and thielen sits on bertelsmann ’ s board of directors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany and france forge stronger bond from arch foes to friendly neighbors savoir vivre on wheels mutually beneficial germany , france to forge tighter ties europe -pipe- 30.07.2002 eu reform debate tops franco-german summit agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of ice to melt in schwerin at a summit this week in schwerin , president jacqués chirac and chancellor gerhard schröder are seeking to end a dispute over agricultural subsidy cuts that threaten to delay eastward expansion of the european union . a dispute over proposed european union common agricultural policy reforms and plans for expanded military cooperation are expected to dominate the twice annual franco-german summit , which commenced tuesday morning in the eastern german city of schwerin .
french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .

french president jacqués chirac and prime minister jean pierre raffarin are meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder in an effort to set a time table for reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy -lrb- caps -rrb- reforms approved earlier this month by the european commission in brussels .
the reforms still require ratification by the eu 's 15 member nations before they can be enacted .
schröder supports massive reductions in direct subsidy payments to farmers , but the french government has said it wants to maintain the current system and not begin negotiating what will likely be painful reforms for french farmers until 2006 , the time when the eu agricultural budget agreed to in 1999 is set to expire .
schröder , who is being accompanied at the summit by cabinet ministers including foreign minister joschka fischer , wants to cut a deal with the french , but chirac has vowed that he will fight the plan .
the eastward expansion of the eu , planned for 2004 , could be delayed if the two countries fail to reach an agreement by november .
cold wind blowing between france and germany the debate over the commission 's agricultural reforms has recently led to frostier-than-normal relations between germany and france .
eu agricultural subsidies are a sensitive issue for germans , who pump 9.97 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- a year into brussels ' agricultural policy coffers but only get back 5.64 billion euro .
the french , by contrast , are a major beneficiary of the program , paying in 6.6 billion but receiving 8.98 billion euro back .
an agreement is said to be essential for the eu 's eastward expansion plans .
however , with germany in the middle of a heated parliamentary election campaign , gerhard schröder will have little maneuvering room prior to september 22 , which would leave just weeks until the november deadline for an eu-wide deal on the conditions for expansion that was agreed upon at a eu summit in seville , spain in june this year .

in an interview with the german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on tuesday , daniel cohn-bendit , a french green and member of the european parliament , said that relations between germany and france had become " paralyzed " by the dispute . the source of the problem , he said , was " differing assessments " of europe 's responsibilities with regard to expansion the countries have developed .
still , he said it is important for france and germany to work together to protect their citizens from u.s. hegemony .
the two countries , he said , should replace the 1963 treaty with a new vision that provides an alternative model to a world that is unilaterally controlled by the united states expanded military cooperation the two countries are also expected to announce a deal on tuesday at the schwerin summit merging the countries ' military satellite intelligence systems .
a feasibility study to find the best way to accomplish the task will be conducted at a cost of 800,000 euro .
discussion on the international war against terrorism and recent political developments in the middle east and afghanistan are also on the agenda of the last franco-german summit to be held prior to german federal elections .
the first franco-german summit commenced after the signing of the elysée treaty in 1963 by then-german chancellor konrad adenauer and french president charles de gaulle .

he met with iranian president mohammad khatami on monday .
the european union would like to strengthen its ties with iran .
but foreign policy chief javier solana says it expects progress on both economic and political aspects from the islamic republic . iran 's stance on the middle east and its alleged arms stockpile are " a serious obstacle " to closer relations with the european union , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the diplomat arrived in tehran on monday as part of a regional tour , before he heads to the association of south east asian nations forum in brunei later this week .
however , solana added that the eu was still intent on further strengthening its ties to iran .
this required both economic and political progress .
" they go hand in hand , " he told a joint news conference with iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi in tehran .
iran has denied seeking weapons of mass destruction and says its arms development is for defensive purposes .
it also denies supplying weapons to palestinian militant groups , such as hamas and islamic jihad , who have launched suicide attacks in israel .
more than just commercial interests the eu and iran have seen an improvement in relations in recent years .
earlier this month , brussels decided to open negotiations with iran on a trade and cooperation agreement .
but , said solana , the eu did not believe that such an agreement can cover only economic aspects .
it also had to include political issues , such as human rights , cooperation on fighting terrorism and continued iranian support for the new government in afghanistan .
" we see all these parts as an inseparable whole , " he said .
" our relation is a two-way relation .
it will not progress unless there is a clear reciprocity .
we also believe that eu-iran relations can never reach their full potential if we do not eliminate problems that hamper such a positive development . "
the u.s. has voiced concern about similar issues , but it has taken a different path from the eu and placed iran in its so-called " axis of evil " .
at the news conference , foreign minister kharrazi criticized what he termed washington 's " bullying , go-it-alone " approach .
he praised the eu 's " independent " stance .
a further concern by iranian leaders is the threat of u.s. military action in neighboring iraq .
according to government officials in tehran , this will also be a topic of discussion during solana 's visit .
iran against u.s. assault on iraq iran has repeatedly denounced plans by washington to forcefully depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
but european nations do n't appear to be giving backing on this issue .
britain and turkey have openly pledged support for a u.s. assault .
germany , however , is still maintaining a low-key stance .
but according to the german news magazine der spiegel , washington expects a clear answer by the end of september , when nato defense ministers are to meet in the polish capital of warsaw .
the magazine said u.s. and british troops would lead the assault against iraqi leader saddam hussein , while germany would be expected to provide mainly logistical and financial assistance .

" sacrifices will be needed , probably beyond those with which society has already come to terms , " the panel concluded .
the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- appointed the group of four top international bankers to act as middlemen in its talks with the south american country .
argentina has been negotiating with the imf for months , desperate to secure new loans to help it on its course to recovery .
since last december , argentina 's financial difficulties have included a currency devaluation , a default on international debt , soaring unemployment and a freeze on savings withdrawals from banks .
that in turn has led to deep social unrest , with almost daily protests on the streets of buenos aires and the ousting of previous governments .
no pain , no gain the current argentine government is desperate to re-establish order and help its people cope with rising poverty .
but it is also forced into painful measures to put its financial house in order and win the favour of the imf .
a freeze on the withdrawal of savings from bank accounts is particularly unpopular .
but its removal risks a run on the banks which are already on the point of collapse .
finance minister roberto lavagna welcomed the panel 's report , saying it endorsed the general direction of his economic policy .
the imf 's chief , horst koehler , also welcomed the group 's conclusions , and underlined the importance of the adoption of a " credible monetary anchor " to prevent hyperinflation .
central bank experience analysts say the imf is being especially tough on argentina following its default , as many reforms promised in the past have failed to materialise .
argentina is hoping to unlock $ 9.5bn -lrb- £ 6bn -rrb- of imf funds which have been frozen since december .
mr koehler has said the imf is prepared to establish a new loan programme for the country as soon as the authorities are in a position to ensure the implementation of sound monetary policies .
the delegation was led by andrew crockett , managing director of the swiss-based bank for international settlements , which sets standards for central bankers .
the other three members are all former heads of central banks in germany , spain and canada .

they also found they : had low levels of an antibody which fights infection , and low rates of saliva flow , which is another way we protect ourselves from viruses .
click here to watch the david sparkes interview on breakfast we spoke to david sparkes from the amateur swimming association .
he said : " any exercise is better than none . "
the research is very interesting , we should n't however leap to conclusions , it is a very small group that has been looked at .
and we need much more work before we can accept this type of research .
our opinion is you do your exercise when you feel comfortable .
professional swimmers train in the morning as they have a big volume to get through .
and any exercise is better than none .
read on to find out where , how , what equipment and the benefits you can gain from swimming .
swimming as a sport can be extremely informal or can involve serious training and competition in galas .
most swimming clubs cater for all age groups , and often seniors and masters swimmers will become involved in coaching or running of the club .
did you know ?
a ten and a half stone person swimming front crawl uses about 11 calories per minute - so 30 minutes ' swimming will use up 330 calories .
how seriously you take your training is your own choice .
highly competitive swimmers train 5-6 days a week , and may also carry out land-based sport-specific training .
other people may simply swim with a club once or twice a week and may never enter a competition .
how do you do it ?
most swimming pools have mother and toddler sessions , ladies-only sessions , lane-swimming sessions , and over-50s ' swimming sessions .
most also have lessons for adult beginners and improvers as well as for children .
setting a goal to swim once a week will get you started - and swimming at the same time on the same day each week increases the likelihood of meeting the same people , so adding a social element .
if swimming a length is too far to start with , swim widths , gradually building up the number of widths until you can swim the distance for a length .
once you can swim a length you can gradually build up the number of lengths you swim at each session , and then start to swim continuously for a set time .
where can you do it ?
record-breaking calorie burning : gertrude caroline ederle was the first woman to swim across the english channel .
on the 6th of august , 1926 , she also set a new time record .
she swam from cape gris-nez , france , to dover - a distance of 56 km -lrb- 35 miles -rrb- , in 14 hr 31 min .
to swim the equivalent of this in a 25 metre swimming pool would be 2,240 lengths and would burn 9,581 calories !
lane-swimming sessions allow for those people who want to swim as a form of exercise rather than just playing in the pool .
the pool is divided into lanes designated for fast , medium and slow swimmers so that people can choose to swim with others of similar standard .
swimming widths and jumping in and out is not allowed during these sessions .
swimming with other people increases motivation , and an advantage of swimming with a club is that the exercise / training session is defined by the coach - and it 's likely that you will work harder and complete each full training session .
coaching sessions will also have drills to improve your stroke technique .
benefits swimming improves the condition of the heart and lungs and works both upper and lower body muscles .
to swim well a high degree of flexibility is needed , thus regular swimming will help to maintain flexibility - especially in the shoulder area .
equipment a well-fitting pair of swimming goggles prevents the chlorine in the pool from damaging your eyes .
a swimming cap will keep your hair out of the way and reduce the amount of water streaming across your face when you lift your head to breathe .
some people also find a noseclip useful .
a pull buoy gives your legs extra buoyancy so that you can concentrate on arm technique .
hand paddles increase the workload on the upper body so adding in a specific type of strength training .
here are a few ideas that you may want to consider to help make exercising more enjoyable : exercise with a friend at a pace that means you can still talk to each other .
be active to music .
choose to exercise in a beautiful place like a beach , a park or on a river bank .
exercise whilst wearing clothes that make you feel good and in which you feel comfortable .
vary your activity , so that you do n't get bored .
for example , if you normally exercise indoors , try an outdoor activity and vice-versa .
try something that helps you ' find the child in you ' again , like flying a kite or using a microscooter .
experts say from a health perspective , the important thing is that you are moving , that your heart is pumping blood at a slightly increased rate , and that you 're using up calories to power your muscles .
so choose activities that are fun and that you want to do , not those that you think you must do , as there is more chance that you will find time for them .
physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease .
in other words , if you do n't exercise , you dramatically increase your risk of dying from a heart attack .
being physically active has been shown to be positively associated with good mental health .
it can help in the management of conditions like depression and anxiety .
obesity is on the increase in the uk , and part of the solution is physical activity .
if you do n't do enough exercise and you eat too much , you 're going to get fat which can be dangerous to your health .
exercise has also been shown to have a positive effect on a range of medical conditions including hypertension , diabetes and lower back pain .
doctors say to achieve these health benefits , it 's recommended that people take 30 minutes of moderate physical activity -lrb- for example brisk walking -rrb- on 5 days of the week .
that 's 1.5 % of the total time in a seven-day week - and for a priority like improving your health , it represents an excellent investment of time and effort .
