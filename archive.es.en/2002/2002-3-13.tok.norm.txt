however , not all is forgotton in post-wall berlin . the east german regime obviously expected trouble forty years ago , when it decided to build a wall to divide berlin .
the stasi , east germany 's infamous secret police , devoted nearly all their resources and 50 000 staff to the job for a whole year .
and timed the operation to begin shortly after midnight , on a sunday .
more than 75 000 people were imprisoned for trying to escape .
on average , one every three and a half hours every day for 28 years .
these figures are the result of the latest research , drawn up by two historians who work at the bstu , the institute which holds the files of east germany 's secret police , published recently .
more than 800 people were killed trying to escape - an approximate figure , even now .
they died trying to escape over the wall , at the borders , or drowned in the baltic sea .
on the brink of war these people attempted to escape from east germany because they were suddenly locked in .
until the late 1950 's , underground trains still connected the soviet sector with the other allied zones .
the loophole had to be plugged , according to the intellectual architect of the wall , walther ulbricht , chairman of the sed , the socialist dictatorship that ruled east germany .
in order to avoid the soviet sector being drained , those inside the sector had to be prevented from leaving .
2.7 million had already done so by august 13 , 1961 .
at 3.25 on the morning of the 13th , rias , " radio in the american sector " , reported that the entire border around west berlin had been closed .
the operation had taken little more than three hours .
overnight , the population of an entire city had been taken by surprise .
once again , the world stood on the brink of war and nuclear capabilities overshadowed the possibility of a limited theatre .
the soviets had successfully completed testing an intercontinental ballistic missile .
and in october 1961 , us tanks stood face-to-face with soviet tanks at checkpoint charlie in berlin .
politically it was perhaps one of the most volatile moments in modern history .
thanks to the efforts of a middle man , however , who mediated in the crisis , the tanks withdrew .
it was to take 28 years until the wall was torn down again .
so many unanswered questions how the decision was taken to close the borders to the west and who knew about it , remains nebulous at best .
many questions still remain unanswered : did khrushchev order the closure or did he make a secret deal with kennedy ?
how long in advance did western intelligence services know about this , and why did the allied powers do nothing to stop it ?
why did n't they warn the people in the soviet sector that it was about to happen ?
so far , miles and miles of secret police files have still not provided the answers , twelve years after the wall came down and forty years after the wall was built . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : checkpoint charlie : symbol of division radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the killings happened in an attack apparently linked to the major operation against al-qaeda and taleban strongholds in the east of the country . "
the shikin area is a suspected sanctuary for the al-qaeda and taleban and the personnel in this vehicle were believed to be linked to al-qaeda activities " us statement this brief statement is the first admission by the us military that some women and children have been killed in the major us offensive , operation anaconda , which is continuing in eastern afghanistan .
the military 's central command , which controls the afghan operation , said two american fighter jets attacked a vehicle in the area on the morning of 6 march .
' taleban sanctuary ' the central command statement said the incident happened near shikin , in paktia province , near the pakistan border .
" the shikin area is a suspected sanctuary for the al-qaeda and taleban and the personnel in this vehicle were believed to be linked to al-qaeda activities , " the statement said .
fourteen people were killed , most them adult men , but some women and children .
according to the military , a child was also wounded and is now recovering in hospital .
a central command spokesman , air force lieutenant colonel martin compton , said he did not know if all 15 were civilians and whether they were afghans .
late disclosure reports from the area have suggested that many al-qaeda and taleban fighters who have gathered there have taken their families with them but this is the first mention by the united states of possible civilian casualties .
the us department of defense has consistently refused to disclose specific numbers of casualties among the al-qaeda and taleban in operation anaconda .
earlier on tuesday , pentagon spokeswoman victoria clarke said she had no information indicating that women or children might have died in the operation .
asked why the incident was not publicised earlier , colonel compton said american military officials needed time to piece together the information before disclosing the incident .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- texas mother guilty of drowning children categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : americas front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 13 march , 2002 , 05:31 gmt texas mother guilty of drowning children yates ' defence claimed she suffered from mental illness texas housewife andrea yates has been found guilty of drowning her children .
jurors deliberated for less than four hours before giving their verdict .
andrea yates knew right from wrong , and she made a choice ... to kill her children deliberately and with deception kaylynn williford prosecution lawyer they will now decide whether yates will face the death penalty or be jailed for life .
the former nurse confessed to murdering her five children , aged between six months to seven years , in the bathtub of her home in houston .
yates showed little emotion as the sentence was read out .
but her husband russell yates , who had supported her throughout the trial , muttered " oh , god " and held his head in his hands .
mental illness claim the court heard that yates held the children under water until they ceased to struggle .
" oh god ! " : russell yates had spoken of his wife 's history of depression her defence claimed she suffered from severe mental illness which led her to not know the difference between right from wrong .
" she was so psychotic on 20 june -lrb- last year -rrb- that she absolutely believed what she was doing was the right thing to do , " said defence lawyer george parnham .
yates had been hospitalised several times for severe depression and had attempted suicide on at least one occasion .
husband 's support however prosecutors successfully argued that yates , despite being ill , had been aware of the difference between right and wrong and knew she was committing an illegal act .
yates 's mother , jutta karin kennedy , was in court for the verdict " andrea yates knew right from wrong , and she made a choice on 20 june -lrb- last year -rrb- to kill her children deliberately and with deception , " said prosecution lawyer kaylynn williford .
the jury will hear statements in the sentencing phrase of the trial on thursday .
under texas law , the only two options are life in prison , without the possibility of parole for 40 years , or death by lethal injection .
harris county , where the trial is being held , passes more death sentences than any other county in the united states , with texas the state carrying out most executions .
history of depression the case strongly divided american opinion , with many unnerved by the prospect of sending a woman to the execution chamber but outraged by the horrific nature of the crime .
yates drowned her children in a bathtub in the family 's home others , particularly women 's rights groups , argued that yates had been denied treatment she desperately needed and should now be helped , not punished .
russell yates said his wife had twice attempted suicide and had been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for treatment .
yates ' medical records gave full details of her frequent bouts of depression and suicidal behaviour .
and a doctor also reportedly cautioned yates and her husband not to have further children following the birth of their fourth child .
the children were found dead in the family home in june last year after yates called the police and confessed to the crime .
four of the children were discovered under sheets on a bed while a fifth was found in a bathtub .
all had been drowned .

twenty-four volunteers were recruited to play the part of soldiers for two weeks in front of the cameras .
many of those who played the volunteers found it emotional they had 10 days of training before they were sent back in time .
they wore the same uniforms , and replicated the same routine that a ww1 soldier had to go through .
this meant spending time in the trenches and in " billets " .
billets were buildings that were taken over by the army during war .
these could be cow sheds , or family homes .
we ' talked to one of the volunteers .
john robinson knew very little about trench life when he signed up to take part in the series .
boredom was experienced : a reality of trench life he said the lack of sleep was probably the worst bit .
he also found it staggering that real volunteers had to endure the same hardship for more than four years . -lrb- watch our interviews by clicking the video icon on the top right of this page . -rrb-
a war without parallel world war i was a war without parallel - all previous wars were eclipsed by its scale of destruction .
it was a struggle between europe 's great powers , which were grouped into two hostile alliances .
trench warfare remains the lasting image of ww1 the number of men mobilised totalled over 65 million .
when the fighting was finally over , no-one could tell exactly how many had been killed but historians estimate that up to 10 million men lost their lives on the battlefield - and another 20 million were wounded .
world war i is also regarded as the first " total war " in which the combatants mobilised all their resources , military , industrial and human , on a scale never before thought possible . watch / listen on this story a ' volunteer ' and the series producer the trench home when we are on air recent forums programme archive studio tour today 's information meet the team presenters reporters your say contact us your comments see also : 07 mar 02 -pipe- uk ' i survived the trenches - and would never go back ' 10 nov 98 -pipe- world war i the war to end all wars internet links : trenches on the web the great war society imperial war museum the trench series : background and history the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites e-mail this story to a friend links to more breakfast stories in this section running the red soak the rich metrosexual man casualty 's big day rail passengers face above inflation rise the truth about nanotechnology hoover street revival hitchcock blonde when violence begins at home more children suffering from eating disorders calling time on licensing laws the lessons of the trupti patel case open all hours ^ ^ back to top news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes - to bbc sport > > -pipe- to bbc weather > > -pipe- to bbc world service > > - © mmiii -pipe- news sources -pipe- privacy

strapped down to his death bed , with intravenous tubes plugged into both arms , feeding a cocktail of lethal chemicals into his bloodstream , it took some minutes for him to die .
the first injection , of the sedative sodium pentothal , was administered to housel in the execution chamber at georgia diagnostic and classification prison at 1917 -lrb- 0017 gmt -rrb- .
there were no signs of panic gary proctor friend and witness there followed a dose of pavulon , a drug designed to paralyse the lungs , and finally potassium chloride , which stops the heart .
housel , who had been sentenced to death in 1986 for the murder of jeanne drew , was eventually declared dead at 1928 -lrb- 0028 gmt -rrb- .
he had fought his case almost to the last .
having failed to disentangle himself from the clutches of death row by asserting his british nationality , housel went to the courts claiming a violation of human rights .
but when the united states supreme court turned down his appeal at about 1730 , all his options had run out .
old stories it had already been a deeply harrowing day for housel 's friends and family - his mother , lula mae pellerin , and 20-year-old son , randall housel , were with him until mid-afternoon .
" there were no signs of panic , " said his friend gary proctor .
" tracy did most of the talking .

the money is being granted for work on belle vue park in newport , under the fund 's urban parks programme .
the buildings have suffered over the years it is the only public park to have been designed by the landscape architect thomas mawson .
newport council says a five-year restoration programme will begin in the summer , as part of plans to regenerate the stow hill area of the town .
the grade ii listed park was laid out on land given to the local council by lord tredegar in 1892 .
its creator , thomas mawson , was the most prolific british garden designer of his day , responsible for the private gardens at dyffryn house in the vale of glamorgan .
the council wants to boost visitor numbers despite suffering from vandalism and decay , belle vue still attracts more than 100,000 visitors a year , including 20 school trips .
many of the park 's features and structures have been individually listed , but some have fallen into disrepair over the years .
the council has drawn up a five-year restoration plan to return the park to an appearance more in keeping with mawson 's original ideas .
several important features will be conserved , restored and reinstated .
facilities like toilets are out of bounds a key goal is to recreate , as closely as possible , the original edwardian planting scheme , including a lime avenue .
other more recent and inappropriate additions will be replaced .
a park manager will be appointed to foster links with local community groups and schools .
the council also plans to provide information for visitors within the park 's historic pavilion building .
kim biddlecombe , senior grants officer with the heritage lottery fund , praised the council 's proposal .
many important features survive " belle vue is a truly extraordinary public open space with historic and beautiful features and planting .
" the council 's proposals to restore the park will preserve the history of this unique green space and secure its future for generations to come . "
in august 2001 , a report revealed that britain 's historic parks needed £ 3.5bn of investment to restore them to their former glory .
the policy studies institute claimed there had been a dramatic decline , with fewer than one in five parks in good condition .
the survey found that more than half of all the bandstands , fountains and paddling pools , had been lost to public use , as well as a quarter of amenities such as toilets and shelters .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- cook islands set to back pig transplants categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : asia-pacific front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 13 march , 2002 , 07:46 gmt cook islands set to back pig transplants pig viruses carry unknown risks to people richard black bbc science correspondent the government of the cook islands has said it will probably approve a proposal by a new zealand biotechnology company to run trials of an experimental diabetes treatment which is banned in many western countries .
the treatment involves transplanting cells from pigs into humans .
the cells should start making insulin , curing the diabetes .
pig cell transplant research is banned in much of the west because scientists believe there is a risk of pig viruses entering the human population .
meanwhile the new zealand health ministry has released documents detailing why it turned down an application by the company , diatranz , to run a similar trial in new zealand .
the cook islands ' government of the cook islands says it expects to approve the proposed trial within a couple of weeks .
' inadequate safeguards ' several western experts have criticised the plan , saying ethical supervision of such a trial would be inadequate in a developing country , and the facilities needed to monitor patients for infection do not exist .
reports from the cook islands say the government has been offered a share in diatranz 's profits if the treatment is shown to work and then marketed globally .

the treatment involves transplanting cells from pigs into humans .
the cells should start making insulin , curing the diabetes .
pig cell transplant research is banned in much of the west because scientists believe there is a risk of pig viruses entering the human population .
meanwhile the new zealand health ministry has released documents detailing why it turned down an application by the company , diatranz , to run a similar trial in new zealand .
the cook islands ' government of the cook islands says it expects to approve the proposed trial within a couple of weeks .
' inadequate safeguards ' several western experts have criticised the plan , saying ethical supervision of such a trial would be inadequate in a developing country , and the facilities needed to monitor patients for infection do not exist .
reports from the cook islands say the government has been offered a share in diatranz 's profits if the treatment is shown to work and then marketed globally .
last year diatranz applied to run a similar trial of its experimental treatment in new zealand , but was turned down by a government advisory committee .
details of the committee 's reasoning have now been released - it says diatranz could not prove the treatment actually worked in the animals they had tested it on , and its proposals for consulting people taking part in the trial fell short of international standards .

people with type 2 diabetes who develop complications are likely to lose an average of £ 14,000 a year , but it could be as much as £ 24,000 annually .
research shows they also often have the added burden of bills for private health care , medications and testing equipment .
the findings coincide with the publication of a report suggesting about 80 % of people with diabetes are likely to die of cardiovascular disease .
approximately 80 % of adults with diabetes are likely to die of cardiovascular disease professor marja-riitta taskinen , helsinki the diabetic complications , identified in two studies of 2,300 people , ranged from foot ulcers and blindness to heart disease and stroke .
diabetics who develop complications are regularly absent from work because they often spend long periods in hospital .
the studies reveal that hospital stays for diabetics with complications were two to three times longer than those of people without complications .
type 2 diabetes affects about 10 % of adults over the age of 60 .
people with the condition are unable to control levels of sugar in their blood .
this is partly due to defects in a particular type of specialised cell found in the pancreas .
these b-cells produce the hormone insulin that regulates the way sugar is broken down in the body .
one of the study authors , professor rhys williams from the nuffield institute for health , said : " it is essential to address the condition early with effective treatment plans , in order to prevent the progression of the disease and the onset of devastating complications , such as heart disease and stroke . "
diabetes forecast coronary heart disease is the main cause of illness and death among people with type 2 diabetes and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease -lrb- cvd -rrb- is significantly higher in people with diabetes compared to those without the disease .
however , a report published in practical diabetes international suggests millions of people worldwide with type 2 diabetes are suffering and dying unnecessarily every year due to the inadequate screening and treatment procedures for cvd risk factors .
the international diabetes federation estimates that 300 million people will have diabetes by 2005 - doubling current estimates .
professor marja-riitta taskinen at the university of helsinki , finland , said : " approximately one in two people with diabetes remains undiagnosed .
" statistics have demonstrated that approximately 80 % of adults with diabetes are likely to die of cardiovascular disease .
" so the importance of educating patients and health care professionals about diabetes care and the consequences of inadequate screening and treatment can not be over-emphasised . "
the report stresses the need for better screening , suggesting that not enough people with diabetes undergo lipid profile assessments - which measure blood cholesterol levels .
they say these tests are essential to ensure patients receive the correct treatment .

the quality of each of the launch titles , including dead or alive 3 and oddworld , is very high .
the console is still awaiting a genre-breaking title to show off the machine 's capabilities and the next 12 months should be very interesting .
