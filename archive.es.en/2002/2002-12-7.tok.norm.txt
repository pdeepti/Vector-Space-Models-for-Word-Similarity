white wine and haddock - that does n't bode well for the national wealth .

the worrying news is that the pubs are suffering too .
earlier this week , the company behind all bar one , o 'neills and edwards said sales in its pubs have slipped over the last two months .
last month , jd wetherspoon said its profits would be 10 per cent lower than expected this year .
sales are also down at the london-based pub chain fuller , smith & turner - because so many traders and stockbrokers have lost their jobs .
and the company behind the slug and lettuce and parisa chains has owned up to falling profits and mistakes in its accounts .
under the bolly and bitter test , this is grim news indeed .
it suggests we 're cutting back so far , some of us have stopped going out altogether .
lord of the files so let me introduce you my new test - the filing cabinet check .
i popped into an office furniture shop after friday morning 's programme -lrb- this is n't some secret obsession - i 've just decided to tame the wild and unruly paperwork in my back bedroom -rrb- .
after several minutes of gentle abuse about the quality of my shares reporting , the man behind the counter got talking about his business .
and it 's not looking good .
the drop in second hand sales ... suggests there are fewer people setting up their own small businesses .
he 's been through four economic slowdowns during his 30 years in the trade - and he says this is the worst yet .
there 's been a sharp fall in his sales of new office furniture - down 90 per cent in some months .
and there 's also been a drop in demand for second-hand office furniture .
this tells us two things .
the fall-off in sales of new chairs , desks and filing cabinets suggests some of those new offices that are being built in the city right now are not being fitted out .
in other words , they 're lying empty .
that hurts more than our desk-seller .
it means our banks and financial firms still are n't expanding their businesses .
and it could spell trouble for the property companies that built the offices - if they do n't get paying customers in there soon , they could face falling rents and a cash crunch , just as they did at the end of the 1980s .
small businesses the drop in second hand sales tells a different story .
it suggests there are fewer people setting up their own small businesses .
entrepreneurs are the big users of used equipment , because they have to keep their costs low when they 're starting up their companies .
in the mid-1990s , the second hand furniture was being sold on as quickly as it arrived in the showroom .
now we 're in a slowdown , i was the only customer there , and i was spoiled for choice .
this may sound like fanciful rubbish , but the official statistics about the economy back it up .
the fragile recovery we saw in our manufacturing industry at the start of this year seems to be going into reverse .
profits are sliding at the big banks .
insurance companies are being battered by the falling stock markets .
confidence among other service companies is falling .
and even the mighty high street - the engine that 's been keeping the economy going - is starting to suffer , with sales slipping at some of our biggest shops .
if changes to house prices frighten consumers into cutting back .. we 'll have a whole new dose of misery to cope with we should n't get overly alarmed by this just yet .
even though it 's not growing as quickly as the chancellor would like , our economy is still a long way from recession .
next year , we 're likely to have one of the strongest economies in the world - though the sluggishness in america , japan and europe that makes us look good now will be bad for us in the long run .
housing market the big uncertainty in all this is the housing market .
on friday , the halifax said house prices were still rising by 29 per cent a year .
a few days before , the nationwide said prices were going up by a quarter .
all the experts we talk to on breakfast say that ca n't go on .
what they ca n't agree on is how quickly the housing market will cool down .
our houses are still expected to rise in value each year - but by smaller amounts than at present .
most of the experts hope that easing off will be gentle but some warn it might be more sudden than we think .
and that 's where the danger lies .
companies are already cutting back their spending and investment .
if changes to house prices frighten consumers into cutting back too , we 'll have a whole new dose of misery to cope with .

the united nations says it has enough food to last until early next year , but the needs for the rest of 2003 are still to be met .
across ethiopia , just over 11 million people are facing starvation .
mr meles told the bbc that he had already secured world bank guarantees of up to $ 100m in aid - but that would only be used as a last resort if donors failed to respond to the appeal .
the executive director of the un children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- , carol bellamy , has said the world needs to act now to deal with the food crisis triggered by drought .
after visiting one of the worst affected areas she warned of the dangers of donor fatigue , saying the international community must not wait for deaths from starvation .
need bbc east africa correspondent andrew harding says that in arid north-eastern ethiopia many communities have already lost most of their cattle and the animals ' skeletons lie in the dust .
thousands of people are on the move , walking huge distances in search of aid .
as many as 11 million ethiopians need help next year " i hope the donor community this time will respond without delay to avert the crisis from taking place , " ms bellamy said .
she added that ethiopia itself needed to look at improving irrigation , developing drought-resistant crops and digging more wells .
the total aid package that the ethiopian government and un are requesting is worth about $ 575m .
the country 's harvest is almost in and the scale of the current crisis is apparent .
the amount of food aid requested by the ethiopian government is approximately what the international community has been expecting .
but the government has already blamed donor fatigue for the looming crisis and says that unless donors respond swiftly many people will die .
last month , the ethiopian government warned that the country faced a famine worse than that of 1984 which killed nearly one million people and sparked a major international relief effort . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jim fish " eleven million ethiopians are threatened by famine " ibrahim jabr , unicef " this time we are a little better prepared " meles zenawi , ethiopian prime minister " the numbers involved are staggering " full coverage key stories why africa starves globalisation question africa 's gm dilemma horn of africa ethiopia 's long wait gateway for aid q & a : ethiopia 's hunger millions at risk in eritrea southern africa zimbabwe 's victims zambia 's gm food ' fury ' aid worker 's diary hunger stalks angola west africa mauritania : bad harvest senegal in denial ways to help agencies ' appeals clickable map africa 's famine trail : country by country in depth world 's food problem talking point ethiopian famine : how should the world react ?

design and construction delays of the royal navy 's new purpose-built refit centre at devonport in plymouth has meant costs ballooning from Â£ 650m to Â£ 933m .
the ministry of defence will pay Â£ 849m , leaving taxpayers with a bill of at least an extra Â£ 199m , a national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- report said .

it was absolutely essential for our nuclear deterrent programme lord bach under the original contract between the mod and private contractor devonport management limited -lrb- dml -rrb- , the risks of any cost overruns were transferred to dml .

he said : " it was essential for our nuclear deterrent programme that there was a facility ready for hms vanguard to be refitted by february .
he added : " our judgement has been vindicated by the report that the only course we could take was to renegotiate the contract . "
dml now faces a liability bill of Â£ 43m - up from Â£ 35m due to the extra costs .
all trident subs are due for a refit peter whitehouse of dml said the costs were nothing to be ashamed of when compared with other major uk projects .
he said : " if we look at the costs on the channel tunnel , extension to the london underground , they show very significant increases . "
the government has blamed poor management by dml .
but dml 's view is that the mod was largely to blame because it insisted on ever higher safety standards .

one large element of the refit area is a " primary circuit decontamination building " .
it is meant to decontaminate a submarine 's primary circuit , but it is not finished yet .

dml has said the temporary solution has been approved by the regulators .
lord bach has also emphasises no corners were being cut on safety .
he said : " vanguard is being refitted under very careful safety procedures . "
other safety features include the making the submarine dock earthquake proof .

the existing bridge at pont twrch is being replaced because it is narrow , has a poor accident record , and is weak . "
we have included bat roosts and an otter pass within the new bridge " pam palmer , carmarthenshire county council work has already started on the new crossing on the a482 near pumsaint , which is due to open for traffic early in 2003 .
during the planning stages , the council liaised with the environment agency to ensure the habitats of local species would be affected as little as possible .
carmarthenshire council 's pam palmer said environmental concerns were central to the plans .
" measures have been taken to protect bats and nesting birds , " she said .
" we have included bat roosts and an otter pass within the new bridge . "
trevor sage , head of transport at carmarthenshire council , added the bridge would be a single span arch , to help water flow , particularly after floods .
" we are also making modifications to a weir to help the passage of fish , " he said .
serious accidents mr sage said parapets on the old bridge had been damaged by crashes at the site .
" there have been a number of serious accidents due to poor road alignment , and cars have gone into the river , " he said .

" the alternative route , via carmarthen , is about 66 miles long , and could have had serious consequences to the local economy . "
due to an environment agency embargo , work will not be allowed on the river itself during the winter months as it could disturb fish migration patterns .
until this ban is lifted in march , work will be concentrated on the approach roads .
once the bridge is completed , traffic will be diverted away from the old crossing , which will then be demolished .
the project , which will be reinforced using stainless steel , is due to be completed in june 2003 .

they decided that more than 30 years of conflict should be brought to an end .
they pledged to work together , building a peaceful future on the basis of a federal solution .
paul murphy : urging move from ira do n't worry , you have n't missed the good friday agreement mark 2 .
the deal in question took place in sri lanka where an estimated 60,000 people have been killed in a conflict which has raged since 1972 .
observers predict that implementing the ground breaking sri lankan agreement might prove difficult .
that 's something unionists and nationalists could tell the tamil tigers and the sinhalese government all about .
in northern ireland , during a fairly quiet political week , david trimble said the ira must end their love affair with the gun .
' predictions ' however , gerry adams complained that , so far , the stormont talks have achieved practically nothing .
sinn fein wants the british and irish governments to produce a precise timetable for implementing all aspects of the good friday agreement .
but after a week in the united states talking to senior bush administration officials , secretary of state paul murphy retorted that there must be moves from the ira .
gerry adams : " stormont talks have achieved practically nothing " the pessimistic republican rhetoric of recent days looks like a reaction to the predictions in london newspapers a week ago that the ira was ready to wind up much of its activity .
even if there is some truth to such reports , they did little to help the sinn fein leadership 's public negotiating position .
perhaps under the immediate impression that the reports emanated from british sources , martin mcguinness criticised them as intended to undermine the process .
loyalist decommissioning however , with increasing indications that a briefing by bertie ahern was at the root of it all , mr mcguinness appeared less forthright .
without naming the irish prime minister , he told the bbc 's inside politics programme that people should be more diplomatic about what they say .
local politicians have contrasting views on the merit of hate crime legislation - nationalists and the alliance party are in favour , but unionists harbour doubts apart from pointing to the british and irish governments ' responsibilities , republicans are also emphasising that unionists could do more to build trust .
this explains mr mcguinness 's claim that unionist politicians have failed to use their influence to secure loyalist decommissioning .
it is no coincidence that sinn fein has taken to describing the uda and the uvf as " unionist paramilitaries " rather than loyalists .
with the talks continuing at a glacial speed , scotland has stolen a march on northern ireland by pioneering a package of anti-sectarian proposals .
' secret shame ' the package - in response to soccer violence in glasgow - may lead to religious hatred being classed as an aggravating motive for any criminal offence .
the northern ireland office is currently looking for responses to a consultation paper on racial and sectarian crime .
it was issued , presumably without any intended irony , on guy fawkes ' day .
local politicians have contrasting views on the merit of " hate crime " legislation .
nationalists and the alliance party are in favour , but unionists harbour doubts .
scottish first minister jack mcconnell described sectarianism as scotland 's " secret shame " .
in northern ireland , it is a very public shame and one suspects that the sheer size of the problem explains why it has yet to be tackled in such a direct manner .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- analysis : tense times for saudi arabia news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : middle east news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help languages editions change to uk saturday , 7 december , 2002 , 11:25 gmt analysis : tense times for saudi arabia ties have come under strain since 11 september by tarik kafala bbc news online an air of crisis has surrounded saudi arabia and its ruling family since 11 september 2001 .
all but four of the 19 men who carried out the suicide attacks are believed to have been saudis and the man believed to be behind the attacks , osama bin laden , was a saudi citizen .
wherever the americans turn , when it comes to the number one issue for them today , somehow they find saudis abdulrahman al-rashed newspaper editor the most immediate consequence of this has been a serious deterioration in the close strategic relationship between the united states and saudi arabia that has endured for more than 50 years .
" wherever the americans turn , when it comes to the number one issue for them today , somehow they find saudis , " abdulrahman al-rashed , a saudi and the editor of as-sharq al-awsat , one of the arab world 's leading newspapers , told bbc news online .
gregory gause , a saudi specialist at the university of vermont in the us , agrees .
" with 15 of the 19 hijackers being from saudi - a figure that every american now knows - americans started looking at the relationship with a much more critical eye .
" on a political level , two important groups that had basically accepted the relationship as a strategic necessity became open opponents of the relationship : the neo-conservatives and the christian right .
these are two bedrock constituencies of the republican party , " mr gause told bbc news online .
' with us or against us ' and now , as the us gears up for war in iraq , saudi arabia is again being pulled centre stage .
its lack of public support for us ambitions in iraq puts saudi arabia on the wrong side of president george w bush 's " you are either with us of against us " formulation .
so far , riyadh has neither allowed us use of bases on its soil for a campaign against iraq , nor absolutely discounted the possibility .
the us government still very publicly supports the relationship with the saud family , and vice versa , because both elites know the value of the relationship at a strategic level - oil and regional security are extremely important gregory gause vermont university " the saudis can not just open up their gates .
they have a lot at stake .
saudi arabia has the longest border with iraq of any neighbour .
" should the americans decide tomorrow that there is not going to be a war in iraq , the kingdom will be stuck with a difficult situation , " mr rashed said .
" i think that the saudis will eventually join the americans once the war is really under way .
they want to see concrete preparations for the war and international backing for it . "
support for al-qaeda if it backs washington over iraq , some analysts say the saudi government risks being swept away by a public backlash in a country where anti-american sentiment is rising and bin laden and his al-qaeda network are believed to be very popular .
mr rashed says this is alarmist .
" support for al-qaeda is certainly a great difficulty for the saudi royal family , but it 's an exaggeration to say that it can cause enough instability to overthrow them .
osama bin laden looms over deteriorating us-saudi relations " there is opposition in the mosques and there are fiery speeches denouncing the americans and openly backing bin laden , but that 's it at the moment . "
officially , saudi arabia blames pretty much all internal unrest on hostile elements from outside the kingdom .
a series of continuing small bomb attacks have been blamed on rivalries between westerners trading in prohibited alcohol .
many observers say they are attacks by islamic militants targeted at the western presence in the country .
however , the saudi interior minister admitted for the first time in november 2002 that the authorities were holding about 100 saudi nationals on terrorism-related charges .
this may be a sign that the government is getting serious about clamping down on its own militants .
mixed signals us officials have in private been scathing about the co-operation offered by the saudi authorities in the us 's " war on terror " .
mr rashed believes the us is giving mixed signals on this .
" this a big mess .
you have us agencies , such as the fbi , that are pleased with the level of co-operation they are getting .
then you have some -lrb- in the -rrb- defence department and some of the advisers at the white house who are very critical of saudi arabia .
in the middle is the state department .
oil interests may well keep us-saudi relations going " the saudi authorities are not clear or helpful when it comes to speaking to the media .
the absence of official saudi comment has complicated things .
they have been misunderstood by the americans . "
some in washington believe saudi arabia is not doing all it can to stop funding to al-qaeda and other militant islamic groups .
revelations that the wife of the saudi ambassador to washington may have donated money that , perhaps inadvertently , made its way to the 11 september hijackers , have been very damaging .
mr gause does not believe this damage is irreparable .
" the us government still very publicly supports the relationship with the saud family , and vice versa , because both elites know the value of the relationship at a strategic level - oil and regional security are extremely important . "
' the iraqi option ' though saudi and us officials play this down , analysts have a theory that washington sees saudi arabia as an increasingly unstable ally and is hoping to establish iraq , post-saddam hussein , as an alternative source of cheap and plentiful oil .
the removal of us troops from saudi arabia is bin laden 's priority under this scenario , the privileged ally status that saudi arabia has enjoyed for more that 50 years would end , as us dependence on the kingdom declines .
in august this year , the influential rand corporation gave a startling briefing to the pentagon which painted saudi arabia as an unstable source of terrorism .
the report suggested that the us military should seize the saudi oilfields .
" for a very long time , i have not seen the saudi officials as nervous and panicky and confused as they were just after that pentagon briefing .
" us officials have since gone to great lengths to reassure the saudis that what was said in the briefing was just a briefing , and that none of it was policy , " mr rashed said .
mr gause also thinks that the us administration does not buy into the views expressed by the rand briefing .
" this kind of loose talk about capturing oilfields is so easy to spout out in briefings or in opinion columns .
" some people in the administration might be thinking along these lines , but it shows that they do not understand the world oil market .
" iraqi oil will not ' belong ' to the us after regime change .
this is not the 1920s .
and it is still hard to see down the line how the world can do without saudi oil production . "
