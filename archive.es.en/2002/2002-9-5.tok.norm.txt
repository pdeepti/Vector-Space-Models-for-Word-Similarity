11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.09.2002 “ i thought we were in the middle of armageddon ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrator art spiegelman pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist and author art spiegelman personally witnessed the september 11 attacks in new york .
in an interview with dw-world he talked about fear , racism in america and his jewish identity . art spiegelman is best known as the author and illustrator of maus i : a survivor ’ s tale and maus ii , a holocaust saga in which jewish mice are exterminated by nazi cats .
he was awarded the pulitzer prize in 1992 for the maus series .
in recent years , spiegelman has also illustrated several covers for the new yorker magazine .
he is also co-founder and editor of raw , the acclaimed avant-garde comics magazine .
beginning today , spiegelman will also exclusively publish a comic series on september 11 called in the shadow of no towers -lrb- photos -rrb- in the german weekly newspaper die zeit for a full year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman in an exclusive interview with dw-world in berlin , art spiegelman reflected on the sept .
11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '
but it was the world they knew and that 's how i felt about myself and new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman afterwards -lrb- after the september 11 attacks -rrb- , in my head it was still sept 11th 8:45. a.m.
it was n't even reasonably going away at that point .
not only did n't i leave the city , i barely left my lower manhattan neighborhood .
i wanted to be as close to the house as possible .
when i go uptown i feel confused because people did n't experience it the same way .
i thought how callous these people are .
there are away in some other universe where everything is just normal to them .
there is a different way of perceiving , an insane aristocracy of suffering .
i guess that every block from the epicenter brought a different perspective .
one year later , do you feel that there is a new wave of racism in the united states ?
actually , i am impressed by how much little violent hate crime has been directed against arabs after the first few weeks .
what is true is that there are forces in the american government that are using the events of september 11 to justify an agenda that seem to include the curtailing of civil liberties .
i think personally we 've lived through a peaceful coup d ' etat .
everything which has happened since has been an implementation of a government i found myself unhappy with .
i have no interest in going to war with sadam hussein personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman why is your comic on the 11th of september not published in an american newspaper ?
i am too european for americans .
my vantage point is not a mainstream american one .
i created a german-jewish access of publishing .
my news is disaster .
the news that gets me to work is not to draw beautiful women , wine and palm trees .
what makes me focus my attention i suppose is the memento mori - that thing that reminds you are dying rather sooner than later .
i realized ' spiegelman , you 've been working on essays and a play but comics only got occasional attention from you .

in august , 4,018,200 germans were jobless .
though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .
but there is a silver lining in the figures : unemployment in germany 's economically disadvantaged eastern states , formerly belonging to communist east germany , showed a sharp decline in unemployment , with 23,600 more people finding themselves gainful employment than in the previous month .
the government partially attributed that shift to new employment opportunities related to clean up and reconstruction following last month 's devastating floods in the areas surrounding the elbe river . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .
but there is a silver lining in the figures : unemployment in germany 's economically disadvantaged eastern states , formerly belonging to communist east germany , showed a sharp decline in unemployment , with 23,600 more people finding themselves gainful employment than in the previous month .
the government partially attributed that shift to new employment opportunities related to clean up and reconstruction following last month 's devastating floods in the areas surrounding the elbe river . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman in an exclusive interview with dw-world in berlin , art spiegelman reflected on the sept .
11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '
but it was the world they knew and that 's how i felt about myself and new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman afterwards -lrb- after the september 11 attacks -rrb- , in my head it was still sept 11th 8:45. a.m.
it was n't even reasonably going away at that point .
not only did n't i leave the city , i barely left my lower manhattan neighborhood .
i wanted to be as close to the house as possible .
when i go uptown i feel confused because people did n't experience it the same way .
i thought how callous these people are .
there are away in some other universe where everything is just normal to them .
there is a different way of perceiving , an insane aristocracy of suffering .
i guess that every block from the epicenter brought a different perspective .
one year later , do you feel that there is a new wave of racism in the united states ?
actually , i am impressed by how much little violent hate crime has been directed against arabs after the first few weeks .
what is true is that there are forces in the american government that are using the events of september 11 to justify an agenda that seem to include the curtailing of civil liberties .
i think personally we 've lived through a peaceful coup d ' etat .
everything which has happened since has been an implementation of a government i found myself unhappy with .
i have no interest in going to war with sadam hussein personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman why is your comic on the 11th of september not published in an american newspaper ?
i am too european for americans .
my vantage point is not a mainstream american one .
i created a german-jewish access of publishing .
my news is disaster .
the news that gets me to work is not to draw beautiful women , wine and palm trees .
what makes me focus my attention i suppose is the memento mori - that thing that reminds you are dying rather sooner than later .
i realized ' spiegelman , you 've been working on essays and a play but comics only got occasional attention from you .

that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '
but it was the world they knew and that 's how i felt about myself and new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman afterwards -lrb- after the september 11 attacks -rrb- , in my head it was still sept 11th 8:45. a.m.
it was n't even reasonably going away at that point .
not only did n't i leave the city , i barely left my lower manhattan neighborhood .
i wanted to be as close to the house as possible .
when i go uptown i feel confused because people did n't experience it the same way .
i thought how callous these people are .
there are away in some other universe where everything is just normal to them .
there is a different way of perceiving , an insane aristocracy of suffering .
i guess that every block from the epicenter brought a different perspective .
one year later , do you feel that there is a new wave of racism in the united states ?
actually , i am impressed by how much little violent hate crime has been directed against arabs after the first few weeks .
what is true is that there are forces in the american government that are using the events of september 11 to justify an agenda that seem to include the curtailing of civil liberties .
i think personally we 've lived through a peaceful coup d ' etat .
everything which has happened since has been an implementation of a government i found myself unhappy with .
i have no interest in going to war with sadam hussein personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman why is your comic on the 11th of september not published in an american newspaper ?
i am too european for americans .
my vantage point is not a mainstream american one .
i created a german-jewish access of publishing .
my news is disaster .
the news that gets me to work is not to draw beautiful women , wine and palm trees .
what makes me focus my attention i suppose is the memento mori - that thing that reminds you are dying rather sooner than later .
i realized ' spiegelman , you 've been working on essays and a play but comics only got occasional attention from you .
you are gonna to die and you spent the last years without doing comics at all . ' " the interview was conducted by petra tabeling send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

in august , 4,018,200 germans were jobless .
though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .
but there is a silver lining in the figures : unemployment in germany 's economically disadvantaged eastern states , formerly belonging to communist east germany , showed a sharp decline in unemployment , with 23,600 more people finding themselves gainful employment than in the previous month .

in an interview with dw-world he talked about fear , racism in america and his jewish identity . art spiegelman is best known as the author and illustrator of maus i : a survivor ’ s tale and maus ii , a holocaust saga in which jewish mice are exterminated by nazi cats .
he was awarded the pulitzer prize in 1992 for the maus series .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman in an exclusive interview with dw-world in berlin , art spiegelman reflected on the sept .
11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .

in august , 4,018,200 germans were jobless .
though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .
but there is a silver lining in the figures : unemployment in germany 's economically disadvantaged eastern states , formerly belonging to communist east germany , showed a sharp decline in unemployment , with 23,600 more people finding themselves gainful employment than in the previous month .
the government partially attributed that shift to new employment opportunities related to clean up and reconstruction following last month 's devastating floods in the areas surrounding the elbe river . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman in an exclusive interview with dw-world in berlin , art spiegelman reflected on the sept .
11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '
but it was the world they knew and that 's how i felt about myself and new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman afterwards -lrb- after the september 11 attacks -rrb- , in my head it was still sept 11th 8:45. a.m.
it was n't even reasonably going away at that point .
not only did n't i leave the city , i barely left my lower manhattan neighborhood .
i wanted to be as close to the house as possible .
when i go uptown i feel confused because people did n't experience it the same way .
i thought how callous these people are .

in august , 4,018,200 germans were jobless .
though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.09.2002 “ i thought we were in the middle of armageddon ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrator art spiegelman pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist and author art spiegelman personally witnessed the september 11 attacks in new york .
in an interview with dw-world he talked about fear , racism in america and his jewish identity . art spiegelman is best known as the author and illustrator of maus i : a survivor ’ s tale and maus ii , a holocaust saga in which jewish mice are exterminated by nazi cats .
he was awarded the pulitzer prize in 1992 for the maus series .
in recent years , spiegelman has also illustrated several covers for the new yorker magazine .
he is also co-founder and editor of raw , the acclaimed avant-garde comics magazine .
beginning today , spiegelman will also exclusively publish a comic series on september 11 called in the shadow of no towers -lrb- photos -rrb- in the german weekly newspaper die zeit for a full year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman in an exclusive interview with dw-world in berlin , art spiegelman reflected on the sept .
11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '
but it was the world they knew and that 's how i felt about myself and new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman afterwards -lrb- after the september 11 attacks -rrb- , in my head it was still sept 11th 8:45. a.m.
it was n't even reasonably going away at that point .
not only did n't i leave the city , i barely left my lower manhattan neighborhood .
i wanted to be as close to the house as possible .
when i go uptown i feel confused because people did n't experience it the same way .
i thought how callous these people are .
there are away in some other universe where everything is just normal to them .
there is a different way of perceiving , an insane aristocracy of suffering .
i guess that every block from the epicenter brought a different perspective .
one year later , do you feel that there is a new wave of racism in the united states ?
actually , i am impressed by how much little violent hate crime has been directed against arabs after the first few weeks .
what is true is that there are forces in the american government that are using the events of september 11 to justify an agenda that seem to include the curtailing of civil liberties .
i think personally we 've lived through a peaceful coup d ' etat .
everything which has happened since has been an implementation of a government i found myself unhappy with .
i have no interest in going to war with sadam hussein personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman why is your comic on the 11th of september not published in an american newspaper ?
i am too european for americans .
my vantage point is not a mainstream american one .
i created a german-jewish access of publishing .
my news is disaster .
the news that gets me to work is not to draw beautiful women , wine and palm trees .
what makes me focus my attention i suppose is the memento mori - that thing that reminds you are dying rather sooner than later .
i realized ' spiegelman , you 've been working on essays and a play but comics only got occasional attention from you .
you are gonna to die and you spent the last years without doing comics at all . ' " the interview was conducted by petra tabeling send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman in an exclusive interview with dw-world in berlin , art spiegelman reflected on the sept .
11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '
but it was the world they knew and that 's how i felt about myself and new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman afterwards -lrb- after the september 11 attacks -rrb- , in my head it was still sept 11th 8:45. a.m.
it was n't even reasonably going away at that point .
not only did n't i leave the city , i barely left my lower manhattan neighborhood .
i wanted to be as close to the house as possible .
when i go uptown i feel confused because people did n't experience it the same way .
i thought how callous these people are .
there are away in some other universe where everything is just normal to them .
there is a different way of perceiving , an insane aristocracy of suffering .
i guess that every block from the epicenter brought a different perspective .
one year later , do you feel that there is a new wave of racism in the united states ?
actually , i am impressed by how much little violent hate crime has been directed against arabs after the first few weeks .
what is true is that there are forces in the american government that are using the events of september 11 to justify an agenda that seem to include the curtailing of civil liberties .
i think personally we 've lived through a peaceful coup d ' etat .
everything which has happened since has been an implementation of a government i found myself unhappy with .
i have no interest in going to war with sadam hussein personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman why is your comic on the 11th of september not published in an american newspaper ?
i am too european for americans .
my vantage point is not a mainstream american one .
i created a german-jewish access of publishing .
my news is disaster .
the news that gets me to work is not to draw beautiful women , wine and palm trees .
what makes me focus my attention i suppose is the memento mori - that thing that reminds you are dying rather sooner than later .
i realized ' spiegelman , you 've been working on essays and a play but comics only got occasional attention from you .

in august , 4,018,200 germans were jobless .
though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .
but there is a silver lining in the figures : unemployment in germany 's economically disadvantaged eastern states , formerly belonging to communist east germany , showed a sharp decline in unemployment , with 23,600 more people finding themselves gainful employment than in the previous month .
the government partially attributed that shift to new employment opportunities related to clean up and reconstruction following last month 's devastating floods in the areas surrounding the elbe river . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in august , 4,018,200 germans were jobless .
though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .

in an interview with dw-world he talked about fear , racism in america and his jewish identity . art spiegelman is best known as the author and illustrator of maus i : a survivor ’ s tale and maus ii , a holocaust saga in which jewish mice are exterminated by nazi cats .
he was awarded the pulitzer prize in 1992 for the maus series .
in recent years , spiegelman has also illustrated several covers for the new yorker magazine .
he is also co-founder and editor of raw , the acclaimed avant-garde comics magazine .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman in an exclusive interview with dw-world in berlin , art spiegelman reflected on the sept .
11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '
but it was the world they knew and that 's how i felt about myself and new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman afterwards -lrb- after the september 11 attacks -rrb- , in my head it was still sept 11th 8:45. a.m.
it was n't even reasonably going away at that point .
not only did n't i leave the city , i barely left my lower manhattan neighborhood .
i wanted to be as close to the house as possible .
when i go uptown i feel confused because people did n't experience it the same way .
i thought how callous these people are .
there are away in some other universe where everything is just normal to them .
there is a different way of perceiving , an insane aristocracy of suffering .
i guess that every block from the epicenter brought a different perspective .
one year later , do you feel that there is a new wave of racism in the united states ?
actually , i am impressed by how much little violent hate crime has been directed against arabs after the first few weeks .
what is true is that there are forces in the american government that are using the events of september 11 to justify an agenda that seem to include the curtailing of civil liberties .
i think personally we 've lived through a peaceful coup d ' etat .
everything which has happened since has been an implementation of a government i found myself unhappy with .
i have no interest in going to war with sadam hussein personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman why is your comic on the 11th of september not published in an american newspaper ?
i am too european for americans .
my vantage point is not a mainstream american one .
i created a german-jewish access of publishing .
my news is disaster .
the news that gets me to work is not to draw beautiful women , wine and palm trees .
what makes me focus my attention i suppose is the memento mori - that thing that reminds you are dying rather sooner than later .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.09.2002 “ i thought we were in the middle of armageddon ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrator art spiegelman pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist and author art spiegelman personally witnessed the september 11 attacks in new york .
in an interview with dw-world he talked about fear , racism in america and his jewish identity . art spiegelman is best known as the author and illustrator of maus i : a survivor ’ s tale and maus ii , a holocaust saga in which jewish mice are exterminated by nazi cats .
he was awarded the pulitzer prize in 1992 for the maus series .
in recent years , spiegelman has also illustrated several covers for the new yorker magazine .
he is also co-founder and editor of raw , the acclaimed avant-garde comics magazine .
beginning today , spiegelman will also exclusively publish a comic series on september 11 called in the shadow of no towers -lrb- photos -rrb- in the german weekly newspaper die zeit for a full year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman in an exclusive interview with dw-world in berlin , art spiegelman reflected on the sept .
11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '

in august , 4,018,200 germans were jobless .
though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .
but there is a silver lining in the figures : unemployment in germany 's economically disadvantaged eastern states , formerly belonging to communist east germany , showed a sharp decline in unemployment , with 23,600 more people finding themselves gainful employment than in the previous month .
the government partially attributed that shift to new employment opportunities related to clean up and reconstruction following last month 's devastating floods in the areas surrounding the elbe river . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .
but there is a silver lining in the figures : unemployment in germany 's economically disadvantaged eastern states , formerly belonging to communist east germany , showed a sharp decline in unemployment , with 23,600 more people finding themselves gainful employment than in the previous month .
the government partially attributed that shift to new employment opportunities related to clean up and reconstruction following last month 's devastating floods in the areas surrounding the elbe river . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman in an exclusive interview with dw-world in berlin , art spiegelman reflected on the sept .
11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '
but it was the world they knew and that 's how i felt about myself and new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman afterwards -lrb- after the september 11 attacks -rrb- , in my head it was still sept 11th 8:45. a.m.
it was n't even reasonably going away at that point .
not only did n't i leave the city , i barely left my lower manhattan neighborhood .
i wanted to be as close to the house as possible .
when i go uptown i feel confused because people did n't experience it the same way .
i thought how callous these people are .
there are away in some other universe where everything is just normal to them .
there is a different way of perceiving , an insane aristocracy of suffering .
i guess that every block from the epicenter brought a different perspective .
one year later , do you feel that there is a new wave of racism in the united states ?
actually , i am impressed by how much little violent hate crime has been directed against arabs after the first few weeks .
what is true is that there are forces in the american government that are using the events of september 11 to justify an agenda that seem to include the curtailing of civil liberties .
i think personally we 've lived through a peaceful coup d ' etat .
everything which has happened since has been an implementation of a government i found myself unhappy with .
i have no interest in going to war with sadam hussein personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman why is your comic on the 11th of september not published in an american newspaper ?
i am too european for americans .
my vantage point is not a mainstream american one .
i created a german-jewish access of publishing .
my news is disaster .
the news that gets me to work is not to draw beautiful women , wine and palm trees .
what makes me focus my attention i suppose is the memento mori - that thing that reminds you are dying rather sooner than later .
i realized ' spiegelman , you 've been working on essays and a play but comics only got occasional attention from you .

in august , 4,018,200 germans were jobless .
though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .
but there is a silver lining in the figures : unemployment in germany 's economically disadvantaged eastern states , formerly belonging to communist east germany , showed a sharp decline in unemployment , with 23,600 more people finding themselves gainful employment than in the previous month .
the government partially attributed that shift to new employment opportunities related to clean up and reconstruction following last month 's devastating floods in the areas surrounding the elbe river . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '
but it was the world they knew and that 's how i felt about myself and new york .

i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .

in august , 4,018,200 germans were jobless .
though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .
but there is a silver lining in the figures : unemployment in germany 's economically disadvantaged eastern states , formerly belonging to communist east germany , showed a sharp decline in unemployment , with 23,600 more people finding themselves gainful employment than in the previous month .
the government partially attributed that shift to new employment opportunities related to clean up and reconstruction following last month 's devastating floods in the areas surrounding the elbe river . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.09.2002 “ i thought we were in the middle of armageddon ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrator art spiegelman pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist and author art spiegelman personally witnessed the september 11 attacks in new york .
in an interview with dw-world he talked about fear , racism in america and his jewish identity . art spiegelman is best known as the author and illustrator of maus i : a survivor ’ s tale and maus ii , a holocaust saga in which jewish mice are exterminated by nazi cats .
he was awarded the pulitzer prize in 1992 for the maus series .
in recent years , spiegelman has also illustrated several covers for the new yorker magazine .
he is also co-founder and editor of raw , the acclaimed avant-garde comics magazine .
beginning today , spiegelman will also exclusively publish a comic series on september 11 called in the shadow of no towers -lrb- photos -rrb- in the german weekly newspaper die zeit for a full year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman in an exclusive interview with dw-world in berlin , art spiegelman reflected on the sept .
11 attacks and his jewish identity .
mr. spiegelman , where were you on the morning of september 11th ?
it was a morning on which my wife and i had just gone out of our lower manhattan loft to go vote , it was a primary -lrb- election -rrb- day .
we live 12 , maybe 15 blocks from the world trade center .
as we were walking north , we heard a plane roar overhead and then we heard this crashing sound .
we turned around just after the plane went into the building .
at that point we both began to worry about our daughter because she had just started to go to a school right below the towers .
i went upstairs to call the school .
while i was trying to get through , i turned on the tv to find out what happened .
all of a sudden we heard this other crash on the tv screen and we saw the second tower .
at that time my wife went bizarre and shouted : " just go to the school right away ! ' .
when people began to run out of the neighborhood , we were beginning to run in .
while i was in the school lobby i could n't see what was going outside .
listening to the spanish radio , i heard the word ' pentagon ' .
at that point i had no point of reference anymore .
it just seemed somehow we were in the middle of armageddon .
at some point the building shook .
i thought : we are gonna die in this building .
that was the moment when the first tower fell , as i found out later .
i found my daughter and only five minutes later we were back on the street when we heard a sound like a waterfall roaring " sssh " it was the tower - all that was left were the glowing bones of the building , there was no building anymore .
my wife francoise , nadja and i turned back into the corner of our street and it made me realize for the first time in my life how much i really like my street .
i think i now understand why the jews didn ' t leave berlin after kristallnacht .
what connection is there between the third reich , reichskristallnacht , and the 11th of september ?
i grew up with parents who both survived auschwitz .
i lived my comfortable american life and yet grew up with this implicit understanding that you are walking on eggshells .
i was clearly in the middle of something that was the ugly skull , the grinning face of history knocking on our front door in our neighborhood .
my connection to the kristallnacht moment had to do with ' why on earth , when it became clear that this was not a safe place to be if you are a jew , why did n't everybody just pack up and go ? '
but it was the world they knew and that 's how i felt about myself and new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman afterwards -lrb- after the september 11 attacks -rrb- , in my head it was still sept 11th 8:45. a.m.
it was n't even reasonably going away at that point .
not only did n't i leave the city , i barely left my lower manhattan neighborhood .
i wanted to be as close to the house as possible .
when i go uptown i feel confused because people did n't experience it the same way .
i thought how callous these people are .
there are away in some other universe where everything is just normal to them .
there is a different way of perceiving , an insane aristocracy of suffering .
i guess that every block from the epicenter brought a different perspective .
one year later , do you feel that there is a new wave of racism in the united states ?
actually , i am impressed by how much little violent hate crime has been directed against arabs after the first few weeks .
what is true is that there are forces in the american government that are using the events of september 11 to justify an agenda that seem to include the curtailing of civil liberties .
i think personally we 've lived through a peaceful coup d ' etat .
everything which has happened since has been an implementation of a government i found myself unhappy with .
i have no interest in going to war with sadam hussein personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , art spiegelman why is your comic on the 11th of september not published in an american newspaper ?
i am too european for americans .
my vantage point is not a mainstream american one .
i created a german-jewish access of publishing .
my news is disaster .
the news that gets me to work is not to draw beautiful women , wine and palm trees .
what makes me focus my attention i suppose is the memento mori - that thing that reminds you are dying rather sooner than later .
i realized ' spiegelman , you 've been working on essays and a play but comics only got occasional attention from you .
you are gonna to die and you spent the last years without doing comics at all . ' " the interview was conducted by petra tabeling send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

in august , 4,018,200 germans were jobless .
though the figure remained above the psychologically important four-million mark , there were 28,700 fewer unemployed germans than in the previous month , which could bring some good news to chancellor gerhard schröder 's reelection bid .
in contrast to the previous year , however , the figures were less bright .
229,400 more people found themselves without work in august than during the same period last year .
at the same time , the unemployment rate in august did decrease from 9.7 to 9.6 percent .
releasing the figures on thursday , florian gerster , head of the federal labor office in nuremburg , said germany was still in the beginning phase of an economic recovery .
for that reason , he said , the labor market had still not improved significantly .
gerster said he was optimistic that the unemployment rate would fall below the four million mark during the months of september and october .
he offered less optimism for a full recovery for the german economy , which he now forecasts can first happen at the start of the new year .
gerster said seasonal factors contributed to the slight decrease in unemployment figures .
if those factors are stripped from the figure , however , there was an actual increase of 2,000 unemployed people during the month of august , with a total of 4.104 million .
the social democrats sought to play down that increase on thursday .
federal labor minister walter riester said the labor market is already showing signs of improvement .
after dropping seasonal factors , he said , the increase in the unemployment rate had virtually come to a halt .
" this is a harbinger of the easing of the labor market that we are expecting during the second half of the year , " he said .
but there is a silver lining in the figures : unemployment in germany 's economically disadvantaged eastern states , formerly belonging to communist east germany , showed a sharp decline in unemployment , with 23,600 more people finding themselves gainful employment than in the previous month .

the cuts relate to with-profits policies , which are long terms funds that usually smooth out dips in the stock market over the length of the policy .
but the sustained falls of the last two years have forced a number of insurance groups to cut bonus payments for cashing in a policy .
prudential had avoided any reduction in bonus rates until now , but said on thursday that they could be cut by 5 % to 10 % .
the insurance giant 's chief executive , mark wood , said : " this is a prudent move to protect the strong financial position of the fund " .
the decision follows a 2.6 % fall in the value of the with-profits funds during the first half of 2002 .

speaking to the bbc , mr fernando said that the sri lankan government 's decision on wednesday to lift its ban on the tamil tiger rebel movement marked an important step .
he also said that there would be no formal agenda for the discussions but that anything short of a separate tamil state would be debated .
the tigers , one of the world 's most ruthless rebel groups , have been fighting for an independent homeland for the island 's minority tamil community since 1983 .
mr fernando said : " we go on the basis that once they agreed to talks ... it was a very significant move by them that they are seriously exploring the possibility of settling this problem other than through their demands for a separate state , " he said .
" i 'm convinced they are certainly trying to -lsb- give up violence and -rsb- ... settle for something ...
they are under enormous pressure from their own people and so are we . "
the foreign minister also said that he hoped by bringing the rebel movement into " the democratic process " it would render violence " unnecessary " .
talks due the rebels had insisted on recognition as a precondition for their attendance at the talks .
the government - which originally promised to lift the four-year-old ban only in the days leading up to the negotiations - said it had taken the decision to do so earlier to express trust and confidence in the tamil tigers .
the sides are due to meet in thailand on 16 september for formal peace talks to try to end the bitter ethnic conflict , in which about 65,000 people have died .
presidential opposition in an initial reaction , sri lankan president chandrika kumaratunga said she would " go along " with the decision .
however , mrs kumaratunga had previously made clear that she opposes lifting the ban .
government moves in the norwegian-mediated peace process have led to a deepening crisis between the president and prime minister , who are from opposing parties .
the government has been discussing with her its plans to limit her powers to dissolve parliament , fearing she could use them to scupper any future peace deal the government reaches with the tamil tigers .
the president met prime minister ranil wickramasinghe on tuesday , but it was not clear if they had reached any agreement .
mrs kumaratunga is reported to have warned the government on monday that there were legal options open to her should the government remove the ban on the tamil tigers without her consent .
emotive issue the ban was imposed in 1998 after the tigers attacked the temple of the tooth in kandy , the holiest buddhist shrine in sri lanka .
the rebels made its removal a main precondition for sitting down to talks with the government .
the bbc 's frances harrison , reporting from rebel-held northern sri lanka , says the decision has been greeted with delight there .
she adds that the move is hugely symbolic for the tigers , although it is unlikely to make much practical difference .
under the terms of a ceasefire brokered by the norwegians in february , the tigers can already operate political offices in government-controlled territory .
the rebels are still banned in some other countries , such as the us and the uk and india .
it is thought unlikely they will lift the ban before peace talks make substantial progress .

the tamil tigers have been fighting for independence since 1983 speaking to the bbc , mr fernando said that the sri lankan government 's decision on wednesday to lift its ban on the tamil tiger rebel movement marked an important step .
he also said that there would be no formal agenda for the discussions but that anything short of a separate tamil state would be debated .
the tigers , one of the world 's most ruthless rebel groups , have been fighting for an independent homeland for the island 's minority tamil community since 1983 .
mr fernando said : " we go on the basis that once they agreed to talks ... it was a very significant move by them that they are seriously exploring the possibility of settling this problem other than through their demands for a separate state , " he said .
" i 'm convinced they are certainly trying to -lsb- give up violence and -rsb- ... settle for something ...
they are under enormous pressure from their own people and so are we . "
the foreign minister also said that he hoped by bringing the rebel movement into " the democratic process " it would render violence " unnecessary " .
talks due the rebels had insisted on recognition as a precondition for their attendance at the talks .
the government - which originally promised to lift the four-year-old ban only in the days leading up to the negotiations - said it had taken the decision to do so earlier to express trust and confidence in the tamil tigers .
the sides are due to meet in thailand on 16 september for formal peace talks to try to end the bitter ethnic conflict , in which about 65,000 people have died .
presidential opposition in an initial reaction , sri lankan president chandrika kumaratunga said she would " go along " with the decision .
however , mrs kumaratunga had previously made clear that she opposes lifting the ban .
president kumaratunga : not happy with government moves government moves in the norwegian-mediated peace process have led to a deepening crisis between the president and prime minister , who are from opposing parties .
the government has been discussing with her its plans to limit her powers to dissolve parliament , fearing she could use them to scupper any future peace deal the government reaches with the tamil tigers .
the president met prime minister ranil wickramasinghe on tuesday , but it was not clear if they had reached any agreement .
mrs kumaratunga is reported to have warned the government on monday that there were legal options open to her should the government remove the ban on the tamil tigers without her consent .
emotive issue the ban was imposed in 1998 after the tigers attacked the temple of the tooth in kandy , the holiest buddhist shrine in sri lanka .
nationalist groups want the ban to stay the rebels made its removal a main precondition for sitting down to talks with the government .
the bbc 's frances harrison , reporting from rebel-held northern sri lanka , says the decision has been greeted with delight there .
she adds that the move is hugely symbolic for the tigers , although it is unlikely to make much practical difference .
under the terms of a ceasefire brokered by the norwegians in february , the tigers can already operate political offices in government-controlled territory .
the rebels are still banned in some other countries , such as the us and the uk and india .
it is thought unlikely they will lift the ban before peace talks make substantial progress . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's adam mynott " now the tamil tigers are wearing civilian dress " peace efforts sides keep talking q & a : peace talks child soldiers dispute federal surprise tigers ' changing stripes background children 's scars tamils abroad landmines ethnic divide timeline bbc sinhala service news in sinhala bbc tamil service news in tamil talking point what is the future for sri lanka 's peace talks ?

twenty leading academics from the us and around the world will address members of the us government on thursday as part of a sustained campaign by the government to improve its global image .
there is a genuine sense of confusion amongst many people here in the us about why there should be so much anti-american feeling worldwide .

in a recent poll of the arab world , for example , most people did not believe that any arabs were even involved in the 11 september attacks .
so now the state department has invited leading scholars from around the world to a conference to give their opinions on how to tackle what it describes as anti-americanism .

the group , whose brands include johnny walker whisky , smirnoff vodka and bailey 's irish cream liqueur , said it had achieved its objective in the year to june of transforming itself into a " focused premium drinks company " .
profits in the year were boosted by strong sales of its premium brands including the increasingly popular smirnoff ice .
chief executive paul walsh said the company had maintained its targets for the current year but said the year ahead would be a difficult one .
tough year ahead but mr walsh warned : " as we face continuing difficulties in respect of the economic environment in which we operate , particularly in areas such as latin america , we recognise that it will be challenging to deliver these targets . "
in the year to 30 june , diageo sold its pillsbury brand and bought the seagram spirits and wine businesses .
in july , it announced the sale of its burger king fast-food chain for $ 2.26bn -lrb- £ 1.4bn -rrb- to a group made up of us venture capitalist firms texas pacific and bain capital , together with private equity group goldman sachs capital partners .
" the best way for us to create shareholder value is to further build and grow the brands we already own rather than try and acquire new ones , " mr walsh told the bbc 's world business report .
pre-tax profits for the year were up 3 % to £ 2.043bn , in line with forecasts .
but premium drink sales slowed from 11 % in the first half of the year , to 9 % for the year as a whole . watch / listen on this story paul walsh , diaego chief executive officer " we 've had some great success with innovation " see also : 25 jul 02 -pipe- business diageo agrees burger king sale 12 aug 02 -pipe- business norway bans diageo over vodka promos 27 feb 02 -pipe- business diageo sells malibu rum 21 feb 02 -pipe- business diageo drinks sales soar internet links : diageo the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : hacker breaches credit card security job losses escalate at reuters new sec chief pledges tough line oil prices push higher rwanda denies drc plundering overseas sales drive wal-mart congo 's finance minister resigns blair keeps euro options open links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- pringle chief builds bond street castle news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : business news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business e-commerce economy market data entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk thursday , 5 september , 2002 , 07:13 gmt 08:13 uk pringle chief builds bond street castle ms winser wants to open a castle in bond street by jorn madslien bbc news online business reporter as part of a weekly series on women in business , bbc news online talks to the boss of scottish knitwear maker pringle about its transformation from golf jumper manufacturer to hot fashion designer .
meet kim winser , a woman whose visions of the future are both entertaining and impressive - and , obviously , totally unrealistic .
ms winser has taken pringle beyond golf for surely her ambition to build a scottish castle in london 's bond street is bound to fail ?
and what about her efforts to convince rock star robbie williams , footballer david beckham and actress julia roberts to wear the sort of woolly jumpers that even golfers have rejected as passé ?
laughable !
well , not quite .
just two-and-a-half years into her job as chief executive of the scottish knitwear maker pringle , and the last laugh is on ms winser .
shake-up in 2000 , the hong kong-based clothing magnate kenneth fang approached ms winser during a holiday in edinburgh with an interesting proposal .
" lady in her pearls waiting for her twin set " " he said to me : ' would you run pringle if i bought it ? " ' explains ms winser , who at the time was an executive with the uk retailer marks & spencer .
an opportunity was grasped .
pringle was acquired from the scottish textile group dawson international and withdrawn from the stock market .
and ms winser got to work .
since then she has spent her time headhunting top designers to reinvent the company 's rather stodgy image with new fashion ranges .
she has even launched a youth-oriented advertising campaign - including a poster of a naked lady who ms winser describes as " a lady in her pearls waiting for her twin set " .
pringle 's path to success developing and launching a full lifestyle collection , including shirts , bags , ties and children 's clothing expanding internationally in several markets via agents opening dedicated pringle stores in london , tokyo and possibly in other fashion cities in europe and the us all the while , ms winser insists she has been chipping away at the company 's millions of pounds of losses - a claim impossible to confirm since pringle , as a private company , is not obliged to publish any details about its finances .
" we have repositioned the business , we have employed an extra 100 people since we bought the business in scotland and london , and we have brought in new design offices , " ms winser says .
she vows to break even in three years .
dressing the stars the changes seem to have worked .
ms winser says sales have risen by up to 80 % each season , and the company plans to make its first ever appearance at the london fashion week on 15 september .
one of pringle 's " youth icons " in an itchy top dedicated followers of fashion have been taken in by ms winser 's radical design changes - many a superstar has been photographed during recent months wearing the pringle range .
the company 's marketing material is littered with guest appearances from leading djs , several rock stars , film directors .
and - in an echo of the 1980s when pringle was widely worn by football hooligans - footballers .
" we do have a very wide celebrity list of people wearing pringle , " ms winser says .
" that has been primarily through purchase , " she says , insisting that the firm does not pay these people to wear its clothes .
scottish heritage the next step for ms winser comes later this month when she flings open the doors of the company 's first dedicated retail outlet in the uk - except for its shop at heathrow .
pringle stores in the uk heathrow bond street -lrb- opens in sept -rrb- sloane street -lrb- opens spring 03 -rrb- pringle 's new bond street flagship store , which will have a " castle-like " image , is an attempt to take advantage of the company 's scottish heritage .
" there is a love of vintage , there is a love of heritage , there is a love of really true traditional quality , " ms winser raves .
which , if correct , is clearly a good trend for pringle which was founded as an underwear business in 1815 before achieving fame for taking the argyle pattern from socks to sweaters .
" when we open in bond street , i believe we will be the oldest brand there , " ms winser says .
woman of the moment ms winser 's restructuring of pringle has earned her a fierce reputation as a hard-nosed businesswoman .
ms winser likes to talk to all pringle 's people one of the first things she did after taking over was to ditch many of pringle 's long-standing licensing agreements with factories around the world and cancel sales to mid-market retailers .
but although ms winser acknowledges that she can be quite " firm if things are not moving at the right pace or in the right direction " , she is keen to remain " approachable " .
" i do like to talk to all the different people who work in the company , " ms winser explains .
" i do n't like layers , i do n't like people having to report , i do n't like big reporting structures . "
ordinary ?
and if any of the 300 people she employs feel intimidated by her , she insists it must be " because of the title " .
pringle 's brochures are littered with stars " and then , once people know you , they 'll say : ' you 're just like anybody else , really ' . "
which , in many ways , she is .
as a working mother , ms winser 's life is marked by everyday struggles , such as getting home in time to give her son a bath .
" i have strong limitations -lsb- on how much time i spend working -rsb- because i have a four-year-old son , " ms winser says .
" i do n't think it 's hurt the business . "
instead , her managers get more chances to represent pringle at functions , which should be good both for their individual careers and for the firm , she explains .
and although she still maintains long working hours , ms winser insists that a healthy private life is important to revitalise people who work in a creative industry .
" i love having people to my home , i love cooking , barbequing or just having people call around for a drink .

mr bush is stepping up efforts to rally support for his campaign against saddam hussein and will consult world leaders in the coming week .
he has also promised to seek the approval of congress before launching any military action against iraq .
congress is under pressure to vote on the issue within the next five weeks , before it adjourns for mid-term elections .

iraq has tied the issue of arms to ending the un embargo " saddam hussein is a serious threat ...
doing nothing about that threat is not an option for the united states , " he said .
he told reporters that when he addresses the un general assembly on 12 september , he would lay out his case against the government in baghdad - which washington accuses of developing weapons of mass destruction .
" i will first remind the united nations that for 11 long years saddam hussein has sidestepped , crawfished , wheedled out of any agreement he made not to develop weapons of mass destruction , " he told reporters .

the company said 4,500 jobs would go this year , and underperforming businesses would be disposed of , to try to achieve savings of $ 1bn by the end of 2002 .
some 2,000 of the job cuts are expected to be in the uk .
zurich 's new internet bank - zurich bank - will close next spring .
the company said customers would be paid at least £ 200 compensation and their accounts would be transferred to other banks .
slashing costs in the uk , zurich financial is best known for its sponsorship of club rugby , as well as being the firm behind insurers eagle star and allied dunbar .
the firm slumped to a net loss of $ 2.03bn in the first six months of this year , from the $ 861m profit recorded a year earlier , mainly because of write-offs and a substantial increase in provisions for poor performance .
underlying this is the weak performance of world stock markets over the past six months , which has seriously eroded the value of the assets held by insurance companies , generally the world 's biggest investors .
in an effort to claw itself back to profitability , zurich said it would sell $ 2bn- $ 2.5bn in new shares next month , and would strive to slash costs across the board .
ups and downs most insurers have suffered in the wake of 11 september , but the losses have more to do with feeble stock markets than direct insured costs .
indeed , big insurers have been able to raise their premiums : zurich recorded an 18 % jump in premium income during the half-year .
now , in the hope of boosting its capital base , zurich is to trim the amount of shares it holds to just 10 % of its portfolio , a very low weighting by fund-management standards .

cannabis possession and consumption should not be treated as a criminal issue at all but as a social and public health issue , the committee concluded .
amnesty the senators recommended an amnesty for any canadian who currently has a criminal record for marijuana possession .
" there is no good reason to subject the consumers of cannabis to the application of criminal law , " senator pierre nolin of the progressive conservative party said .
cannabis use ' should be treated as a public health issue ' " in a free society as ours , it 's up to the individual to decide whether to consume cannabis or not . "
but the committee said there must be a strong emphasis on tackling illegal trafficking and on education programmes aimed at drug prevention .
the senators said they believe canadian public opinion on marijuana is more liberal than it was a decade ago .
opposition but the recommendations do not have cross-party support .
randy white of the opposition canadian alliance party predicted an outcry from canada 's powerful neighbour .
" should canada go ahead with legalisation of marijuana , there is going to be some significant problems with the americans and we should n't underestimate that , " he said .
the us has already complained to the canadian authorities about marijuana grown and trafficked from canada 's west coast .
the canadian police association also opposed the move , calling the recommendations " irresponsible " .
it will be up to the country 's auditor general and justice minister to respond to the senators and decide whether to go ahead with legislation to legalise marijuana in canada .
