lord browne 's pay packet increased from Â£ 1.9m in 2000 to slightly more than Â£ 3m last year , it was stated in the company 's annual report .
his basic pay rose from Â£ 869,000 to Â£ 1.2m , but he was also given a performance bonus and expenses .
lord browne also received shares worth Â£ 2.6m and 1.2 million share options - taking his total benefits package to about Â£ 6.2m.
a Â£ 3m salary is : Â£ 57,692 a week Â£ 8,241 a day Â£ 343 an hour Â£ 5.72 a minute bp defended the rise , saying 53-year-old lord browne was " worth every penny " .
but bill morris , general secretary of the transport and general workers union , said : " some fat cats are bigger than others , but this one is clearly the biggest .
" he has certainly set the pace for bp and other oil company workers .
he was probably too busy to notice , but petrol prices went up yesterday for ordinary , hard-working motorists . "
union officials also pointed out bp had offered a 3 % pay rise this year to workers in its offshore business .
sir ken jackson , general secretary of the amicus union , said he was " disappointed " to learn of the size of lord browne 's pay increase , given that bp had recently axed 1,000 jobs at its grangemouth site in scotland .
a Â£ 6.2m package is : Â£ 119,230 a week Â£ 17,000 a day Â£ 709 an hour Â£ 11.80 a minute but sir robin nicholson , chairman of bp 's remuneration committee , said the company 's continued success depended on its ability to attract , motivate and retain world-class executive talent .
" rewards for our group chief executive and for the other executive directors must be competitive with the rewards in similar global companies , " he wrote in bp 's annual report .
sir robin said the remuneration committee sought external , independent advice on executive salaries .
" in 2001 we decided to increase the reward of our executive directors to ensure competitiveness with other global companies based both in the usa and uk . "
profits fall several other bp directors were also given pay increases last year , the annual report showed .
bp reported a sharp fall in quarterly profits last month as demand for oil and gas tumbled in the face of the economic slowdown .
average salary the average annual pay packet in england and wales is Â£ 23,338 net profit for the final three months of last year was Â£ 1.54bn , compared with Â£ 2.14bn in the previous quarter .
lord browne said last month that it was a strong result in a " mixed year " after bp met a key target of boosting its annual production rate by 5.5 % .
oil prices have been under increasing pressure in recent months , halting a strong run of profits growth for bp .
some companies have increased the price of petrol over the past few days and there have been reports of a 20p a gallon rise by easter because of fears of a war with iraq .
according to a guardian report last year , lord browne is not quite the uk 's fattest cat .
leader of the pack is martin read of logica , who earned Â£ 27.3m last year .
sir chris gent of vodafone , peter fellner of celltech and paul chisholm of colt telecom were also reported to have earned more than lord browne .

treasurer david cronin has lost his job after having failed to discover a series of unauthorised currency trades that caused the bank to suffer losses of $ 691m -lrb- Â£ 483m -rrb- .
in addition , allfirst 's chairman , frank bramble , will retire early in june , although aib stressed that he had no knowledge of the affair .
but chief executive , susan keating , will stay , aib said .
aib shares fell as the firings failed to mollify angry investors .
" -lsb- ms keating -rsb- should really have been held responsible for what happened at allfirst " , said one senior analyst , while another , piers brown of commerzbank , said aib had merely done the " absolute bare minimum " to calm investors ' qualms .
alan rubenstein , chairman of the national association of pension funds Â¿ investment committee , said he believed the chief executive should take responsibility .
" if she did know -lsb- about the trades -rsb- then she should go , " chairman of the national association of pension funds Â¿ investment committee alan rubenstein told bbc personal finance reporter andrew verity .
heads roll aib 's announcement came after the its and allfirst 's boards met on wednesday to discuss an in-house report which resulted from a 30-days long investigation into the affair by eugene ludwig , once an official in the administration of former us president bill clinton .
aib also said it would strengthen controls across the group and restructure to create a more integrated , streamlined operation .
the bank would combine the bank 's risk and finance departments , close down allfirst 's treasury operations in the us and move them to dublin , and appoint a risk management officer for allfirst .
the three other senior allfirst managers who were fired were the vice presidents jan palmer and robert ray , and the head of internal audit , michael husich .
two middle managers , lou slisker and lawrence smith , were also dismissed .
blame aib blames the alleged fraud at its allfirst on the actions of currency trader john rusnak who was reporting to mr cronin .
the bank has accused him of forging documents to hide trading losses incurred between 1997 and 2001 .
it said he did this without inside help by exploiting lax risk management procedures .
however , mr rusnak is reported to have told us investigators that he had approval from senior aib executives for at least one of his riskiest deals .
the fbi is conducting a criminal investigation into the losses at allfirst .
aib itself has also come under fire for failing to spot the unauthorised deals and impose better controls .
the scandal is the biggest to hit a european bank since nick leeson sank barings bank in the 1990s .
the losses incurred had apparently gone unnoticed for several years .
the scandal has provoked speculation that aib could become a takeover target by other european financial firms . watch / listen on this story michael buckly , chief executive , allied irish banks " at the end of the day i believe it was a people failure . "
brian o 'connell , dublin evening herald " the report reveals a catalogue of errors all throughout allfirst 's systems . "

treasurer david cronin has lost his job after having failed to discover a series of unauthorised currency trades that caused the bank to suffer losses of $ 691m -lrb- Â£ 483m -rrb- .
in addition , allfirst 's chairman , frank bramble , will retire early in june , although aib stressed that he had no knowledge of the affair .
but chief executive , susan keating , will stay , aib said .
aib shares fell as the firings failed to mollify angry investors .
" -lsb- ms keating -rsb- should really have been held responsible for what happened at allfirst " , said one senior analyst , while another , piers brown of commerzbank , said aib had merely done the " absolute bare minimum " to calm investors ' qualms .
alan rubenstein , chairman of the national association of pension funds Â¿ investment committee , said he believed the chief executive should take responsibility .
" if she did know -lsb- about the trades -rsb- then she should go , " chairman of the national association of pension funds Â¿ investment committee alan rubenstein told bbc personal finance reporter andrew verity .
heads roll aib 's announcement came after the its and allfirst 's boards met on wednesday to discuss an in-house report which resulted from a 30-days long investigation into the affair by eugene ludwig , once an official in the administration of former us president bill clinton .
aib also said it would strengthen controls across the group and restructure to create a more integrated , streamlined operation .
the bank would combine the bank 's risk and finance departments , close down allfirst 's treasury operations in the us and move them to dublin , and appoint a risk management officer for allfirst .
the three other senior allfirst managers who were fired were the vice presidents jan palmer and robert ray , and the head of internal audit , michael husich .
two middle managers , lou slisker and lawrence smith , were also dismissed .
blame aib blames the alleged fraud at its allfirst on the actions of currency trader john rusnak who was reporting to mr cronin .
the bank has accused him of forging documents to hide trading losses incurred between 1997 and 2001 .
it said he did this without inside help by exploiting lax risk management procedures .
however , mr rusnak is reported to have told us investigators that he had approval from senior aib executives for at least one of his riskiest deals .
the fbi is conducting a criminal investigation into the losses at allfirst .
aib itself has also come under fire for failing to spot the unauthorised deals and impose better controls .
the scandal is the biggest to hit a european bank since nick leeson sank barings bank in the 1990s .
the losses incurred had apparently gone unnoticed for several years .
the scandal has provoked speculation that aib could become a takeover target by other european financial firms .

the first defendant to appear was the former governor of the territory , abilio soares , who sat impassively as the prosecution read out the charges against him .
wiranto is conspicuously absent from the list he was accused of being responsible for massive human rights violations carried out by his subordinates and for failing to take proper action to stop the killing .
he is also charged with being behind the anti-independence militias which are widely believed to have been responsible for much of the violence .
east timor 's former police chief , timbul silaen , was subsequently accused of similar crimes .
at least 1,000 people died and many of the towns and villages were razed to the ground in the violence widely believed to have been orchestrated by the indonesian military and government .
soares sat impassively through the indictment the prosecution are focusing on several specific attacks both before and after the un-sponsored referendum , including massacres at two churches and at the home of dili bishop carlos ximenes belo .
after many delays and doubts whether these trials would ever go ahead , the first cases have begun .
the justice and human rights minister yusril mahendra said he was satisfied that judges and prosecutors were ready for what was a momentous day in indonesian legal history .
but one of the main defence lawyers told the bbc he believes they have a strong defence against all the charges as the accused were only carrying out duties asked of them by the government .

in total 18 government officials and members of the security forces are due to stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in east timor three years ago .
amongst them are three generals , the former provincial governor and leaders of the militia gangs , widely believed to have been responsible for much of the violence .

the prosecutors will be focusing on a number of specific attacks on independent supporters including massacres at two churches .
political will megawati : question of political will bbc jakarta correspondent richard galpin says the international community will watch these trials closely to see if justice really is done or whether the verdicts are manipulated to protect senior officers .
the key issue is whether the government of president megawati sukarnoputri has the political will to administer justice .

environmental charity encams , the organiser of the seaside awards , said its blue-and-yellow flags will be flown this summer at 317 beaches which passed strict criteria on beach management .
issues checked included cleanliness , disabled access , first aid provision , dog control , facilities , maintenance and information .
the environment agency tests bathing water quality and only those beaches that have passed the eu minimum legal standards are eligible for the award .
chief executive alan woods said british beaches were a vast improvement on a decade ago .
scarborough has won an award every year since 1992 " while there is still much to be done , the time has come for all of us to stop being embarrassed about our beaches and start celebrating them for what they are - a viable option for tourists here and from overseas .
" the tired old cliches about britain 's coastline being unattractive , its beaches dirty and its facilities antiquated , should be consigned to the past where they belong . "
this year 's record haul of flags completes a steady rise in award-winners since the scheme began in 1992 when only 92 made the grade .
the total is up nine on last year with most of the gains being made along the english riviera , with four new winners coming from torbay .
scotland , yorkshire and the south-east of england have also made gains - while the east of england , the channel islands , the north-east and the east midlands have maintained the number of flags they achieved last year .
among those beaches that won an award in 1992 , and have received them every year since , are southend , eastbourne , benone strand -lrb- northern ireland -rrb- , poole , tenby and scarborough .

mr straw said the issues where the european union can only make changes if all states agree are not " fixed in concrete " . "
too often member states have weakened the single market to protect national interests " peter hain the comments to a committee of mps have prompted the conservatives to accuse mr straw of being ready to dilute british influence by trying to " curry favour " in europe .
as this weekend 's barcelona summit on european economic reform looms , europe minister peter hain has also urged countries to champion the eu as much as their nations .
mr straw was speaking to the commons foreign affairs select committee when he was asked about whether he would be ready for fewer issues to be decided unanimously .
' no religious principle ' some critics of the current system want more qualified majority voting -lrb- qmv -rrb- , where countries ' votes are weighted but they can not individually scupper plans .
mr straw said : " am i going to say now that whatever the arguments we receive , the current position on qmv is going to be fixed in concrete ?
the answer is no . "
" we should be ready to listen to the arguments that the convention may advance .
there is not religious principle around qmv .
" the test is how the national interest is served .
" in many cases you defend the national interest by the national veto but in some cases you defend it by qmv . "
mr straw said in some areas , such as defence , the national veto had to be maintained but on other issues plans did not help britain .
foreign office officials later stressed government policy remained the same and britain would not give up the veto on issues like taxation , foreign policy and defence .
that reassurance failed to satisfy conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram .
" you do not gain influence by surrendering your right to stop something , " said mr ancram .
" you have less influence if you give up that right .
" this is yet another example of jack straw surrendering britain 's national interests and the means to protect them in the hope of currying favour with european colleagues . "
peter hain is representing the government on the convention looking at eu reform but he said talk of qmv and other institutional issues left the public cold .
but a practical agenda for real change in the eu 's approach to jobs , prosperity and social justice was on offer at the barcelona summit , he told a social market foundation seminar .
' stalled ' programme the summit will focus on how to make europe the world 's most " competitive knowledge-driven economy " .
senior labour mp donald anderson earlier suggested there was a " consensus " that the reform process had stalled and " hit the buffers of strong national vested interests " .
tony blair last year described the summit as " make or break " but now both mr straw and mr hain are being noticeably more circumspect .
the europe minister said : " barcelona is only the second summit in 10 , " said the europe minister , underlining the need to maintain momentum .
real progress had already been made , including the creation of 5m jobs , argued mr hain .
he continued : " too often member states have weakened the single market to protect national interests .
elections looming " but in a globalised economy , we need european as well as national champions . "
there are concerns the forthcoming french and german elections could mean plans for change , including moves to free up energy markets to cut electricity bills , could be blocked .
mr hain said elections were " sensitive issues " but would not " hold things up substantially " .
" remember we did not agree to a whole lot of things and asked our european colleagues for some forbearance in the run up to the last election , " he said .
but after the polls , the uk signed up to many of those decisions .
