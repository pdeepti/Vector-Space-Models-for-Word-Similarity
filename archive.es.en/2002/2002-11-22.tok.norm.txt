the ensuing disaster could be even worse than the 1989 exxon valdez catastrophe off alaska . galician authorities are bracing themselves for the worst oil slick disaster in history after the stricken tanker " prestige " floundering off the spanish northwestern coast broke up and sank .
the tanker , which has already spewed some 5,000 tons into the sea , split into two early on tuesday .
the vessel , with 77,000 tons of fuel oil on board and flying a bahamas flag of convenience , ran into trouble off the galician coast last wednesday .

the " neuwerk " is heading toward the scene of the " prestige " oil disaster off the spanish northwestern coast in the hope that its specialist pumps can help to prevent an even bigger catastrophe . a german specialist ship left its home dock of cuxhaven on friday making its way to the galician coast scene of the oil tanker disaster .
the ship , the " neuwerk , " with its crew of 20 is due to arrive off the spanish northwestern coast in about five days and will assist authorities in trying to prevent further oil slicks from the sunken tanker " prestige " from reaching the ecologically sensitive coastline .
high-powered pumps the " neuwerk " is equipped with custom-made pumps that can suck up high-sea oil slicks .
" we 're confident we can get rid of large amounts of the oil , " said leszek szymanski of germany 's task force for the prevention of pollution on high seas in cuxhaven .
with its flexible pumps , the ship can vacuum up to 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,300 -rrb- of oil from the surface .
deteriorating conditions however , their operation is largely dependent on weather conditions as the pumps can only be used in wind forces up to six on the beaufort scale and in seas no higher than 1.5 meters -lrb- five feet -rrb- .
and the forecast does not bode well .
" we 're expecting a pretty rough weather front , " said norbert kersting , the ship 's captain .

the ensuing disaster could be even worse than the 1989 exxon valdez catastrophe off alaska . galician authorities are bracing themselves for the worst oil slick disaster in history after the stricken tanker " prestige " floundering off the spanish northwestern coast broke up and sank .

the " neuwerk " is heading toward the scene of the " prestige " oil disaster off the spanish northwestern coast in the hope that its specialist pumps can help to prevent an even bigger catastrophe . a german specialist ship left its home dock of cuxhaven on friday making its way to the galician coast scene of the oil tanker disaster .
the ship , the " neuwerk , " with its crew of 20 is due to arrive off the spanish northwestern coast in about five days and will assist authorities in trying to prevent further oil slicks from the sunken tanker " prestige " from reaching the ecologically sensitive coastline .
high-powered pumps the " neuwerk " is equipped with custom-made pumps that can suck up high-sea oil slicks .
" we 're confident we can get rid of large amounts of the oil , " said leszek szymanski of germany 's task force for the prevention of pollution on high seas in cuxhaven .
with its flexible pumps , the ship can vacuum up to 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,300 -rrb- of oil from the surface .
deteriorating conditions however , their operation is largely dependent on weather conditions as the pumps can only be used in wind forces up to six on the beaufort scale and in seas no higher than 1.5 meters -lrb- five feet -rrb- .
and the forecast does not bode well .
" we 're expecting a pretty rough weather front , " said norbert kersting , the ship 's captain .

the ensuing disaster could be even worse than the 1989 exxon valdez catastrophe off alaska . galician authorities are bracing themselves for the worst oil slick disaster in history after the stricken tanker " prestige " floundering off the spanish northwestern coast broke up and sank .
the tanker , which has already spewed some 5,000 tons into the sea , split into two early on tuesday .
the vessel , with 77,000 tons of fuel oil on board and flying a bahamas flag of convenience , ran into trouble off the galician coast last wednesday .
authorities are now monitoring two large slicks moving toward the spanish coast .
difficult conditions salvage experts said that as yet no further compartments containing oil had split .
they were vague about the possibility of pumping the oil from the ship citing bad weather and the depth of around 3,600 meters where the ship sank .
they added that the ship 's tanks might crack upon hitting the sea floor or implode as a result of the water pressure .
should the oil escape , environmentalists fear a catastrophe on an even bigger scale than the 1989 exxon valdez disaster off alaska .
according to reports , the 26-year-old japanese-built tanker has not been inspected since 1999 , when the ports of rotterdam and new york both complained of security lapses .

the galician coastline is one of spain 's most beautiful regions , famous for corals , marine life and seabirds .
already several hundred seabirds have been killed by the oil .
the region is also heavily dependent on tourism and fishing with the industry employing around 120,000 people .
meanwhile , a row has erupted between portugal and spain over responsibility for the vessel and the pollution it is causing .
chief galacian regional government officer arsenio fernandez de mesa said the tanker had crossed into portugal 's salvage zone before it began breaking up .
however , portuguese authorities say the vessel was outside of portugal 's exclusive economic zone when it split up .

the ensuing disaster could be even worse than the 1989 exxon valdez catastrophe off alaska . galician authorities are bracing themselves for the worst oil slick disaster in history after the stricken tanker " prestige " floundering off the spanish northwestern coast broke up and sank .
the tanker , which has already spewed some 5,000 tons into the sea , split into two early on tuesday .

the " neuwerk " is heading toward the scene of the " prestige " oil disaster off the spanish northwestern coast in the hope that its specialist pumps can help to prevent an even bigger catastrophe . a german specialist ship left its home dock of cuxhaven on friday making its way to the galician coast scene of the oil tanker disaster .

high-powered pumps the " neuwerk " is equipped with custom-made pumps that can suck up high-sea oil slicks .
" we 're confident we can get rid of large amounts of the oil , " said leszek szymanski of germany 's task force for the prevention of pollution on high seas in cuxhaven .

and the forecast does not bode well .
" we 're expecting a pretty rough weather front , " said norbert kersting , the ship 's captain .

the " neuwerk " is heading toward the scene of the " prestige " oil disaster off the spanish northwestern coast in the hope that its specialist pumps can help to prevent an even bigger catastrophe . a german specialist ship left its home dock of cuxhaven on friday making its way to the galician coast scene of the oil tanker disaster .

high-powered pumps the " neuwerk " is equipped with custom-made pumps that can suck up high-sea oil slicks .
" we 're confident we can get rid of large amounts of the oil , " said leszek szymanski of germany 's task force for the prevention of pollution on high seas in cuxhaven .

the " neuwerk " is heading toward the scene of the " prestige " oil disaster off the spanish northwestern coast in the hope that its specialist pumps can help to prevent an even bigger catastrophe . a german specialist ship left its home dock of cuxhaven on friday making its way to the galician coast scene of the oil tanker disaster .

"
it looks as if 95 % of current dogs come from just three original founding females " matthew binns , animal health trust three research teams have attempted to solve some long-standing puzzles in the evolution and social history of dogs .
their findings , reported in the journal science , point to the existence of probably three founding females - the so-called " eves " of the dog world .
they conclude that intensive breeding by humans over the last 500 years - not different genetic origins - is responsible for the dramatic differences in appearance among modern dogs .
one team studied old world dogs to try to pin down their origins , previously thought to be in the middle east .
the other team studied dogs of the new world and found they are not new world dogs at all , but also have their origins in east asia .
bbci nature - pets click here for facts about dogs carles vila , of uppsala university , sweden , one of the team studying the new world dogs , told bbc news online : " we found that dogs originating in the old world arrived to the new world with immigrating humans .
" thus , even before the development of trade as we know it now , humans had to be exchanging dogs . "
he added that exactly how or why humans domesticated dogs was not known , but the speed at which they seem to have multiplied and diversified indicates they played an important role in human life .
" i can imagine that if dogs were , for example , improving the quality of hunting , that would be a very great advantage for humans .
it could even have made the colonisation of the new world easier .
" there must have been something advantageous about those dogs that made them extremely successful and allowed them to spread all over the world . "
peter savolainen , of the royal institute of technology , stockholm , led the study of old world dogs , analysing dna samples taken from dogs in asia , europe , africa and arctic america .
' bit of a surprise ' his team found that , though most dogs shared a common gene pool , genetic diversity was highest in east asia , suggesting that dogs have been domesticated there the longest .
" most earlier guesses have focused on the middle east as the place of origin for dogs , based on the few known facts - a small amount of archaeological evidence from the region , and the fact that several other animals were domesticated there , " he says .
the researchers studied gene sequences from the dogs ' mitochondrial dna , which is inherited directly from the mother .
the findings indicated that the major present-day dog populations at some point had a common origin from a single gene pool .
matthew binns , head of genetics at the animal health trust in newmarket , uk , said the findings were significant .
he told bbc news online : " for the first time , there 's relatively convincing evidence actually pinpointing the date at which the dog was domesticated and also the location of that domestication , which is a bit of a surprise .
" people have previously thought that a lot of species were domesticated in the middle east and this data clearly shows domestication took place in east asia . "
he added : " it looks as if 95 % of current dogs come from just three original founding females and i guess these are the eves of the dog world . "
human evolution in a separate study , researchers at harvard university and the wolf hollow wolf sanctuary , both us , studied social cognition in dogs and were surprised by the findings .
in a simple experiment designed to compare their behaviour to those of wolves and our closest relative , the chimpanzee , the findings clearly showed that dogs - even young puppies - were far better at interpreting social cues from humans .
the dogs had to choose which bucket had food hidden underneath it , and the experiment was designed so they could not rely on their superb sense of smell .
the scientists helped by pointing or looking in the direction of the hidden food .
researcher brian hare said the dogs outperformed even the chimpanzees , and the puppies were as good as the older dogs , proving the skill was innate and not learned .
" during domestication there was some kind of change in their cognitive ability that allowed them to figure out what other individuals wanted using social cues .
the biggest surprise was the puppies - even as young as nine weeks old , they 're better than an adult chimpanzee at finding food . "
he said the research might ultimately provide some clues as to how social skills evolved in humans .

critics say mr koizumi needs to do more the cabinet has approved the government 's plan to spend an extra 3 trillion yen -lrb- £ 15.5bn ; $ 24bn -rrb- to help lift japan out of its economic crisis which has seen its stock market fall to a 19-year low .
the spending plan was quickly denounced by analysts as insufficient " recovery simply is n't possible with just public works , " said bnp paribas chief economist koji shimamoto .
" the supplementary budget remains a job half done , " agreed japan 's leading business newspaper , the nihon keizai shimbun " the government and the central bank need to follow with additional efforts . "
more is needed japan is in desperate difficulty .
" the move toward recovery has slowed , and the situation surrounding prospects for the economy is growing more uncertain , " prime minister junichiro koizumi said .
an extra 1.5 trillion yen spent on public works and a further 1.5 trillion yen spent to create jobs and help small firms should help japan recover , the government hopes .
but reversing the shrinkage of japan 's economy and its falling prices would require much greater efforts , said mr shimamoto .
" even if the number had an extra zero at the end and was 10 times the amount , getting out of deflation isn ¿ t possible , " he said .
" the supplementary budget is still very small , " agreed hsbc senior economist peter morgan .
" it is no stimulus at all . "
japan 's economy has been in slowdown since the early 1990s .
its banking sector is burdened by a mountain of bad debts which put a squeeze on credit for investment in the private sector .
the government is itself massively indebted too .
economists agree that radical reform is needed , but there is much resistance against change from powerful pressure groups and their allies in the government .
strong shares japanese shares rose , lifting the nikkei index of leading shares 1.21 % to 8,772.56 , its highest close in two weeks .
the stock market has risen 7 % after hitting a 19-year-low last month , but observers said this had as much to do with strong stock markets and economic recovery hopes in the us as with japan 's economic prospects .
red screens , indicating falling share prices , have become a familiar sight for japanese stock market traders in recent months and few believe the market is set for a sustained recovery .

new challenges seven former members of nato 's cold war adversary , the defunct warsaw pact , were formally invited on thursday to join nato as the alliance prepares for a totally different role .
germany 's frankfurter rundschau argues that such is the scale of the changes to which nato has committed itself in prague , that it should warrant endorsement through the ballot box .
" political honesty , " it says , " would require a debate on how ... we propose to face the new challenges ... to be put to the people , " it says .
the paper questions whether an alliance originally created for territorial defence can now be steered in a completely different direction without seeking popular approval .
instead , it believes , a new alliance treaty should be negotiated , although it would be a difficult process and might result the departure of some of the present members .
" it is a bad sign that nato is avoiding such a fundamental debate precisely for that reason , " the paper concludes .
lingering doubts the czech lidove noviny says that " the alliance is reaching out " .
until now , it notes , nato was " wedged in the euro-atlantic space " but yesterday in prague " it took a step into the world outside " by announcing a new response force which will " intervene wherever needed " .
as a result , it warns , the czechs " will have to become accustomed to increasingly frequent deployments of their soldiers in dangerous missions around the world " .
czechs must get used to increasingly frequent deployments in dangerous missions lidove noviny from the political standpoint , the paper sees nato membership as the strongest guarantee that the newcomers from the former communist bloc will keep to the straight and narrow .
despite lingering doubts over " corruption , old structures and tragic social conditions " , it says , nato 's " massive pressure " should become " the main engine of their transformation " .
american burden a commentary in poland 's rzeczpospolita notes that thanks to the new arrivals , poland " is gaining allied neighbours at sensitive points on its borders " .
but the paper is unhappy at what it sees as the huge disproportion between the partners on the alliance 's two atlantic shores .
expanding nato responsibility to new areas , it argues , " ought not to mean burdening america with the entire responsibility for the security of bulgaria or estonia " .
in creating the american-proposed nato response force , the paper suggests , " europe should take up specific duties , not just political and discursive ones , in the protection of peace and security " .
nato 's expansion , it adds , will only be significant if " accompanied by the will and possibility for joint defence of the values declared in the atlantic charter ... on the territories of former and new members " .
world gendarme ?
the view from moscow is - understandably perhaps - somewhat more sceptical .
the government daily rossiyskaya gazeta claims there are divisions between europe and washington , arguing that " not all of the american remedies to preserve nato 's viability are to the europeans ' liking " .
not all us remedies to preserve nato 's viability are to europeans ' liking rossiyskaya gazeta " the idea of turning the alliance into a world gendarme ... to allow the americans to attain global supremacy , " the paper says , " is opposed not just by paris and berlin , nato 's main european ' players ' , but also , with certain provisos , by london . "

new challenges seven former members of nato 's cold war adversary , the defunct warsaw pact , were formally invited on thursday to join nato as the alliance prepares for a totally different role .
germany 's frankfurter rundschau argues that such is the scale of the changes to which nato has committed itself in prague , that it should warrant endorsement through the ballot box .
" political honesty , " it says , " would require a debate on how ... we propose to face the new challenges ... to be put to the people , " it says .
the paper questions whether an alliance originally created for territorial defence can now be steered in a completely different direction without seeking popular approval .
instead , it believes , a new alliance treaty should be negotiated , although it would be a difficult process and might result the departure of some of the present members .
" it is a bad sign that nato is avoiding such a fundamental debate precisely for that reason , " the paper concludes .
lingering doubts the czech lidove noviny says that " the alliance is reaching out " .
until now , it notes , nato was " wedged in the euro-atlantic space " but yesterday in prague " it took a step into the world outside " by announcing a new response force which will " intervene wherever needed " .
as a result , it warns , the czechs " will have to become accustomed to increasingly frequent deployments of their soldiers in dangerous missions around the world " . "
czechs must get used to increasingly frequent deployments in dangerous missions " lidove noviny from the political standpoint , the paper sees nato membership as the strongest guarantee that the newcomers from the former communist bloc will keep to the straight and narrow .
despite lingering doubts over " corruption , old structures and tragic social conditions " , it says , nato 's " massive pressure " should become " the main engine of their transformation " .
american burden a commentary in poland 's rzeczpospolita notes that thanks to the new arrivals , poland " is gaining allied neighbours at sensitive points on its borders " .
but the paper is unhappy at what it sees as the huge disproportion between the partners on the alliance 's two atlantic shores .
expanding nato responsibility to new areas , it argues , " ought not to mean burdening america with the entire responsibility for the security of bulgaria or estonia " .
in creating the american-proposed nato response force , the paper suggests , " europe should take up specific duties , not just political and discursive ones , in the protection of peace and security " .
nato 's expansion , it adds , will only be significant if " accompanied by the will and possibility for joint defence of the values declared in the atlantic charter ... on the territories of former and new members " .
world gendarme ?
the view from moscow is - understandably perhaps - somewhat more sceptical .
the government daily rossiyskaya gazeta claims there are divisions between europe and washington , arguing that " not all of the american remedies to preserve nato 's viability are to the europeans ' liking " . "
not all us remedies to preserve nato 's viability are to europeans ' liking " rossiyskaya gazeta " the idea of turning the alliance into a world gendarme ... to allow the americans to attain global supremacy , " the paper says , " is opposed not just by paris and berlin , nato 's main european ' players ' , but also , with certain provisos , by london . "
the handshake " friends again ? " asks the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung of thursday 's handshake between president george w bush and chancellor gerhard schroeder at the nato summit in prague .
" few handshakes have received greater scrutiny , " the paper says , at least by " those germans worried about the freeze that descended upon bilateral relations " since the chancellor 's august campaign-trail vow not to involve german forces in any attack on iraq .

the european commission is poised to reveal that the uk government did not break eu rules by offering the bail-out , the financial times newspaper said .
the government may even be allowed to lend more than the £ 650m granted to far , the newspaper added .
but the commission is to impose tough conditions on the rescue package .
the report comes as environmental group greenpeace , which is strongly anti-nuclear power , launches its own legal battle against the cash injection .
price drop british energy operates eight plants in the uk , and produces more than a fifth of the of the uk 's power .
it was hit hard by a steep drop in electricity prices since the wholesale power market was reformed last year .
when the extent of the crisis at british energy became apparent in september , the uk government granted the company an emergency loan facility of £ 410m .
this was then increased to £ 650m , with the loan due for repayment on 29 november .
strings attached however , observers raised questions over whether the loan broke eu regulations on government support for companies .
and the commission earlier this month said that the uk had technically broken eu law by failing to inform brussels ahead of the loan being made .
but the commission may approve the bail-out early next week , with conditions designed to ensure the cash is used only to stave off bankruptcy and not gain competitive advantage , the ft said .
the cash will have to be repaid within a year , giving british energy a limited window of opportunity for implementing a restructuring which is likely to include disposals and a debt for equity swap , a process used in the rebuilding of firms such as ntl .
' unlawful ' loan greenpeace , seeking a judicial review of the aid package , said its action was set for a court hearing on friday .
" we believe the loan is unlawful , " greenpeace campaigner rick le coyte said .
" the european commission has registered it as unlawful , the government 's own guidance suggests it is unlawful , and we hope the uk court declares it so . "
but the government loan has upset competitors and environmental groups .
the environmental lobby greenpeace is attempting to have the aid blocked in the high court .
the struggling nuclear power firm british energy has said it is thinking of selling all or part of its canadian subsidiary , bruce power .
it said it would use the money raised to repay a £ 650m loan from the uk government .
british energy got the emergency loan in september after it warned it was facing insolvency .
but the assistance has proved controversial , with opponents arguing that it goes against european regulations .
canadian interest british energy holds an 82 % stake in bruce power which analysts say could be worth between £ 600m and £ 800m .
it is thought that canadian uranium producer cameco , which is british energy 's partner in bruce power , is interested in buying the holding .
" british energy confirms that it is in discussions which may , or may not , result in the sale of all or part of its stake in bruce power , " british energy said in a statement on friday .
" if there were to be a sale , the proceeds would first be applied to repay funding from the uk government under its credit facility . "

the firm said it made a pre-tax profit of £ 300,000 for the july to september quarter .
while the firm has earlier reported profits as appraised by less stringent tests , this is the first time it has broken into the black on the most widely accepted measure .
however , the headline pre-tax figure nonetheless excluded one-off costs such as a £ 3m charge for a " fundamental reorganisation " .
including the charges , the firm made a loss of £ 9.55m during the quarter .
takeover benefits the firm said its performance had been boosted by a takeover spree which saw it acquire three companies - including the already profitable destination group - in four months .
the takeovers , which have fuelled the firm 's drive into 12 countries , have allowed the firm to introduce significant synergy costs .
besides travelprice.com , bought in april , the firm has scrapped existing computer systems at takeover targets to be replaced by the lastminute.com network .
" the sites now run on a single system , enabling us to further reduce technology spend and achieve greater return on investment , " chief executive brent hoberman and managing director martha lane fox said in a joint statement .
the growing size of the firm , which claimed 6.4 million subscribers to its newsletter and 14,500 suppliers , meant it " now benefits from economies of scale " , the duo added .

the firm said it made a pre-tax profit of £ 300,000 for the july to september quarter .
while the firm has earlier reported profits as appraised by less stringent tests , this is the first time it has broken into the black on the most widely accepted measure .
however , the headline pre-tax figure nonetheless excluded one-off costs such as a £ 3m charge for a " fundamental reorganisation " .
including the charges , the firm made a loss of £ 9.55m during the quarter .
takeover benefits the firm said its performance had been boosted by a takeover spree which saw it acquire three companies - including the already profitable destination group - in four months .
the takeovers , which have fuelled the firm 's drive into 12 countries , have allowed the firm to introduce significant synergy costs .
besides travelprice.com , bought in april , the firm has scrapped existing computer systems at takeover targets to be replaced by the lastminute.com network .
" the sites now run on a single system , enabling us to further reduce technology spend and achieve greater return on investment , " chief executive brent hoberman and managing director martha lane fox said in a joint statement .
the growing size of the firm , which claimed 6.4 million subscribers to its newsletter and 14,500 suppliers , meant it " now benefits from economies of scale " , the duo added .

for the second time this week , officers either phoned in sick or turned up for work and left shortly afterwards .
the head of the prison service , peter russell , said more than 90 % of prison officers were involved in friday 's action .
the service said all visits were being cancelled for the day .
the protest is part of an ongoing row over security measures at officers ' homes in the wake of the discovery of staff details during a police investigation into an alleged ira spy ring .
inmates at a wing of magaberry jail near lisburn refused to co-operate with prison procedures by going into their cells .
the prison service said that because of the industrial action by officers , the gates at the jail were temporarily sealed .
the prison officers ' association said some of its members were prevented from leaving the jail for a time .
guarding prisons on wednesday , 600 officers failed turn up or else left the jails by reporting sick after just a couple of hours .
police spent the night guarding maghaberry prison in county antrim and the jail at magilligan in county londonderry .
on wednesday night , prison officers ' association chairman finlay spratt said the protest would go on .
poa members are angry at what they said was the government 's failure to provide them with adequate funds to upgrade home security .
this followed the discovery of 1,400 officers ' names on a list recovered during an investigation into alleged ira intelligence gathering .
peter russell : " all officers are not assessed as being under the same threat " the director general of the prison service said nothing would be achieved by the unofficial protest action by 85 % of northern ireland 's prison officers .
peter russell said there was no doubt that the 600 prison officers who either reported they were sick or came to work on wednesday and then went home sick , were engaging in pre-planned , co-ordinated action .
it is illegal for the officers to go on strike .
two hundred police officers were called in to work in northern ireland 's two prisons , maghaberry and magilligan in londonderry , and at the young offenders ' centre in belfast .
but along with 100 prison officers who did not take part in the action , they were not able to carry out all of the duties normally undertaken .
prisoners were not brought to court and families and solicitors were not permitted to visit prisoners . watch / listen on this story bbc ni 's tara mills : " prison officers say they are still not satisfied with the personal protection schemes on offer " finlay spratt of the prison officers association : " the public have got to understand our predictament " see also : 21 nov 02 -pipe- n ireland prison protest set to continue 20 nov 02 -pipe- n ireland prisons hit by officers ' protest 12 nov 02 -pipe- n ireland ni prison officers ' may strike ' 11 nov 02 -pipe- n ireland officers protest over security help 01 nov 02 -pipe- n ireland protest warning over ' ira list ' 10 oct 02 -pipe- n ireland prison officers ' fear over ira list top n ireland stories now : nail bombs thrown at station omagh detectives make arrest orde defends inquiry comments warders still concerned at breach sdlp member ' being forced out ' jobs threat at council family claim attack was ' sectarian ' adair fails in prison challenge links to more n ireland stories are at the foot of the page .

in the second article , shadow work and pensions secretary david willetts outlined how the conservative party would solve the pensions crisis .
it is now widely agreed that there is a crisis in pensions .
the government has instead made a difficult situation worse david willetts although labour have made many mistakes , the crisis is not entirely their fault .
the closure of final salary schemes to new members is partly a response to changes in the labour market , for example .
improvements in longevity are another factor .
but this makes it all the more important that governments get right the things they do control .
sadly , the government has instead made a difficult situation worse .
the notorious stealth tax on pension funds in 1997 has taken £ 5bn a year out of our pension funds .
that adds up to around £ 25 billion already .
it has had a disastrous effect on the finances of our pension schemes .
encourage people to save the pensions crisis will mean that millions of british people who are currently working will receive an income in retirement far lower than they hope or expect .
at the moment incentives are not improving ; they are deteriorating david willetts the real challenge is how best to help people avoid a massive fall in their income the moment they retire .
the best way to respond to the challenge is to encourage people to save more .
that means better incentives to save .
but at the moment incentives are not improving ; they are deteriorating .
our pension funds are taxed in a way they never were before and there are worrying reports about yet further reductions in the tax incentives for people to save .
means-testing disincentive at the same time the spread of means-tested benefits means that people who save may be no better off as a result of doing so .
so savers are caught in a double-bind with the prospect of higher taxes on their savings and more penalties through the loss of means-tested benefits as well .
the real problem in great britain is that retirement age has been getting earlier and earlier we have suggested a reform of benefits for pensioners .
instead of the extension of means-testing through the pension credit , we proposed that money should instead have been put into a higher rate of pension for older pensioners .
older pensioners tend to be poorer - on average pensioner couples aged over 75 have an income £ 80 a week less than couples just over state pension age - so this would be well targeted on poverty without more means-testing .
we have also come up with an imaginative lifetime savings account into which people can put money in the good times and which attracts a government contribution in an escrow account .
they can withdraw the money on a rainy day , but will only get the benefit of the government 's contribution if they put the money back before they reach pension age .
if we do n't save more , then the second option is for people to work for longer we are consulting with the financial services industry on the idea .
we envision it as a framework within which the financial services industry is able to offer a range of products that will offer a boost to savings .
if we do n't save more , then the second option is for people to work for longer .
but there is an important difference between pension age and retirement age .
the government controls the pension age but it does n't control retirement age .
and the real problem in great britain is that retirement age has been getting earlier and earlier .
one of the factors behind this has been the design of final salary pension schemes and the obvious temptations for employers to make older workers redundant and put them as a charge on the pension fund .
waste of talent it is worrying that such an unusually high proportion of the over-50 's who have lost their jobs have also been members of final salary pension schemes .
members of occupational pension schemes on above-average earnings are up to 50 % more likely to leave their jobs in their 50s than people with the same earnings who are not in a pension scheme .
we need to do far more to ensure that the enormous talents and experiences of the over-50 's are not wasted as they are today so we do need to encourage everyone to take a far more positive attitude to the contribution that over 50 's can make to the workforce .
we need to do far more to ensure that the enormous talents and experiences of the over-50 's are not wasted as they are today .
we are absolutely committed to the need to tackle this pension crisis .
it is a long-term crisis affecting people way into the future and it needs long-term solutions .
we have introduced constructive solutions and we will continue to make the pensions crisis a top priority .

the move appeared to be a reprisal for a united states-led decision to stop providing the unpredictable north with fuel oil , amid mounting tension over the country 's nuclear weapons ambitions . "
it is high time to decide upon who is to blame for the collapse of the framework " north korean foreign ministry statement it came as america 's cia warned that north korea has the capacity to produce " several more " nuclear weapons , apart from the one or two it is already believed to possess .
diplomats in japan said north korea 's decision to bar the inspectors had been conveyed in a letter to the international consortium supplying the oil , the korean peninsula energy organisation -lrb- kedo -rrb- .
kedo has provided north korea with fuel oil in exchange for the freezing of its nuclear programme since 1994 , under a deal known as the agreed framework .
fears of crisis shipments were halted last week after pyongyang allegedly admitted to have a nuclear weapons programme , thereby violating the accord and the nuclear proliferation treaty .
kedo had planned to send officials next week to pyongyang for a routine inspection to make sure that a november shipment that had already arrived by tanker from singapore was being used to generate electricity .
if the north does refuse entry to the monitors , it would call the accord 's future into serious doubt and raise the spectre of another nuclear crisis on the korean peninsular .
the north has already accused the us of collapsing the accord , though it is not clear how far its angry words were rhetoric .
the north korean foreign ministry said in a statement on thursday that pyongyang regarded the suspension of oil deliveries as " a wanton violation " of the accord .
" now that the us unilaterally gave up its last commitment under the framework , the dprk -lrb- north korea -rrb- acknowledges that it is high time to decide upon who is to blame for the collapse of the framework , " a north korean spokesman was quoted as saying by the state-run news agency kcna .
north korea had been receiving 500,000 tons of heavy oil a year from kedo .
cia warning the us says north korea admitted to us special envoy james kelly in october that it had a programme for producing highly enriched uranium - a key ingredient in nuclear weapons .
north korea has never publicly confirmed or denied having nuclear weapons .
but america 's cia said on thursday that north korea had the capacity to make more nuclear weapons than the one or two it is already believed to possess .
the cia said spent fuel from a nuclear reactor shut down under the 1994 accord could be used to make between one and six more bombs .
the enriched uranium programme which the north allegedly admitted to in october could provide " two or more " bombs each year by " mid decade " , the report said .
