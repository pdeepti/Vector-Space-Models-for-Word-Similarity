cancer research uk scientists in birmingham say they now have a better understanding of how different drugs can be used to destroy cancer cells .
the scientists have discovered that different drugs kill cancer cells in different ways .
in the future , it might be possible to directly treat cancer cells with death molecules , effectively using them as anti-cancer drugs professor lawrence young they believe using complementary drugs which target cancer cells in different ways could help to stop tumours becoming resistant to treatment .
anti-cancer drugs work by flicking a " suicide switch " within each cancer cell .
resistance to the drugs develops when one such switch becomes jammed .
the team focused on ovarian cancer , which often responds to chemotherapy initially before developing resistance to it at a later stage .
the scientists removed cells from ovarian tumours , grew them in the laboratory and treated them with a range of anti-cancer drugs .
their findings should improve their understanding of cell death mechanisms .
knowing the exact mechanism could lead to a more effective use of combinations of chemotherapy treatments and could be tailored for each cancer in each patient .
double benefit scientists also hope that choosing drugs to target several different switches all at once could prevent a tumour from developing resistance to treatment .
team leader professor lawrence young said : " our research has allowed us to find out which switches are targeted by different drugs , so that we can learn to mix and match far more effectively than is currently possible . "
professor young and his colleagues also believe that further research into how drugs cause cancer cells to commit suicide could pave the way for new types of treatment .
they found treating drug-resistant cancer cells with cell death molecules seemed to re-activate suicide switches that had become jammed , restoring sensitivity to chemotherapy .
combined drugs could prevent resistance one cell death molecule which triggers a number of suicide switches is cd95l .
researchers inserted this into a virus , which they then used to infect drug-resistant cancer cells .
the cell death molecule short-circuited the cells ' jammed suicide switches , knocking them into suicide mode even though some of the switches had not been flicked .
professor young said : " in the future , it might be possible to directly treat cancer cells with these death molecules , effectively using them as anti-cancer drugs . "
professor gordon mcvie , joint director of cancer research uk , said : " professor young 's research could have a double benefit for cancer patients .
" it should allow doctors to make much better use of existing drugs , by using them in the combinations in which they 'll be most effective .
" and it may also lead to a new breed of drugs that work differently from conventional chemotherapy .
