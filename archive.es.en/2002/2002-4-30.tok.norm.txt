the communist state also agreed to allow japanese wives of north koreans to visit japan .
in return , japan is to search for koreans taken to japan before 1945 .
the agreements come after two days of talks at a hotel in the chinese capital - the first in two years between the two countries ' red cross officials .
such meetings , observers say , are a means of diplomacy used by tokyo and pyongyang .
a new round of talks , at an undisclosed location , was agreed for june .
tokyo says north korea abducted 11 japanese nationals 25 years ago to train them as spies or to teach north korean agents the japanese language and customs .
north korea , for its part , says that 259 north koreans went missing in japan before and during world war ii .
japan colonised the korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 , forcing hundreds of thousands of koreans into slave labour and prostitution .
tuesday 's agreement also means that about 1,800 japanese women married to north koreans can now visit their home country .
they moved to north korea with their ethnic korean husbands between 1959 and 1982 .
history of antagonism the dispute over the missing japanese and the wives has stood in the way of normalising relations between the two countries for years .
last december , north korea broke off contacts on the issue after a japanese coast guard fired on a suspected north korean spy boat that entered japanese waters .
japanese divers are preparing to start surveys this week of the ship that sank in the east china sea in december , reuters news agency has reported .
all 15 crew members are believed to have died in the incident .
japanese intelligence sources have said they suspect the ship was on a spying or drug-smuggling mission , but north korea says that is part of a smear campaign .

gm has taken a 42.1 % stake in a joint venture with daewoo 's creditors , who will hold 33 % with the other 24.9 % going to gm partners .
gm is investing $ 400m and the creditors $ 197m , while the new joint venture will assume $ 573m in debt .
another $ 2bn in long-term credit will come from the creditors , led by the korean development bank -lrb- kdb -rrb- .
the signing was not without incident .
unionised workers are still unhappy about the likely effects of the deal and 50-60 workers occupied the seoul hotel where the signing was meant to take place , forcing a change of venue to the kdb headquarters .
first steps the deal marks the first completed restructuring in the wake of the collapse of several of korea 's manufacturing monoliths following the asian currency crisis of 1997 .
the massive debts hanging round the necks of the chaebols , as the huge conglomerates are known , meant insolvency for some - including the daewoo group , whose debts topped $ 80bn .
daewoo motor 's share of that was about $ 17.5bn.
now , though , the deal could open the door for further foreign investment .
dr. paul niewenhuis from cardiff business school told the bbc 's world business report the deal should give the korean economy a boost .
" it certainly shows foreign confidence in korea for the longer term , " he said .
pick and choose the deal means gm gains access to one of the fastest-growing car markets in the world , and one in which most customers still prefer domestic brands .
over 1.4 million cars were sold in south korea last year , of which 170,000 were from daewoo - a market share of about 12 % , down from 20 % three years ago .
gm sold less than 300 .
it is taking on only two of daewoo 's four korean plants , together with one in hanoi , vietnam , and nine sales subsidiaries in western europe and puerto rico .
of the two remaining korean factories , one - with the most union militancy - will be run by creditors under a six-year agreement to feed the joint venture 's plants with parts and supplies .
the other , and the remaining 15 elsewhere in the world , will either have to be sold separately , closed or added to the supply deals .
daewoo 's plant in egypt - originally seen as part and parcel of the deal - has been excluded , along with a dozen factories in poland , uzbekistan and elsewhere .
resuscitation as for daewoo , the deal at least ensures continuity .
once the flagship arm of the mighty daewoo group , the company has had to rely on the generosity of creditors since the parent collapsed in 1998 .
the long-drawn-out negotiations have almost broken down a number of times , not least because daewoo 's unionised workforce has been deeply unhappy about the likely layoffs .
they also disapproved of the way gm has been able to pick and choose the plants it wants .
gm has been seen as holding a strong negotiating position ever since ford pulled out of the bidding in september 2000 .
