look at the election posters now littering the streets for the thousands of candidates standing in sunday 's general elections - and there is hardly a black face to be seen .
brazil has always prided itself on being a racial democracy - but more and more brazilians are becoming aware that may be a myth .
the statistics tell the story : black or mixed brazilians represent 45 % of the population .
but nearly two-thirds of black brazilians live below the poverty line .
they are more likely to be unemployed and they earn less .
as one goes up in the education system there are fewer and fewer black faces .
one of the few exceptions in the university of sao paulo communications school is rosangela malachias , a doctoral student who is also a beneficiary of one of the few affirmative action programmes in brazil . "
brazilian society and the federal government do not like to discuss racism " rosangela malachias , doctoral student she gets a small government grant to help prepare for exams to become a diplomat .
" imagine i have never had a black professor - how is that possible in brazil ? " she said .
" in my opinion this is racism .
but brazilian society and the federal government do not like to discuss racism . "
ms malachias says there are three other black doctoral students in her school - but two are from africa .
" where are the black brazilians ? " she asks indignantly .
growing movement she says , however , that a growing black movement is now forcing politicians to take some notice .
and indeed politicians have been trying to woo the black vote .
but the inequalities of the rest of society are mirrored in the political system .
those campaigning for greater representation complain that only 2 % of the present members of congress are black and no top members of government are black .
at his close-of-campaign rally , workers ' party candidate luiz inacio lula da silva - who is way ahead in the polls - introduced the african-american activist jesse jackson to the crowd .
lula is promising to provide more jobs and education aimed at black brazilians .
the government-backed candidate jose serra is also promising to expand the existing government 's small affirmative action programme .
voices of protest in the slums and shanty towns surrounding sao paulo and other big cities , voices of protest are starting to be heard .
the libertarios are a rap group , performing in the southern slums of sao paulo , whose music highlights the inequalities .
they have also set up a small community centre with a library and other facilities . "
the community is very divided " joselito almeida , rap artist they say one of the problems is that many brazilians with both african and european forebears consider themselves to be white .
and the conditions of the slums generate divisions and apathy which make it hard to organise people to push for change .
" many people , because they are unemployed , have become drug addicts , " said the group 's joselito almeida .
" the community is very divided .
a lot of our generation went into drug gangs .
" many of those that we grew up with were killed before they got to 20 . "
one of the libertarios ' songs describes the lack of opportunities for those growing up in the slums , the stereotyping of slum residents as ignorant , uneducated or criminal and asks whether slavery has really ended .
given the potential size of the black vote in brazil , it is surprising that the issue of race has not been more prominent in the elections .
it is a country only starting to recognise that it may have a problem with race equality .

he took the action in response to a new us law which called for the city to be regarded as israel 's capital , sparking anger among palestinians .
the fresh tension over jerusalem comes as the foreign policy chief of the european union , javier solana , arrives in israel for talks .
sporadic violence has also continued in west bank towns , with a fifth palestinian child being killed in confrontations with israeli troops in two weeks .
embassy change demanded us president george w bush signed the new provision on jerusalem as part of a much broader bill allocating the budget to the state department .
he insisted that us policy towards the status of jerusalem - claimed by both israel and the palestinians had not changed .
the us says the status of jerusalem has to be decided as part of a permanent solution between the palestinians and israel .
but the law , in which the us congress demanded that the us embassy be moved from tel aviv and for jerusalem to be listed as the israeli capital in all official documents , provoked protests among palestinians .
mr arafat called its signing a " catastrophe " , and palestinians and arabs saw it as a biased move backing israel 's claims to the city which they want as the capital of a future state and as the centre of palestinian legislative , judicial and executive authorities .
the new palestinian law on jerusalem is itself almost wholly symbolic , correspondents say , as israel retains full control of the city it annexed in 1967 .
on saturday , a 15-year-old died as youths defied military curfews in the town of nablus and hurled stones at israeli army jeeps and tanks .
the soldiers inside then opened fire on them .
four other palestinians aged between 10 to 15 have been killed by israeli gunfire in and around nablus in the last two weeks , during which time an israeli soldier and two palestinian adults have also died .
talks planned mr solana is scheduled to hold talks on sunday with israel 's defence minister binyamin ben-eliezer and foreign minister shimon peres , and on monday with mr arafat .
he will be pushing the " road map for peace " developed earlier this year by the so-called quartet , comprising leaders from the eu , united nations , us and russia .
mr bush meanwhile will meet israeli prime minister ariel sharon later this month , an administration official announced .
israeli radio said mr bush , israel 's staunch ally , had invited mr sharon for what will be his seventh visit since assuming leadership of israel in march last year to discuss possible conflict in iraq .
