11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 06.09.2002 radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-terrorism officials warn of new attacks - possibly on german soil the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .
but much work remains and the country ’ s top terrorism officials warn more attacks might be in store . september 11 could become an opportunity for radical islamic groups to launch new attacks on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in history , germany ’ s top anti-terrorism officials said this week . in an interview with reuters , manfred klink , who headed the german investigation into the sept .
11 plot , said that germany ’ s anti-terrorism investigators had concluded attacks were currently in the planning stage . " we believe that both al qaeda and non-aligned groups are involved in planning such attacks , although we have no firm evidence of anything specific planned for september 11 , " klink told reuters this week . " i do n't know if al qaeda attaches much importance to anniversaries but we will be on alert on this day as others on the same wavelength as al qaeda , without necessarily being members , may find september 11 a good opportunity to strike . " shaken by the realization that the sept .
11 attacks may have been planned in hamburg , germany ’ s government has initiated a vigorous anti-terror campaign .
in two “ security packages ” passed by the german parliament , law enforcement saw increases in their budgets and personnel . the government also passed a law banning religious organizations that push extremist views , such as the cologne-based caliph state .
the caliph state ’ s leader metin kaplan is currently serving a prison term for calling for the death of a competitor and might be deported to turkey to face trial there . 70 investigations , only 1 indictment over the past year , german investigators have launched 70 investigations into islamic terrorist activity within the country , 50 of those ordered by germany ’ s federal prosecutor , according to ulrich kersten , the head of germany ’ s federal crime office , the bundeskriminalamt , -lrb- bka -rrb- who spoke with dw-radio . though the investigations have resulted in only one indictment , that last week of hamburg student and suspected mohammed atta accomplice mounir el motassadeq , they have shed new light into a murky area , he said . “ we have … a significantly better view into the islamic fundamentalist terrorist network , ” he said in the interview . kersten said that the federal crime agency suspected that islamic fundamentalists were active even before the attacks .
the arrest of a suspected osama bin laden finance chief in munich in 1998 and the break-up of a frankfurt cell planning attacks on the strasbourg christmas market in 2000 , made those suspicions more clear . “ what we didn ’ t anticipate are attacks of this proportion , ” kersten said . tightening cooperation on all levels since then , the improvement between law enforcement on the national , state and local level has improved significantly , kersten said .
cooperation with fellow european and american investigators is getting better as well . “ i don ’ t want to say that we ’ ve already reached the optimum level in cooperation , ” he said .
“ but if i look back two or three years , at the international cooperation back then as compared to right now , i think we ’ ve made a major step forward and i don ’ t see any other alternative . ”
still , any expectations that terrorist activity in germany has been stopped once and for all are misleading . as evidence , investigators point to the april attack on a synagogue in tunisia that killed 21 , including 14 german tourists .
“ we have to figure that at any moment , american , israeli , jewish and maybe also british institutions anywhere in the world could be attacked , " said kersten .

but much work remains and the country ’ s top terrorism officials warn more attacks might be in store . september 11 could become an opportunity for radical islamic groups to launch new attacks on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in history , germany ’ s top anti-terrorism officials said this week . in an interview with reuters , manfred klink , who headed the german investigation into the sept .
11 plot , said that germany ’ s anti-terrorism investigators had concluded attacks were currently in the planning stage . " we believe that both al qaeda and non-aligned groups are involved in planning such attacks , although we have no firm evidence of anything specific planned for september 11 , " klink told reuters this week . " i do n't know if al qaeda attaches much importance to anniversaries but we will be on alert on this day as others on the same wavelength as al qaeda , without necessarily being members , may find september 11 a good opportunity to strike . " shaken by the realization that the sept .
11 attacks may have been planned in hamburg , germany ’ s government has initiated a vigorous anti-terror campaign .
in two “ security packages ” passed by the german parliament , law enforcement saw increases in their budgets and personnel . the government also passed a law banning religious organizations that push extremist views , such as the cologne-based caliph state .
the caliph state ’ s leader metin kaplan is currently serving a prison term for calling for the death of a competitor and might be deported to turkey to face trial there . 70 investigations , only 1 indictment over the past year , german investigators have launched 70 investigations into islamic terrorist activity within the country , 50 of those ordered by germany ’ s federal prosecutor , according to ulrich kersten , the head of germany ’ s federal crime office , the bundeskriminalamt , -lrb- bka -rrb- who spoke with dw-radio . though the investigations have resulted in only one indictment , that last week of hamburg student and suspected mohammed atta accomplice mounir el motassadeq , they have shed new light into a murky area , he said . “ we have … a significantly better view into the islamic fundamentalist terrorist network , ” he said in the interview . kersten said that the federal crime agency suspected that islamic fundamentalists were active even before the attacks .
the arrest of a suspected osama bin laden finance chief in munich in 1998 and the break-up of a frankfurt cell planning attacks on the strasbourg christmas market in 2000 , made those suspicions more clear . “ what we didn ’ t anticipate are attacks of this proportion , ” kersten said . tightening cooperation on all levels since then , the improvement between law enforcement on the national , state and local level has improved significantly , kersten said .
cooperation with fellow european and american investigators is getting better as well . “ i don ’ t want to say that we ’ ve already reached the optimum level in cooperation , ” he said .
“ but if i look back two or three years , at the international cooperation back then as compared to right now , i think we ’ ve made a major step forward and i don ’ t see any other alternative . ”
still , any expectations that terrorist activity in germany has been stopped once and for all are misleading . as evidence , investigators point to the april attack on a synagogue in tunisia that killed 21 , including 14 german tourists .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 06.09.2002 radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-terrorism officials warn of new attacks - possibly on german soil the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .
but much work remains and the country ’ s top terrorism officials warn more attacks might be in store . september 11 could become an opportunity for radical islamic groups to launch new attacks on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in history , germany ’ s top anti-terrorism officials said this week . in an interview with reuters , manfred klink , who headed the german investigation into the sept .
11 plot , said that germany ’ s anti-terrorism investigators had concluded attacks were currently in the planning stage . " we believe that both al qaeda and non-aligned groups are involved in planning such attacks , although we have no firm evidence of anything specific planned for september 11 , " klink told reuters this week . " i do n't know if al qaeda attaches much importance to anniversaries but we will be on alert on this day as others on the same wavelength as al qaeda , without necessarily being members , may find september 11 a good opportunity to strike . " shaken by the realization that the sept .
11 attacks may have been planned in hamburg , germany ’ s government has initiated a vigorous anti-terror campaign .
in two “ security packages ” passed by the german parliament , law enforcement saw increases in their budgets and personnel . the government also passed a law banning religious organizations that push extremist views , such as the cologne-based caliph state .
the caliph state ’ s leader metin kaplan is currently serving a prison term for calling for the death of a competitor and might be deported to turkey to face trial there . 70 investigations , only 1 indictment over the past year , german investigators have launched 70 investigations into islamic terrorist activity within the country , 50 of those ordered by germany ’ s federal prosecutor , according to ulrich kersten , the head of germany ’ s federal crime office , the bundeskriminalamt , -lrb- bka -rrb- who spoke with dw-radio . though the investigations have resulted in only one indictment , that last week of hamburg student and suspected mohammed atta accomplice mounir el motassadeq , they have shed new light into a murky area , he said . “ we have … a significantly better view into the islamic fundamentalist terrorist network , ” he said in the interview . kersten said that the federal crime agency suspected that islamic fundamentalists were active even before the attacks .
the arrest of a suspected osama bin laden finance chief in munich in 1998 and the break-up of a frankfurt cell planning attacks on the strasbourg christmas market in 2000 , made those suspicions more clear . “ what we didn ’ t anticipate are attacks of this proportion , ” kersten said . tightening cooperation on all levels since then , the improvement between law enforcement on the national , state and local level has improved significantly , kersten said .
cooperation with fellow european and american investigators is getting better as well . “ i don ’ t want to say that we ’ ve already reached the optimum level in cooperation , ” he said .
“ but if i look back two or three years , at the international cooperation back then as compared to right now , i think we ’ ve made a major step forward and i don ’ t see any other alternative . ”
still , any expectations that terrorist activity in germany has been stopped once and for all are misleading . as evidence , investigators point to the april attack on a synagogue in tunisia that killed 21 , including 14 german tourists .
“ we have to figure that at any moment , american , israeli , jewish and maybe also british institutions anywhere in the world could be attacked , " said kersten .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 06.09.2002 radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-terrorism officials warn of new attacks - possibly on german soil the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .
but much work remains and the country ’ s top terrorism officials warn more attacks might be in store . september 11 could become an opportunity for radical islamic groups to launch new attacks on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in history , germany ’ s top anti-terrorism officials said this week . in an interview with reuters , manfred klink , who headed the german investigation into the sept .
11 plot , said that germany ’ s anti-terrorism investigators had concluded attacks were currently in the planning stage . " we believe that both al qaeda and non-aligned groups are involved in planning such attacks , although we have no firm evidence of anything specific planned for september 11 , " klink told reuters this week . " i do n't know if al qaeda attaches much importance to anniversaries but we will be on alert on this day as others on the same wavelength as al qaeda , without necessarily being members , may find september 11 a good opportunity to strike . " shaken by the realization that the sept .
11 attacks may have been planned in hamburg , germany ’ s government has initiated a vigorous anti-terror campaign .
in two “ security packages ” passed by the german parliament , law enforcement saw increases in their budgets and personnel . the government also passed a law banning religious organizations that push extremist views , such as the cologne-based caliph state .
the caliph state ’ s leader metin kaplan is currently serving a prison term for calling for the death of a competitor and might be deported to turkey to face trial there . 70 investigations , only 1 indictment over the past year , german investigators have launched 70 investigations into islamic terrorist activity within the country , 50 of those ordered by germany ’ s federal prosecutor , according to ulrich kersten , the head of germany ’ s federal crime office , the bundeskriminalamt , -lrb- bka -rrb- who spoke with dw-radio . though the investigations have resulted in only one indictment , that last week of hamburg student and suspected mohammed atta accomplice mounir el motassadeq , they have shed new light into a murky area , he said . “ we have … a significantly better view into the islamic fundamentalist terrorist network , ” he said in the interview . kersten said that the federal crime agency suspected that islamic fundamentalists were active even before the attacks .
the arrest of a suspected osama bin laden finance chief in munich in 1998 and the break-up of a frankfurt cell planning attacks on the strasbourg christmas market in 2000 , made those suspicions more clear . “ what we didn ’ t anticipate are attacks of this proportion , ” kersten said . tightening cooperation on all levels since then , the improvement between law enforcement on the national , state and local level has improved significantly , kersten said .
cooperation with fellow european and american investigators is getting better as well . “ i don ’ t want to say that we ’ ve already reached the optimum level in cooperation , ” he said .
“ but if i look back two or three years , at the international cooperation back then as compared to right now , i think we ’ ve made a major step forward and i don ’ t see any other alternative . ”
still , any expectations that terrorist activity in germany has been stopped once and for all are misleading . as evidence , investigators point to the april attack on a synagogue in tunisia that killed 21 , including 14 german tourists .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 06.09.2002 radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-terrorism officials warn of new attacks - possibly on german soil the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .
but much work remains and the country ’ s top terrorism officials warn more attacks might be in store . september 11 could become an opportunity for radical islamic groups to launch new attacks on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in history , germany ’ s top anti-terrorism officials said this week . in an interview with reuters , manfred klink , who headed the german investigation into the sept .
11 plot , said that germany ’ s anti-terrorism investigators had concluded attacks were currently in the planning stage . " we believe that both al qaeda and non-aligned groups are involved in planning such attacks , although we have no firm evidence of anything specific planned for september 11 , " klink told reuters this week . " i do n't know if al qaeda attaches much importance to anniversaries but we will be on alert on this day as others on the same wavelength as al qaeda , without necessarily being members , may find september 11 a good opportunity to strike . " shaken by the realization that the sept .
11 attacks may have been planned in hamburg , germany ’ s government has initiated a vigorous anti-terror campaign .
in two “ security packages ” passed by the german parliament , law enforcement saw increases in their budgets and personnel . the government also passed a law banning religious organizations that push extremist views , such as the cologne-based caliph state .
the caliph state ’ s leader metin kaplan is currently serving a prison term for calling for the death of a competitor and might be deported to turkey to face trial there . 70 investigations , only 1 indictment over the past year , german investigators have launched 70 investigations into islamic terrorist activity within the country , 50 of those ordered by germany ’ s federal prosecutor , according to ulrich kersten , the head of germany ’ s federal crime office , the bundeskriminalamt , -lrb- bka -rrb- who spoke with dw-radio . though the investigations have resulted in only one indictment , that last week of hamburg student and suspected mohammed atta accomplice mounir el motassadeq , they have shed new light into a murky area , he said . “ we have … a significantly better view into the islamic fundamentalist terrorist network , ” he said in the interview . kersten said that the federal crime agency suspected that islamic fundamentalists were active even before the attacks .
the arrest of a suspected osama bin laden finance chief in munich in 1998 and the break-up of a frankfurt cell planning attacks on the strasbourg christmas market in 2000 , made those suspicions more clear . “ what we didn ’ t anticipate are attacks of this proportion , ” kersten said . tightening cooperation on all levels since then , the improvement between law enforcement on the national , state and local level has improved significantly , kersten said .
cooperation with fellow european and american investigators is getting better as well . “ i don ’ t want to say that we ’ ve already reached the optimum level in cooperation , ” he said .
“ but if i look back two or three years , at the international cooperation back then as compared to right now , i think we ’ ve made a major step forward and i don ’ t see any other alternative . ”
still , any expectations that terrorist activity in germany has been stopped once and for all are misleading . as evidence , investigators point to the april attack on a synagogue in tunisia that killed 21 , including 14 german tourists .
“ we have to figure that at any moment , american , israeli , jewish and maybe also british institutions anywhere in the world could be attacked , " said kersten .

" we believe that both al qaeda and non-aligned groups are involved in planning such attacks , although we have no firm evidence of anything specific planned for september 11 , " klink told reuters this week . " i do n't know if al qaeda attaches much importance to anniversaries but we will be on alert on this day as others on the same wavelength as al qaeda , without necessarily being members , may find september 11 a good opportunity to strike . " shaken by the realization that the sept .
11 attacks may have been planned in hamburg , germany ’ s government has initiated a vigorous anti-terror campaign .
in two “ security packages ” passed by the german parliament , law enforcement saw increases in their budgets and personnel . the government also passed a law banning religious organizations that push extremist views , such as the cologne-based caliph state .
the caliph state ’ s leader metin kaplan is currently serving a prison term for calling for the death of a competitor and might be deported to turkey to face trial there . 70 investigations , only 1 indictment over the past year , german investigators have launched 70 investigations into islamic terrorist activity within the country , 50 of those ordered by germany ’ s federal prosecutor , according to ulrich kersten , the head of germany ’ s federal crime office , the bundeskriminalamt , -lrb- bka -rrb- who spoke with dw-radio . though the investigations have resulted in only one indictment , that last week of hamburg student and suspected mohammed atta accomplice mounir el motassadeq , they have shed new light into a murky area , he said . “ we have … a significantly better view into the islamic fundamentalist terrorist network , ” he said in the interview . kersten said that the federal crime agency suspected that islamic fundamentalists were active even before the attacks .
the arrest of a suspected osama bin laden finance chief in munich in 1998 and the break-up of a frankfurt cell planning attacks on the strasbourg christmas market in 2000 , made those suspicions more clear . “ what we didn ’ t anticipate are attacks of this proportion , ” kersten said . tightening cooperation on all levels since then , the improvement between law enforcement on the national , state and local level has improved significantly , kersten said .
cooperation with fellow european and american investigators is getting better as well . “ i don ’ t want to say that we ’ ve already reached the optimum level in cooperation , ” he said .

11 attacks may have been planned in hamburg , germany ’ s government has initiated a vigorous anti-terror campaign .
in two “ security packages ” passed by the german parliament , law enforcement saw increases in their budgets and personnel . the government also passed a law banning religious organizations that push extremist views , such as the cologne-based caliph state .
the caliph state ’ s leader metin kaplan is currently serving a prison term for calling for the death of a competitor and might be deported to turkey to face trial there . 70 investigations , only 1 indictment over the past year , german investigators have launched 70 investigations into islamic terrorist activity within the country , 50 of those ordered by germany ’ s federal prosecutor , according to ulrich kersten , the head of germany ’ s federal crime office , the bundeskriminalamt , -lrb- bka -rrb- who spoke with dw-radio . though the investigations have resulted in only one indictment , that last week of hamburg student and suspected mohammed atta accomplice mounir el motassadeq , they have shed new light into a murky area , he said . “ we have … a significantly better view into the islamic fundamentalist terrorist network , ” he said in the interview . kersten said that the federal crime agency suspected that islamic fundamentalists were active even before the attacks .
the arrest of a suspected osama bin laden finance chief in munich in 1998 and the break-up of a frankfurt cell planning attacks on the strasbourg christmas market in 2000 , made those suspicions more clear . “ what we didn ’ t anticipate are attacks of this proportion , ” kersten said . tightening cooperation on all levels since then , the improvement between law enforcement on the national , state and local level has improved significantly , kersten said .
cooperation with fellow european and american investigators is getting better as well . “ i don ’ t want to say that we ’ ve already reached the optimum level in cooperation , ” he said .
“ but if i look back two or three years , at the international cooperation back then as compared to right now , i think we ’ ve made a major step forward and i don ’ t see any other alternative . ”
still , any expectations that terrorist activity in germany has been stopped once and for all are misleading . as evidence , investigators point to the april attack on a synagogue in tunisia that killed 21 , including 14 german tourists .
“ we have to figure that at any moment , american , israeli , jewish and maybe also british institutions anywhere in the world could be attacked , " said kersten .

but much work remains and the country ’ s top terrorism officials warn more attacks might be in store . september 11 could become an opportunity for radical islamic groups to launch new attacks on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in history , germany ’ s top anti-terrorism officials said this week . in an interview with reuters , manfred klink , who headed the german investigation into the sept .
11 plot , said that germany ’ s anti-terrorism investigators had concluded attacks were currently in the planning stage . " we believe that both al qaeda and non-aligned groups are involved in planning such attacks , although we have no firm evidence of anything specific planned for september 11 , " klink told reuters this week . " i do n't know if al qaeda attaches much importance to anniversaries but we will be on alert on this day as others on the same wavelength as al qaeda , without necessarily being members , may find september 11 a good opportunity to strike . " shaken by the realization that the sept .
11 attacks may have been planned in hamburg , germany ’ s government has initiated a vigorous anti-terror campaign .
in two “ security packages ” passed by the german parliament , law enforcement saw increases in their budgets and personnel . the government also passed a law banning religious organizations that push extremist views , such as the cologne-based caliph state .
the caliph state ’ s leader metin kaplan is currently serving a prison term for calling for the death of a competitor and might be deported to turkey to face trial there . 70 investigations , only 1 indictment over the past year , german investigators have launched 70 investigations into islamic terrorist activity within the country , 50 of those ordered by germany ’ s federal prosecutor , according to ulrich kersten , the head of germany ’ s federal crime office , the bundeskriminalamt , -lrb- bka -rrb- who spoke with dw-radio . though the investigations have resulted in only one indictment , that last week of hamburg student and suspected mohammed atta accomplice mounir el motassadeq , they have shed new light into a murky area , he said . “ we have … a significantly better view into the islamic fundamentalist terrorist network , ” he said in the interview . kersten said that the federal crime agency suspected that islamic fundamentalists were active even before the attacks .
the arrest of a suspected osama bin laden finance chief in munich in 1998 and the break-up of a frankfurt cell planning attacks on the strasbourg christmas market in 2000 , made those suspicions more clear . “ what we didn ’ t anticipate are attacks of this proportion , ” kersten said . tightening cooperation on all levels since then , the improvement between law enforcement on the national , state and local level has improved significantly , kersten said .
cooperation with fellow european and american investigators is getting better as well . “ i don ’ t want to say that we ’ ve already reached the optimum level in cooperation , ” he said .
“ but if i look back two or three years , at the international cooperation back then as compared to right now , i think we ’ ve made a major step forward and i don ’ t see any other alternative . ”
still , any expectations that terrorist activity in germany has been stopped once and for all are misleading . as evidence , investigators point to the april attack on a synagogue in tunisia that killed 21 , including 14 german tourists .
“ we have to figure that at any moment , american , israeli , jewish and maybe also british institutions anywhere in the world could be attacked , " said kersten .

but britain was not america 's puppet , the prime minister said in an interview with the bbc two programme hotline to the president , to be screened on sunday . "
they -lrb- the us -rrb- need to know , 'are you prepared to commit , are you prepared to be there when the shooting starts ? '
" tony blair uk prime minister mr blair - who has promised to publish a dossier of evidence against iraq in the coming weeks - said the threat of chemical and biological weapons in the hands of " highly unstable states " could not be ignored .
he told the hotline programme : " in the end , britain is a sovereign nation .
britain decides its own policy and although i back america i would never back america if i thought they were doing something wrong .
" if i thought that by committing military action in a way that was wrong , i would not support it .
but i have never found that and i do n't expect to find it in the future . "
mr blair will meet president bush on saturday at camp david , in a meeting that is likely to discuss who could succeed saddam , but which advisers have said is not " a council of war " .
meanwhile , president bush is continuing a diplomatic offensive to win support for an attack on iraq , seeking to persuade key members of the un security council to back his campaign to oust saddam hussein .
the president is expected to telephone on friday the leaders of france , russia and china , who are all sceptical about the need for military action .
mr blair will meet russian president vladimir putin in moscow in early october , and although the visit is said to be long-planned , mr putin is regarded as a vital player in decisions about how to confront iraq .
' when shooting starts ' hotline to the president presenter michael cockerell asked mr blair whether one of the elements of the uk-us special relationship was whether " britain is prepared to send troops to commit themselves , to pay the blood price " .
mr blair replied : " yes .
what is important though is that at moments of crisis they -lrb- the usa -rrb- do n't need to know simply that you are giving general expressions of support and sympathy .
" that is easy , frankly .
they need to know , 'are you prepared to commit , are you prepared to be there when the shooting starts ? " '
the prime minister added : " we are not at the stage of decision on iraq , and there are all sorts of different ways in which we might decide to deal with this iraqi problem in the end .
" but what you can not do is to say that this issue of weapons of mass destruction , proliferation of chemical weapons , biological weapons and nuclear capability in the hands of highly unstable states ... that these are issues that do n't need to be dealt with . "

but britain was not america 's puppet , the prime minister said in an interview with the bbc two programme hotline to the president , to be screened on sunday .
they -lrb- the us -rrb- need to know , 'are you prepared to commit , are you prepared to be there when the shooting starts ? '
tony blair uk prime minister mr blair - who has promised to publish a dossier of evidence against iraq in the coming weeks - said the threat of chemical and biological weapons in the hands of " highly unstable states " could not be ignored .
he told the hotline programme : " in the end , britain is a sovereign nation .
britain decides its own policy and although i back america i would never back america if i thought they were doing something wrong .
" if i thought that by committing military action in a way that was wrong , i would not support it .
but i have never found that and i do n't expect to find it in the future . "
blair denies he is a us puppet mr blair will meet president bush on saturday at camp david , in a meeting that is likely to discuss who could succeed saddam , but which advisers have said is not " a council of war " .
meanwhile , president bush is continuing a diplomatic offensive to win support for an attack on iraq , seeking to persuade key members of the un security council to back his campaign to oust saddam hussein .
the president is expected to telephone on friday the leaders of france , russia and china , who are all sceptical about the need for military action .
mr blair will meet russian president vladimir putin in moscow in early october , and although the visit is said to be long-planned , mr putin is regarded as a vital player in decisions about how to confront iraq .
' when shooting starts ' hotline to the president presenter michael cockerell asked mr blair whether one of the elements of the uk-us special relationship was whether " britain is prepared to send troops to commit themselves , to pay the blood price " .
iraqis face an uncertain future mr blair replied : " yes .
what is important though is that at moments of crisis they -lrb- the usa -rrb- do n't need to know simply that you are giving general expressions of support and sympathy .
" that is easy , frankly .
they need to know , 'are you prepared to commit , are you prepared to be there when the shooting starts ? " '
the prime minister added : " we are not at the stage of decision on iraq , and there are all sorts of different ways in which we might decide to deal with this iraqi problem in the end .
" but what you can not do is to say that this issue of weapons of mass destruction , proliferation of chemical weapons , biological weapons and nuclear capability in the hands of highly unstable states ... that these are issues that do n't need to be dealt with . "

christopher gillberg , professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at st george 's medical school , london , told the bbc there is little to suggest that mmr has anything to do with autism .
and the intense focus on the effect of the triple vaccine has stymied potentially far more fruitful avenues of research into a condition which is still little understood .
his comments come as the department of health launches a website to provide information to parents about mmr .
this whole mmr business has taken on proportions that have hampered research in autism professor christopher gillberg a 1998 study showed one in 1,000 children were affected by autism .
experts say the figure is set to rise .
but professor gillberg , who will present a review of 40 major studies of the causes of autism to the annual conference of the national autistic society -lrb- nas -rrb- in london on friday , said that was because diagnosis and awareness had improved , not because there were more cases .
he said he had not seen " a shred of evidence " to link the measles , mumps and rubella vaccination , or any other immunisation , to autism .
professor gillberg said : " i think this whole mmr business has taken on proportions that have hampered research in autism .
" people are concentrating so much on disputing this or finding this or finding that in relation to mmr , when there has never been any strong evidence that this would be a road we should be travelling . "
he added : " there are so many other clues to autism we have spent a lot of time in vain on debating this particular aspect because you can pick on anything and say we think this might be linked to autism and , interesting as it might be , i think you should follow the leads where there might be evidence . "
he said autism was more likely to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors .
media hype however , he says a link with mmr can not be completely ruled out , and that the controversial study which first made the connection should be replicated before it can be ruled in or out .
professor gillberg said 10 years ago research had concentrated on whether facilitated communication was a cure for autism because that was being hyped by the media .
if we start looking at environmental issues that could cause autism , mmr should be considered jonathan harris , jabs he said many expensive long-term studies had been carried out and shown it had no effect .
" but just because there was hype in the media everyone had to test it . "
jonathan harris , a spokesman for justice awareness and basic support -lrb- jabs -rrb- , said research into autism must look at mmr .
" it must be acknowledged that there 's a group of autistic children who do not conform to any of the present definitions of autism , " he said .
" if anything good has come from the mmr issue , it 's that the awareness of autism is greater .
" if we start looking at environmental issues that could cause autism , mmr should be considered as part of that . "
the nas says autism is being detected earlier , partly because babies are observed differently , such as through home videos , and partly because it is now known that early intervention can help .
symptoms are often spotted when a child is between 18 months and two-years-old .
they can include difficulty communicating and an obsession with patterns and numbers .
vernon beauchamp of the nas told the bbc : " we agree that if mmr could take too much priority and emphasis looking at this , that 's not a good thing .
" there 's a far wider range of areas which do need far more focus and research .

policing board chairman professor desmond rea has urged everyone to back a major campaign to recruit independent members to the partnerships .
he also called on sinn fein to join the bodies .
the recruitment drive was launched on friday .
as well as locally elected representatives , up to nine other people will sit in each of the 29 consultative bodies .
belfast will have four boards and each of the 25 other district council areas will have one each .
they will operate as sub-committees of the councils , advising on policing priorities and holding police commanders in their areas to account .
' clear message ' they are expected to be up and running by early next year .
sinn fein is the only one of northern ireland 's four main parties which has refused to accept northern ireland 's new policing arrangements following the changeover from the royal ulster constabulary to the police service of northern ireland last november .
sinn fein said it would not sit on the new partnerships until the patten recommendations were fully implemented .
the party 's north belfast assembly member , gerry kelly , said the partnerships would not have enough power .
" the dpps have even less power than the policing board .
it is logical that if we did not join the policing board because we do n't have what was promised in patten , then it is logical that we should not join the dpps , which have even less power . "

" if dpps are to be really effective we need their members to represent a broad range of interests in the community , and to be ready to work hard to improve the quality of life in their area , " he said .
" voices from all communities must be heard .
" this is an important opportunity in the development of truly effective policing here and we are confident that the people of northern ireland will grasp it with both hands . "
interviews the board chairman said people were concerned about rising crime rates in northern ireland .
" crimes such as vandalism , burglary , drug abuse and domestic violence are all things we would like to see an end to .
" but it is clear that the police need our help in tackling these problems if things are to change for the better , " he said .
a promotional campaign is expected to get under way next week .
people will have the chance to submit applications from 23 september and short listing and interviews will take place between then and november .

mr bungey will be succeeded by david hearn , the new york-based chief executive and chairman of cordiant 's main advertising arm , bates worldwide .
the announcement was made as cordiant reported pre-tax profit and one-off items of £ 11.5m -lrb- $ 18m -rrb- for the first half of the year .
the figure marked a big fall from the profit of £ 22.1m that cordiant posted in the same period last year , and the company added that underlying revenues fell by 12 % .
mr bungey warned that the outlook for the advertising market remained bleak .
' depressed trading levels persist throughout our markets , " he said in a statement .
" whilst conditions may have stabilised , i see no signs of a recovery anytime soon , " he added .
cordiant also said that it would restructure some of its business , bringing several units together as bates group to create " an inherently more efficient and effective service structure for clients " .
ad slump mr bungey 's departure had been widely expected .
cordiant has been badly hit by the global downturn in spending on advertising .
and it has lost a number of large clients including wendy 's international and the south korean carmaker hyundai .
since peaking at 406 pence in march 2000 , the company 's share price has tumbled and on thursday it closed at 47.5p.
last year cordiant cut 1,600 staff - which accounted for 17 % of its workforce - and issued three profit warnings .

the department of health is committed to providing 700 public access defibrillators in 72 sites across england and wales , including airports and shopping centres .
but a study carried out by doctors at glasgow university suggests that the policy is unlikely to have much effect .
the essential question in a system with limited resources is whether the money can be better spent in a different way to save more lives professor stuart cobbe the researchers used records of 15,189 heart attacks that took place outside a hospital between 1991 and 1998 to estimate how many lives public access defibrillators would have saved .
nearly eight out of ten -lrb- 79 % -rrb- of the heart attacks took place at sites - such as in the home - where people would not have been able to access a defibrillator .
just 18 % occurred in suitable sites , such as shops , places of business or sport centres , while another 3 % occurred in possibly suitable sites , such as buses and multi-storey car parks .
the authors predict that locating public access defibrillators only in suitable sites would increase the survival rate from 5.0 % to 6.3 % .
if defibrillators were located in suitable and possibly suitable sites , the survival rate would increase only slightly further to 6.5 % .
better alternatives the researchers say that more lives would potentially be saved by giving other emergency services , such as the police , assess to defibrillators , and training the public in basic life-saving skills .
lead researcher professor stuart cobbe said : " introduction of public access defibrillators will save a small number of lives according to our analysis .
" while every life saved is to be welcomed , the essential question in a system with limited resources is whether the money can be better spent in a different way to save more lives . "
katharine peel , head of emergency life support at the british heart foundation , echoed professor cobbe 's views .
she said : " because 70 % of cardiac arrests occur outside hospital and 70 % of those occur at home , widespread training is needed to increase the likelihood of cpr -lrb- cardiopulmonary resuscitation -rrb- or early defibrillation being performed before the arrival of the emergency services . "
early initiation of cpr , including ' mouth to mouth ' and chest compressions , doubles the chance of survival .
ambulance view jonathan fox , of the association of professional ambulance personnel , agreed that educating the public to provide cpr would save many lives .
he said : " without a radical sea-change in culture amongst the public towards learning this life-saving skill , it will be impossible for the national service framework for coronary heart disease , with its aim to save 3,000 additional lives annually from cardiac arrest , to be realised regardless of the skilled intervention of paramedics or first responders attending . "
a spokeswoman for the department of health said government figures for survival rates after a cardiac arrest differed greatly from those in the study .
she said : " where defibrillators in public places have been used so far under the department 's initiative they have increased survival rates after cardiac arrest from 1-2 % to 13 % - we do not consider this a marginal improvement .
" what this study does confirm is that 20 % of cardiac arrests occur in public places where survival without early defibrillation is very poor .
this is the very reason the initiative was set up in 2000 . "
a defibrillator is an electrical device with two paddles that are placed on the chest .
it discharges electricity through the heart when a lethal rhythm is present .
the goal is to shock the heart back to normal .

that meant big trouble .
at least , so it appeared in 1993 when , within days of the formation of " superunion " unison , claiming more than 1.5 million members , its leader alan jinkinson was warning of a " winter of hostility " .
" we are prepared to lock horns with the government , " mr jinkinson said , fighting a threat to freeze public sector pay , and setting unison on a collision with employers ' group the cbi .
nine years later , mr jinkinson , retired from unison , has added a government advisership to his cv , and levels of industrial unrest , if turning up , are among their lowest levels for a century .
" people may talk about discontent , but for every working day lost in strikes last year , there were 50 lost in 1979 , " said nigel stanley , head of communications at the tuc .
and while the process of union merger has continued , with amicus the most recent giant created , even the cbi feels relaxed about the coming of unions which - with unison boasting revenues of £ 118m last year - have the financial clout of a large public company .
" it is not so much the size of a union which is important but its willingness to co-operate , " said cbi spokeswoman katja klasson .
size not everything despite the superunions , levels of public sector pay remain low .
and , suffering poor holiday entitlement , long working hours , poor management , and shrinking pensions , workers in the privatel sector have plenty to shout about , the tuc believes .
so superunions - super-disappointment ?
" the idea that bigger size means more industrial muscle is not necessarily true , " mr stanley says .
take aslef , the train drivers ' union , which claims but 17,000 members , yet is known by millions .
" aslef is a small union , but has industrial muscle galore , " he added .
while superunions may boast a membership which , in unison 's case , exceeds 1.3 million , that does not present a charter for industrial blackmail .
" unions ca n't just pull people out on strike like that , " mr stanley said .
" law prevents , for instance , sympathy strikes . "
merger drive to understand britain 's union giants requires a finer appreciation of labour representation .
" for a start they are not superunions , whatever people may call them , " said professor peter fairbrother , a trade union expert at cardiff university .
" they are big unions , perhaps .
but not what was meant by superunions when the term was first used in the 1980s . "
the idea then was that superunions should be formed through consolidation along sector lines , as occurred in mr fairbrother 's native australia .
there a programme backed by both workers and ministers saw the number of unions cut from 143 to 48 between 1989 and 1995 .
" in britain , unions may have merged , but not restricted themselves by sector , " mr fairbrother said .
local or national ?
furthermore , they have formed in reaction to events , rather than as part of a pro-active government-backed drive , said dr jeremy waddington , reader at umist 's manchester school of management .
" what unions found they had to cope with was , after 1979 , a protracted period of membership decline , " he said .
union mergers 2001 : msf and aeeu combine as amicus 1997 : civil service unions ptc and cpsa form pcs 1995 : ncu and ucw merge as communication workers union 1993 : unison formed from nalgo , nupe and cohse 1993 : aeu and eetpu merge as aeeu " employment shifted away from manufacturing to private sector services , to firms with smaller workplaces higher rates of turnover - things unions found difficult to cope with . "
union membership fell from 12 million in 1979 to about 7 million today .
and this decline co-incided with a period of localisation which , ironically , favoured the formation of broad-based union " conglomerates " .
" what was saw was the growth of local bargaining , instead of deals being struck at a national level , " mr waddington said .
" this meant unions had to get involved in more negotiations , and expend more resources , yet their income was under pressure because of the membership decline . "
smaller unions found themselves unable to meet their administration bills .
" larger unions were better placed to be able to take advantage of economies of scale .
to provide , say , the extra training needed for negotiators . "
long standing process a further catalyst was the relaxation in 1964 of laws which had made it " nigh on impossible " for unions to merge .
" in fact , the merger process in british trade unions is nothing new , " mr waddington said .
" the formation of the gmb from the boilermakers ' union and the national union of general and municipal workers in 1982 - that would be the creation of a superunion in modern parlance . "
power focus what is new , however , is the proportion of union members claimed by the large uk unions .
" the bigger organisations are organising more of the uk 's total union membership than before , " mr waddington said .
and that has implications not so much for employers , but the tuc , as the overarching body of the uk 's union movement .
" what it does is concentrate power in fewer hands .
" so when sir ken jackson failed to gain re-election at amicus , and his successor is appears not to be so favourable towards europe , that could lead to a shift in tuc policy towards europe . "
the power focus could even lead to the decline of the tuc altogether , if the uk follows germany and sees three unions account for 85 % of members .
" imagine you are the german chancellor , gerhard schroeder , and you want to set public sector pay .
would you talk to the german equivalent of the tuc , or go to the guy who runs the main public sector union ? "
the answer : cut out the middle man .
" the question too is being asked in britain ' what is the role of a confederation ' , although any serious challenge seems a way down the track . "
gender issue indeed , where unison does see its membership dynamics count is in talks the government , the kind of area which the tuc might traditionally expect to cover .
" we are the biggest labour party affiliate , so we have a lot of influence , " said unison spokeswoman mary maguire .
" we have a team of very experienced negotiators .
while our members have staged industrial action , it is only as a last resort . "
not that it is just the size of unison 's membership that counts , but its make-up too - its female majority , by a ratio of two-to-one .
" because we have a large proportion of women , we have a different way of doing things , " ms maguire said .
" we do not have the tub thumping culture of some traditional unions . "
unity question so will unison bosses distance themselves from the sabre rattling promised for next week 's tuc conference ?
delegates might question the benefit of disunity at a time when the union movement is again a force to be reckoned with .
and , if mr waddington is to be believed , there is too much substance yet to the tuc for its vocalism to be likened to the din from an empty drum .

" the formation of the gmb from the boilermakers ' union and the national union of general and municipal workers in 1982 - that would be the creation of a superunion in modern parlance . "
power focus what is new , however , is the proportion of union members claimed by the large uk unions .
derek simpson : to influence tuc policy ?
" the bigger organisations are organising more of the uk 's total union membership than before , " mr waddington said .
and that has implications not so much for employers , but the tuc , as the overarching body of the uk 's union movement .
" what it does is concentrate power in fewer hands .
" so when sir ken jackson failed to gain re-election at amicus , and his successor is appears not to be so favourable towards europe , that could lead to a shift in tuc policy towards europe . "
the power focus could even lead to the decline of the tuc altogether , if the uk follows germany and sees three unions account for 85 % of members .
" imagine you are the german chancellor , gerhard schroeder , and you want to set public sector pay .
would you talk to the german equivalent of the tuc , or go to the guy who runs the main public sector union ? "
the answer : cut out the middle man .
" the question too is being asked in britain ' what is the role of a confederation ' , although any serious challenge seems a way down the track . "
gender issue indeed , where unison does see its membership dynamics count is in talks the government , the kind of area which the tuc might traditionally expect to cover .
" we are the biggest labour party affiliate , so we have a lot of influence , " said unison spokeswoman mary maguire .
" we have a team of very experienced negotiators .
while our members have staged industrial action , it is only as a last resort . "
not that it is just the size of unison 's membership that counts , but its make-up too - its female majority , by a ratio of two-to-one .
" because we have a large proportion of women , we have a different way of doing things , " ms maguire said .
" we do not have the tub thumping culture of some traditional unions . "
unity question so will unison bosses distance themselves from the sabre rattling promised for next week 's tuc conference ?
delegates might question the benefit of disunity at a time when the union movement is again a force to be reckoned with .
and , if mr waddington is to be believed , there is too much substance yet to the tuc for its vocalism to be likened to the din from an empty drum .

the trades union congress is the oldest , and at one time the most powerful representative body of working people in the world .
founded in 1868 , it co-ordinated the efforts of skilled workers to gain recognition from employers and lobbied the government to give more rights to workers .
the tuc general council in 1921- when it first met it took the unions nearly 40 years to ensure the right to strike , and in the process of political lobbying they established a parliamentary committee that eventually became the labour party .
from the early days of the labour party , most mps were trades unionists , and the unions provided the funds and the local organisation for the party .
from skilled to unskilled the importance of the unions in the political process was paralleled by the extension of their own membership to the mass of unskilled workers from their original base in skilled workers .
the 1926 general strike was the peak of union power by the l920s , boosted by the industrial struggles of the first world war , the great industrial unions like the transport and general workers union and the general and municipal workers were formed .
they led a general strike in 1926 to support the unsuccessful attempt of the coal miners to maintain their wage rates in the face of the slump .
in an uncanny parallel to the present , the turner-mond talks of the late l920s - an early attempt to build industrial partnership - were the result of the failure of the industrial militancy of the first quarter of the century .
in another parallel to today , the labour party - which formed its first two governments in the 1920s - also sought to distance itself from the unions .
international issues have always concerned the tuc indeed , the l929 labour government fell from power when ramsay macdonald decided he had to follow the advice of city bankers rather than his trade union allies in the financial crisis brought on by the wall street crash .
the pinnacle of power the second world war boosted union membership to unprecedented heights - and the co-ordination of industrial production brought the unions to the heart of government - with transport and general workers union leader ernest bevin becoming minister of labour .
union leader ernest bevin joined churchill in the war cabinet the 1945 labour government did much to strengthen the role of unions in the political system by attempting - at first successfully - to restrain wages and raise productivity by a series of voluntary deals .
these reforms culminated in a " tripartite " system of consultation between unions , business and government .
by the l960s it sometimes seemed that the unions were more powerful than the government in setting economic policy .
mrs thatcher and the unions but by the 1970s the unions were held responsible for some of the industrial decline of the uk economy , and pay policy became untenable in the face of worldwide inflation .
militancy and strikes have declined since the l970s mrs thatcher 's conservative government came to power in l979 determined to reduce the power of the trade unions .
her defeat of the miners in strike in l984 , as much as the development of legislation to make strike more difficult , changed the climate of industrial relations permanently .
the number of strikes declined to record lows , as unions sought partnership rather than confrontation in a climate of high unemployment .
" fairness , not favours " after the electoral defeats of the l980s , the labour party sought to distance itself from the trade union movement .
mr blair had new friends rather than the unions firstly , by introducing one member , one vote it sought to reduce the influence of the union bloc vote at party conferences .
under tony blair , the process went further .
he pushed through the reform of clause four , the labour party 's commitment to socialism , against union opposition .
and he made it clear that he would not repeal the bulk of conservative trade union legislation .
" fairness , not favours , " would be labour 's policy towards the unions , mr blair proclaimed .
although labour in power has implemented its electoral commitments to the minimum wage and union rights to recognition in the workplace , the government - in union eyes - has often seemed more interested in wooing business interests .
a new generation of leaders sought partnership with companies but many new rights have been won because labour has adopted the social chapter of eu legislation .
in its second term , tony blair has committed his government to reforming the public sector with higher taxes to pay for better services .
but unions fear that reform will mean lower wages and worse conditions for workers in the public sector - who now make up a majority of union members .
and they now fear that the government is rushing into a war against iraq .
with the strong economy boosting union power , the stage may be set for an historic confrontation .

iraq has the potential to be one of the richest countries in the world .
but , in pursuit of illusory conquests , the country 's leaders have squandered its resources on the vagaries of war .
much of the blame can be laid at the door of iraqi president saddam hussein , who has once again incited america 's wrath .
but the imposition of united nations sanctions throughout the 1990s also straitjacketed the country 's economic development .
the victims in this drama have been the long-suffering iraqi people , many of whom live hand-to-mouth , surviving on food rations from the un oil-for-food programme .
" the country has effectively been at war for 22 years , " says neil partrick of the economist intelligence unit -lrb- eiu -rrb- .
suffering in a population of 23 million , many are desperately poor and at least half of the adult males are unemployed .
" it is no longer as bad as it was , " says george galloway , the british mp and vocal campaigner against sanctions .
" when i visited the country in 1993 , there was no oil-for-food programme and iraq was really on its knees .
" people would literally fall down in the street through weakness and hunger . "
for a country that still has a middle class and was once relatively prosperous , salaries are laughably low .
hotel workers earn about $ 7 a month , while doctors make $ 20 and university professors earn $ 30 .
only people involved in the black market manage to live " ostentatiously " , while families with relatives outside the country live on precious hand-outs , says mr galloway .
minnow with giant potential ?
the main prop for the economy has been the country 's significant oil reserves , which if exploited properly could rival saudi arabia .
iraq 's dark years 1980-88 : war with iran august 1990 : iraq invades kuwait 1991 : gulf war 1996 : un oil-for-food programme allows iraq to sell oil in return for imports of food and humanitarian supplies 1999 : limits on oil exports lifted may 2002 : most limits on imports lifted in the heyday of 1979 - one year before an eight-year war with iran - iraq produced 3.5 million barrels of oil a day .
following the war , oil facilities were damaged , contributing to $ 100bn in economic losses for iraq , according to the british foreign office .
the gulf war in 1991 and harsh economic sanctions also battered the economy - crude estimates from the eiu calculate that the economy contracted by 50 % that year .
since then , the un has slowly eased its restrictions on iraq , but the country has still struggled to return to form .
its oil production has not exceeded 2.5 million barrels a day since 1991 , even though iraq has the potential reserves to produce six million a day , says mr partrick .
held up the reasons for iraq 's stunted growth range from dips in the oil price to president saddam 's fondness for turning off the country 's oil taps to show his displeasure of western ' meddling ' .
iraq has also failed to upgrade its oil infrastructure .
this is partly because the government has opted to spend much of its money on defence - possibly building up an arsenal of chemical weapons - and maintaining its power base .
however , the un regime has also made it difficult for the iraqis to import spare parts for upgrading facilities .
requests for new equipment have frequently been held up by un sanction committees because of concerns they might be put to military use .
lack of investment oil experts have visited iraq to examine ways of boosting the industry , but since 11 september the us and the uk have put a stop to any foreign investment .
iraq 's current trading partners , which oppose military strikes by the us , include russia , jordan , syria and egypt .
jordan , for example , is dependent on iraq for its entire domestic oil needs , says carlin doyle of oxford economic forecasting .
even nato member turkey has bemoaned iraq 's economic isolation - it says it has lost about $ 40bn because of trade restrictions since the gulf war .
war impact any military attack by the us and the uk would inevitably disrupt iraq 's oil exports .
strikes would also damage infrastructure and lead to civilian casualties , both of which would feed through into a worsening of the economic situation .
surprisingly , however , the eiu is predicting that iraq could experience an economic rebound next year in spite of any war .
" oil exports fluctuate anyway , so the impact would not be huge in that context , " says mr partrick , who believes any war would be short-lived .
he adds that a possible change in regime as a result of war could also lead to economic reforms .
this view is backed by ian bremmer , president of the research firm , eurasia group , who argues that it has not been in president saddam 's interests to open up the economy completely .
" -lsb- his -rsb- power base would become vulnerable in the event of a rapid re-opening of international trade links and unrestricted flows of labour and investment , " he says .
so , perversely , yet another war could deal iraq a few good cards .
but as the us and the uk ponder their options , the horror of previous conflicts will be only too vivid in the minds of ordinary iraqis .

commission junction is a buoyant firm within a buoyant sector - internet advertising .
spending on online ads rose by 7 % in the uk last year , compared with a 4 % fall in advertising revenues overall , the advertising association said .
and , despite economic downturn and market meltdown , the sector is poised for further gains , and set to more than double over the next two years , forrester research believes .
danny meadows-klue at the interactive advertising bureau says : " the internet is still a growing medium , more and more people are logging on every day , and revenues are growing to reflect that . "
' come of age ' yet it is not simply gains in audience figures which are driving the change , but advances in technology too .
" in the last two years internet advertising has really come of age , " mr meadows-klue said .
" what technology means is that you can do things through websites that offline advertisers can only dream of . "
stores can , for instance , update prices on their sites every second to promote the latest bargains .
" think of it like a news website updating itself with the latest story . "
firms can reach customers quickly and directly through e-mail , or text messages .
new capabilities technology also allows advertisers to ensure they only pay for campaigns which are proving effective in gaining custom .
ever wondered what results advertisers see for the huge sums spent on marketing drives ?
so did the developers of the so-called " pay for performance " software , which allows advertisers to see how many surfers an internet ad attracted , and how much each respondent spent .
advertisers can discover the sites on which their ads thrived , and which parts of a campaign could have been pulled without hitting revenue .
' high conversion rates ' such software has proved lucrative for firms such as espotting , and us-based overture , which saw revenues surge by 179 % last year .
no longer is it about numbers of clicks , but conversion nicky iapino , commission junction overture auctions off the " sponsored link " boxes found on search engines such as msn , with advertisers paying only when the link is used by a surfer .
" you only pay when we deliver a customer who is actively looking for your service or product , " said jim bridgend , sales director at the firm 's uk office .
an " extremely high " proportion of surfers who use the sponsored links subsequently become customers , claims overture , which has 60,000 clients worldwide , including , in the uk , british airways , dixons and lloyds tsb .
points make prizes the commission junction model refines this idea such that it is only when an advert results in a deal , not just a click through , that advertisers pay .

the platform also allows publishers to choose which adverts to show , assessing the most lucrative advertisers by an " earnings per click " rating .
" publishers can see which adverts are likely to give the best returns , and judge which ones to take on that basis . "
advertisers , meanwhile , can try to maximise their rating by limiting the sites on which they permit their ads to appear .
" if you are selling toys or clothes , and your ads are appearing on , say , a fishing site , you are not likely to convert much of any traffic that comes through , " ms iapino says .

human rights group amnesty international estimates that up to 1,000 political prisoners are currently in detention .
internet journalist zouhair yahyaoui was jailed in june , for what human rights campaigners believe was making fun of president zine al-abidine ben ali on his web-site , www.tunezine.com.
press freedom watchdog reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- says that the tunisian government censors the internet more tightly than any other country in the world , with the possible exception of china .
personal details " tunisia has developed an elaborate system of control , using sophisticated cyber-police , " says virginie locussol from rsf 's north africa and middle east desk .
tunisia 's cyber-cops bar access to non-approved web-sites intercept e-mails control internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- monitor internet cafes send computer viruses to dissidents source : rsf mr yahyaoui 's fiancée , sophie elwarda , told bbc news online : " if you go to an internet cafe , you must be very careful not to leave any personal details on the computer . "
otherwise , she says that you might be arrested by the cyber-police if you have visited any dissenting websites .
ms elwarda said that both main isps were run by relatives of president ben ali .
when opening an e-mail account , people must supply copies of their identity card , according to rsf .
cyber-joke cyber-dissident mr yahyaoui is being held in conditions resembling a concentration camp , his fiancée said .
" more than 80 men share a single room .
sometimes there is n't even enough space to sleep . "
president ben ali has been in power since 1987 " they only have water for half an hour every day . "
his family is only allowed to visit him once a week and any nutritious food they give him is taken away , ms elwarda said .
mr hammami reported similar conditions after his release on wednesday .
the web journalist was arrested in 4 june and on 10 july was sentenced to 2 years in prison for " publishing false news " .
despite the tight cyber-censorship , the united nations-run international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- has decided to hold a major summit in tunis in 2005 .
the decision to hold the world summit on the information society in tunisia was condemned by rsf .
" if it was n't so serious , anyone knowing a little about the situation in tunisia with the internet and press freedom generally might be able to laugh about it , " says rsf .

the concert , a prelude to the nfl american football season , was also intended to commemorate the victims of 11 september .
the area around times square and 42nd street became a car-free zone , with a crowd of at least 100,000 people gathering , and nfl estimates as high as 500,000 .
an area stretching 20 blocks was closed to motor vehicles , and heavy security was in force with 5,700 police officers deployed and backpacks and bags restricted .
enrique iglesias was a crowd-pleaser but city leaders believe the free show will have given a huge boost to the tourism trade , still recovering after the 11 september attacks .
with its giant advertising displays and broadway shows , the area around times square is famous for its bright lights .
but for the concert it became even more glitzy , with dozens of spotlights trained on a huge open-air stage .
top of the bill was the band bon jovi , with a supporting cast that included alicia keys , eve and enrique iglesias .
there was a patriotic finish to the show with bon jovi performing america the beautiful while police officers unfurled a giant us flag across the watching crowd .
city 's resilience " we are trying to find some optimism , " said lead singer jon bon jovi , before the concert .
" we want to celebrate the resilience of new york and new yorkers , and show the world we are grateful for their thoughts and prayers . "
it was a sentiment echoed by those in the crowd tonight , among them new yorker kyle gauthier .
bon jovi were the main attraction " fun is very important to us , " he told bbc news online .
" it proves new york is back - back to having a good time .
" we are not afraid of anything , and this restores confidence among americans . "
lara mercer from rhode island agreed , saying it would send a message to the terrorists : " it shows that we are strong , and no matter what happens , we are just going to beat them , " she said .
times square 's famous giant video screens showed images of american football players meeting new york police officers and firefighters .
helicopter journey there was also a poignant salute to members of the new york fire department american football team , the bravest , which lost players in the september attacks .
at the end of the show , bon jovi were taken by helicopter to giants stadium , new jersey to perform at half time .
in the opening game of the new season , the giants played the san francisco 49ers , a clash eagerly awaited by fans of american football .
kyle gauthier : ' fun is very important to us ' the nfl is donating millions of dollars to the city , both for redevelopment projects and for ceremonies planned to mark the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks .
among the rock fans , on holiday from los angeles , was richard hiskey .
he thought the concert was a powerful response to the events of 11 september .
" if something similar had happened in london , and they tied it in with the start of the english premier league , you can imagine the impact it would have , " he said .
" you ca n't keep new yorkers down .
you may knock us down , but we jump right back up again and kick your ass . "
increased numbers the authorities in new york may use slightly different language , but they are clearly hoping that this event will send a message to the world that new york is recovering .
figures released this week show that despite the attacks on the world trade center , more americans visited the city last year than in 2000 .
however , they spent significantly less , and there was a drop in the number of international visitors to the city .
after a traumatic year , new yorkers are letting their hair down this year , hotel bookings have shown a recovery , but the city still faces huge bills as a result of the devastation of 11 september .
according to a new estimate , the total cost of the terrorist attacks could reach a staggering $ 95bn .
the destruction of the twin towers and surrounding buildings resulted in the loss of 13 million square feet of office space .
between september 2001 and july 2002 , the city lost 83,000 jobs , and there are fears more companies could move out .
" while this devastating event can never be reduced to numbers , it is clear that new york city and the nation will continue to suffer its economic ramifications for years to come , " said city comptroller william thompson .
but on thursday night , new yorkers had a party .
after a traumatic 12 months , they let their hair down .
next week , the city will be in more sombre mood , as it joins with the nation in remembering those who lost their lives on 11 september .
