but on monday , politicians outside the party were lining up to support him .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , called fischer ’ s statement and the subsequent reaction in the press " much ado about nothing . "
schröder , on a state visit to china , accused the german press of overreacting to fischer ’ s statement .
change of position denied " fischer made the position of the german government clear : that we won ’ t take part in a military action , " schröder told reuters .
" therefore we can ’ t speak about a change in german position . "
fischer ’ s own party , a party founded on the principles of pacifism , was divided on monday .
the party 's co-chairs , krista sager and katrin göring-eckhardt , backed fischer and said his statement did not represent a change in the party 's position .
" even if one opposes this war and if one doesn ’ t take part in it , one still can ’ t act completely independantly in the security council , " sager said in an interview with the berliner zeitung .
sager said fischer ’ s statements did not constitute a change of policy .
" fischer just made it clear that he can ’ t speculate about what might happen sometime under certain conditions , " she said .
on sunday , the spd 's spokesman on foreign affairs and acting chairman of the foreign affairs committee in parliament , hans-ulrich klose , said he could n't imagine germany " pulling back " against a collective decision to act against iraq on the security council .
" i ca n't imagine that happening - it would be a setback for germany 's position in the world , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper .
criticism from the greens but vice chair hans-christian ströbele was openly critical .
" we reject war and say no : and we should also do that in the u.n. security council , " ströbele said in a radio interview .
a number of other top green party members - including the leader of the party 's parliamentary group parliamentary and the party boss in the state of lower saxony - also criticized fischer .
social democratic party boss franz müntefering reiterated in a radio interview that germany would not take part in a war .
and as such , he said the government had not changed its stance .
leaders of the opposition christian democrats and free democrats , meanwhile , saw fischer ’ s statement as a change of position and applauded it .
u.s. and israel want germany 's support in recent weeks , it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in case of an emergency .

but on monday , politicians outside the party were lining up to support him .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .
1 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , called fischer ’ s statement and the subsequent reaction in the press " much ado about nothing . "
schröder , on a state visit to china , accused the german press of overreacting to fischer ’ s statement .
change of position denied " fischer made the position of the german government clear : that we won ’ t take part in a military action , " schröder told reuters .
" therefore we can ’ t speak about a change in german position . "
fischer ’ s own party , a party founded on the principles of pacifism , was divided on monday .
the party 's co-chairs , krista sager and katrin göring-eckhardt , backed fischer and said his statement did not represent a change in the party 's position .
" even if one opposes this war and if one doesn ’ t take part in it , one still can ’ t act completely independantly in the security council , " sager said in an interview with the berliner zeitung .
sager said fischer ’ s statements did not constitute a change of policy .
" fischer just made it clear that he can ’ t speculate about what might happen sometime under certain conditions , " she said .
on sunday , the spd 's spokesman on foreign affairs and acting chairman of the foreign affairs committee in parliament , hans-ulrich klose , said he could n't imagine germany " pulling back " against a collective decision to act against iraq on the security council .
" i ca n't imagine that happening - it would be a setback for germany 's position in the world , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper .
criticism from the greens but vice chair hans-christian ströbele was openly critical .
" we reject war and say no : and we should also do that in the u.n. security council , " ströbele said in a radio interview .
a number of other top green party members - including the leader of the party 's parliamentary group parliamentary and the party boss in the state of lower saxony - also criticized fischer .
social democratic party boss franz müntefering reiterated in a radio interview that germany would not take part in a war .
and as such , he said the government had not changed its stance .
leaders of the opposition christian democrats and free democrats , meanwhile , saw fischer ’ s statement as a change of position and applauded it .
u.s. and israel want germany 's support in recent weeks , it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in case of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and the use of military bases in germany .
but the diplomatic situation for the federal government could get trickier come january , when a german representative participates in security council meetings .

but on monday , politicians outside the party were lining up to support him .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , called fischer ’ s statement and the subsequent reaction in the press " much ado about nothing . "
schröder , on a state visit to china , accused the german press of overreacting to fischer ’ s statement .
change of position denied " fischer made the position of the german government clear : that we won ’ t take part in a military action , " schröder told reuters .
" therefore we can ’ t speak about a change in german position . "
fischer ’ s own party , a party founded on the principles of pacifism , was divided on monday .
the party 's co-chairs , krista sager and katrin göring-eckhardt , backed fischer and said his statement did not represent a change in the party 's position .
" even if one opposes this war and if one doesn ’ t take part in it , one still can ’ t act completely independantly in the security council , " sager said in an interview with the berliner zeitung .
sager said fischer ’ s statements did not constitute a change of policy .
" fischer just made it clear that he can ’ t speculate about what might happen sometime under certain conditions , " she said .
on sunday , the spd 's spokesman on foreign affairs and acting chairman of the foreign affairs committee in parliament , hans-ulrich klose , said he could n't imagine germany " pulling back " against a collective decision to act against iraq on the security council .
" i ca n't imagine that happening - it would be a setback for germany 's position in the world , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper .
criticism from the greens but vice chair hans-christian ströbele was openly critical .
" we reject war and say no : and we should also do that in the u.n. security council , " ströbele said in a radio interview .
a number of other top green party members - including the leader of the party 's parliamentary group parliamentary and the party boss in the state of lower saxony - also criticized fischer .
social democratic party boss franz müntefering reiterated in a radio interview that germany would not take part in a war .
and as such , he said the government had not changed its stance .
leaders of the opposition christian democrats and free democrats , meanwhile , saw fischer ’ s statement as a change of position and applauded it .
u.s. and israel want germany 's support in recent weeks , it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in case of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and the use of military bases in germany .

one of the most brutal aspects of their rule was the oppression of women .
under a strict interpretation of islamic law , they were required to dress from head-to-toe in a burka - and , if found wearing nail varnish , could risk having a hand chopped today , breakfast 's graham satchell looks at whether the role of women has changed in the past year : " a year ago , it would this would have been impossible for a woman to learn to drive in kabul - even today its a pretty unusual sight .
hasina has been driving for about a month .
she says : " its important for the whole of women to learn to drive , so they can drive themselves . "
under the taleban , hasina could have had her fingers chopped off for wearing nail varnish .
today she has more freedom - but as we discovered this is a place of extreme contradictions a place where most women are still on the back seat of society - and still wearing the burka , a cloak which covers them from top to toe .
hasina told me : " women do n't feel safe .
they 're afraid of the taleban and they think that if the taleban come back to kabul they will kill them if they take off the burka . "
on afghan television , women are allowed to read the news - but they 're not allowed to sing .
the head of kabul tv says its un-islamic .
for singers like zamzama , this means performances remain behind closed doors .
before the taleban , she released records and even made films in kabul .
she thought she 'd be able to do so again .
she told me she was disappointed and felt hopeless and she implored her country ¿ s leaders to allow her to sing .
for the time being zamzama remains unheard and most of the time unseen .
at the end of the bombing campaign last year , much was made in the west about the improvement in women 's lives .
we were told women were free ; they could throw off their burkas - and girls were going to school .
the reality is more complicated - there remains a culture of fear .
in some parts of the country , girls ' schools have been firebombed i met one afghan woman who had tried to set up a girls ' school in a province outside kabul .
she was told by the local mullah it was n't allowed .
" i think life for women is very difficult in afghanistan now , " tuba told me .
" the people say education is not for girls , just for men .
women are just for working in the house for washing dishes and cleaning the house and cooking - not for education . "
the reason things are n't changing , she told me , is that the mullahs - the men of the old regime - are still running things .
beauty parlours have sprung up all over kabul in the last year - another sign that for some things are getting better .
i found one inside the ministry for women .
in a rare interview , the minister herself told me there 's a simple reason women are not treated the same as men .

cbi scotland chief iain mcmillan said the scottish executive must not put economic growth and job creation behind social policy .
in his new year message , he said the " economy first " message must be " ingrained " into the " very fabric of scottish public life " .
mr mcmillan spoke out as city consultants d & b said the number of businesses going to the wall in scotland rose from 4,519 in 2001 to 4,804 in 2002 - an increase of 6.3 % .
iain mcmillan warned msps off " trivia " however , the rise was below the uk average of 7.2 % in 2002 .
d & b said smaller firms were being forced to close down as orders and lucrative contracts from larger companies dried up .
analyst philip mellor said : " our own economy is slowing down but if you look at the global markets , all doors are closing at the same time .
" the us is still to pick up , germany is almost in recession , france is slowing down and the far eastern markets are all suffering . "
to combat the effects of the bleak global economic situation , mr mcmillan said the cbi wanted to see accelerated investment in the transport infrastructure along with an overhaul of the planning regime .
he said work and enterprise needed to be " embedded " into teacher training , in schools and colleges .
the business leader also urged the scottish parliament to use local fiscal powers to help by setting a competitive business rate .
the manufacturing sector has been struggling mr mcmillan said : " in 2003 , scotland 's political leaders must put the development and success of the scottish economy at the very top of their agendas .
" a useful start was made in 2002 with the scottish executive 's spending allocations being directed more at investment in the economy .
" the executive 's change of policy on business rates and the snp 's withdrawal of their ' penny for scotland ' tax policy were also welcome . "
he added : " but much more needs to be done .
for too many years , too many of scotland 's politicians have been obsessed with the social agenda and legislative trivia , whilst displaying little or no interest in the success of the scottish economy .
" this must change .
scotland will never be entrepreneurial , successful and confident for as long as our political leaders and their parties try to ' out left ' each other and put the social agenda first and the agenda to build sustainable economic growth second . "
the scottish parliament has been told to act meanwhile , the scottish national party has claimed the country has lost between £ 2bn and £ 13bn of public sector spending because of low economic growth under labour .
the party said the economy has grown on average by just 1.4 % annually since labour came to power in 1997 .
it said that compared with a rate of 2.6 % in the uk , 4 % in finland and 8.6 % in ireland during the same five year period .
the snp report said if the scottish economy had grown at the same rate as the uk one as a whole , its gross domestic product would be £ 5bn more , providing an extra £ 2bn of public spending .
the party suggested a growth rate equal to that of ireland would have put scottish gdp £ 33bn higher and delivered a public expenditure boost of £ 13bn .
snp finance spokesman ian wilson claims the figures make a case for financial independence .
" we have to get the job situation in scotland sorted , make sure we 're at a competitive advantage to the rest of the uk , " he said .

exchange rate row china 's economic policy makers are in the midst of a wider reshuffle in the wake of the 16th congress of the chinese communist party in november .
as china 's central banker , mr zhou is likely to face growing calls from japan and the united states for a revaluation of china 's currency , the yuan , to reflect the strength of its fast-growing economy .
the yuan has traded in a narrow band around 8.3 yuan to $ 1 for the last seven years , but japan 's finance minister recently said china 's currency was " too weak " .

china 's cheap exports have been accused by some western economists of exporting deflation , something which has been vigorously denied by commentaries in china 's official press .
mr zhou earned international respect during the asian financial crisis of 1997-98 .
he headed the foreign exchange administration during a period when many asian currencies fell steeply .
china 's authorities resisted pressure to devalue the yuan .
mr zhou led a crackdown on insider trading and sloppy accounting practices during his time as china 's chief stock market regulator .
