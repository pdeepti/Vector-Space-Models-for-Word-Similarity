as an african with a background in political science , he brings an unconventional wisdom to the biggest art job in the world . the decision to appoint okwui enwezor as curator of documenta11 , which opens in kassel today , raised eyebrows among the public and art critics alike .
the tapping of 38-year-old enwezor marked the first time the organization had ever promoted a non-european to the prestigious post .
enwezor impressed the dokumenta commission so much with his dazzling curatorial work at the second johannesburg biennale in 1997 that its leaders broke what was formerly seen as taboo .
enwezor recently quipped to a reporter : " i ca n't really explain why instead of preparing the next documenta , i 'm not working at the u.n. "
the selection of enwezor came at a time when western nations were taking a closer look at artists and critics in africa .
at the recent biennale exhibits in johannesburg and dakar , artists with immense self-confidence and talent knocked loudly on the door , telling the west that their time had come .
in enwezor 's case , that african voice is often very political .
" my approach to art is based on the broadest spectrum .
it 's not simply a question of whether people especially like something , " he says .
" it 's more a question of whether it is something that pulls people in , challenges and even disturbs them .
the work has to take up a critical position that has a direct relationship to its thematic subject . "
born in 1963 and raised in southeastern nigeria , enzewor moved to the united states at the beginning of the 1980s to study literature and political science .
at the time , he also became interested in contemporary art .
in a very short time , he had established himself among insiders as a tremendous expert of contemporary european , american and african art the 20th century .
he was in high demand as a guest speaker at universities and his criticism appeared in numerous art magazines .
with his political science background , an unusual one for the art world , enzewor brings a different perspective to his work as a curator .
in terms of theory , he follows the second-generation modernists , who see globalization as an opportunity rather than a threat .
their ideology is a reaction to the first-generation modernists , whose conviction in the concept of the nation-state has failed .
the second-generation modernists see no conflict in simultaneously living and acting both globally and locally .
in their view , globalization does n't mean centralization , but that there will instead be many centers that coexist with more or less equal status .

as an african with a background in political science , he brings an unconventional wisdom to the biggest art job in the world . the decision to appoint okwui enwezor as curator of documenta11 , which opens in kassel today , raised eyebrows among the public and art critics alike .
the tapping of 38-year-old enwezor marked the first time the organization had ever promoted a non-european to the prestigious post .
enwezor impressed the dokumenta commission so much with his dazzling curatorial work at the second johannesburg biennale in 1997 that its leaders broke what was formerly seen as taboo .
enwezor recently quipped to a reporter : " i ca n't really explain why instead of preparing the next documenta , i 'm not working at the u.n. "
the selection of enwezor came at a time when western nations were taking a closer look at artists and critics in africa .
at the recent biennale exhibits in johannesburg and dakar , artists with immense self-confidence and talent knocked loudly on the door , telling the west that their time had come .
in enwezor 's case , that african voice is often very political .
" my approach to art is based on the broadest spectrum .
it 's not simply a question of whether people especially like something , " he says .
" it 's more a question of whether it is something that pulls people in , challenges and even disturbs them .
the work has to take up a critical position that has a direct relationship to its thematic subject . "
born in 1963 and raised in southeastern nigeria , enzewor moved to the united states at the beginning of the 1980s to study literature and political science .
at the time , he also became interested in contemporary art .
in a very short time , he had established himself among insiders as a tremendous expert of contemporary european , american and african art the 20th century .
he was in high demand as a guest speaker at universities and his criticism appeared in numerous art magazines .
with his political science background , an unusual one for the art world , enzewor brings a different perspective to his work as a curator .
in terms of theory , he follows the second-generation modernists , who see globalization as an opportunity rather than a threat .
their ideology is a reaction to the first-generation modernists , whose conviction in the concept of the nation-state has failed .
the second-generation modernists see no conflict in simultaneously living and acting both globally and locally .
in their view , globalization does n't mean centralization , but that there will instead be many centers that coexist with more or less equal status .

as an african with a background in political science , he brings an unconventional wisdom to the biggest art job in the world . the decision to appoint okwui enwezor as curator of documenta11 , which opens in kassel today , raised eyebrows among the public and art critics alike .
the tapping of 38-year-old enwezor marked the first time the organization had ever promoted a non-european to the prestigious post .
enwezor impressed the dokumenta commission so much with his dazzling curatorial work at the second johannesburg biennale in 1997 that its leaders broke what was formerly seen as taboo .
enwezor recently quipped to a reporter : " i ca n't really explain why instead of preparing the next documenta , i 'm not working at the u.n. "
the selection of enwezor came at a time when western nations were taking a closer look at artists and critics in africa .
at the recent biennale exhibits in johannesburg and dakar , artists with immense self-confidence and talent knocked loudly on the door , telling the west that their time had come .
in enwezor 's case , that african voice is often very political .
" my approach to art is based on the broadest spectrum .
it 's not simply a question of whether people especially like something , " he says .
" it 's more a question of whether it is something that pulls people in , challenges and even disturbs them .
the work has to take up a critical position that has a direct relationship to its thematic subject . "
born in 1963 and raised in southeastern nigeria , enzewor moved to the united states at the beginning of the 1980s to study literature and political science .
at the time , he also became interested in contemporary art .
in a very short time , he had established himself among insiders as a tremendous expert of contemporary european , american and african art the 20th century .
he was in high demand as a guest speaker at universities and his criticism appeared in numerous art magazines .
with his political science background , an unusual one for the art world , enzewor brings a different perspective to his work as a curator .
in terms of theory , he follows the second-generation modernists , who see globalization as an opportunity rather than a threat .
their ideology is a reaction to the first-generation modernists , whose conviction in the concept of the nation-state has failed .
the second-generation modernists see no conflict in simultaneously living and acting both globally and locally .
in their view , globalization does n't mean centralization , but that there will instead be many centers that coexist with more or less equal status .

as an african with a background in political science , he brings an unconventional wisdom to the biggest art job in the world . the decision to appoint okwui enwezor as curator of documenta11 , which opens in kassel today , raised eyebrows among the public and art critics alike .
the tapping of 38-year-old enwezor marked the first time the organization had ever promoted a non-european to the prestigious post .
enwezor impressed the dokumenta commission so much with his dazzling curatorial work at the second johannesburg biennale in 1997 that its leaders broke what was formerly seen as taboo .
enwezor recently quipped to a reporter : " i ca n't really explain why instead of preparing the next documenta , i 'm not working at the u.n. "
the selection of enwezor came at a time when western nations were taking a closer look at artists and critics in africa .
at the recent biennale exhibits in johannesburg and dakar , artists with immense self-confidence and talent knocked loudly on the door , telling the west that their time had come .
in enwezor 's case , that african voice is often very political .
" my approach to art is based on the broadest spectrum .
it 's not simply a question of whether people especially like something , " he says .
" it 's more a question of whether it is something that pulls people in , challenges and even disturbs them .
the work has to take up a critical position that has a direct relationship to its thematic subject . "
born in 1963 and raised in southeastern nigeria , enzewor moved to the united states at the beginning of the 1980s to study literature and political science .
at the time , he also became interested in contemporary art .
in a very short time , he had established himself among insiders as a tremendous expert of contemporary european , american and african art the 20th century .

enwezor impressed the dokumenta commission so much with his dazzling curatorial work at the second johannesburg biennale in 1997 that its leaders broke what was formerly seen as taboo .
enwezor recently quipped to a reporter : " i ca n't really explain why instead of preparing the next documenta , i 'm not working at the u.n. "

born in 1963 and raised in southeastern nigeria , enzewor moved to the united states at the beginning of the 1980s to study literature and political science .
at the time , he also became interested in contemporary art .
in a very short time , he had established himself among insiders as a tremendous expert of contemporary european , american and african art the 20th century .

as an african with a background in political science , he brings an unconventional wisdom to the biggest art job in the world . the decision to appoint okwui enwezor as curator of documenta11 , which opens in kassel today , raised eyebrows among the public and art critics alike .
the tapping of 38-year-old enwezor marked the first time the organization had ever promoted a non-european to the prestigious post .
enwezor impressed the dokumenta commission so much with his dazzling curatorial work at the second johannesburg biennale in 1997 that its leaders broke what was formerly seen as taboo .
enwezor recently quipped to a reporter : " i ca n't really explain why instead of preparing the next documenta , i 'm not working at the u.n. "
the selection of enwezor came at a time when western nations were taking a closer look at artists and critics in africa .
at the recent biennale exhibits in johannesburg and dakar , artists with immense self-confidence and talent knocked loudly on the door , telling the west that their time had come .
in enwezor 's case , that african voice is often very political .
" my approach to art is based on the broadest spectrum .
it 's not simply a question of whether people especially like something , " he says .
" it 's more a question of whether it is something that pulls people in , challenges and even disturbs them .
the work has to take up a critical position that has a direct relationship to its thematic subject . "
born in 1963 and raised in southeastern nigeria , enzewor moved to the united states at the beginning of the 1980s to study literature and political science .
at the time , he also became interested in contemporary art .
in a very short time , he had established himself among insiders as a tremendous expert of contemporary european , american and african art the 20th century .
he was in high demand as a guest speaker at universities and his criticism appeared in numerous art magazines .
with his political science background , an unusual one for the art world , enzewor brings a different perspective to his work as a curator .
in terms of theory , he follows the second-generation modernists , who see globalization as an opportunity rather than a threat .
their ideology is a reaction to the first-generation modernists , whose conviction in the concept of the nation-state has failed .
the second-generation modernists see no conflict in simultaneously living and acting both globally and locally .
in their view , globalization does n't mean centralization , but that there will instead be many centers that coexist with more or less equal status .
consistent with that belief , enwezor tends to cover themes like global communication , the transforming role of nation-states , post-colonialism and migration , and how these themes are influencing contemporary art . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's premier art show set to dazzle long known as the mecca of contemporary art - this year 's documenta 11 in kassel , germany has a distinctly international flavor .

i encourage you to spend your money - tax free mayor michael bloomberg but purchases will only be tax-free for people who shop downtown , where businesses have been hardest hit .
a new study - requested by new york members of the us congress - has found that the 11 september attacks cost the city $ 83bn .
as a result , the city is now facing a large budget gap .
no-tax sunday mr bloomberg announced nine days of tax-free shopping over the next three months .
the first tax-free stretch of three days will start on sunday , to be followed by further three-day tax holidays in july and august .
whatever people - tourists or residents - buy in shops and restaurants in lower manhattan will be free of the 8.25 % sales tax , so long as purchases exceed $ 500 in value .
petrol and tobacco are excluded from the plan , however .
the mayor wants people to back patriotism with spending " from soho to the lower east side , from chinatown to battery park city , i encourage you to spend your money - tax free , " said mr bloomberg .
people have avoided those parts of the city since the attack on the world trade center as downtown has been congested and was heavily polluted by fumes from the burning rubble .
the united states general accounting office says that estimate of the costs of 11 september includes the direct destruction of property as well as indirect losses caused by businesses closing .
even with federal aid and insurance payments , there 's still a budget gap of $ 16bn for the city of new york .
the study - by the investigative arm of congress - is intended to help understand the pattern of financial loss in new york so as to try to focus economic reconstruction efforts .
" stores , restaurants and other establishments throughout lower manhattan experienced a huge loss in customer traffic , and many are still struggling , " said new york state assembly speaker sheldon silver .

just as they had done exactly a year ago , head teachers spent much of their annual conference this week complaining about the chaos being caused in schools by the new as-levels .
it seems this year 's overload is just as bad as it was in the first year of the new examination last year .
how could this be so ?
after all have we not just had a government review of the as-level ?
did it not make recommendations which , we were assured , would iron out the teething problems of the first year ?
the horror stories abounded .
there was the school which is having to stage so many exams this summer that each day it is using up to 19 different rooms as temporary examination halls .
normal activities in the gymnasium and the assembly hall have been suspended for the duration .
another school had as many as 10 different examinations - gcse , as and a-level - to run in a single morning or afternoon session .
inevitably there have been timetable clashes and some students have had to be supervised overnight in teachers ' homes so they can be isolated until they can catch up with the papers they should have taken earlier .
cost of fees there has been another problem : the rising cost of examination fees .
the arrival of the as-level has boosted a typical secondary school 's exam entry fees from around £ 65,000 a year to more like £ 90,000 .
heads say pupils have to sit too many exams as for students , they started taking as-levels as early as 13 may this year .
that is just two terms and a month after they started their sixth form courses .
it is like a horse facing the first hurdle before it has got into its stride and rounded the first bend .
so what is to be done ?
just scrapping as-levels would be a mistake .
there had for a long time been a need to broaden the range of a-level studies in sixth forms in england and wales .
gold standard the traditional three subjects was just too narrow for most young people who will need a wider variety of skills and knowledge in today 's much more varied work-place .
so the principle of the as was good .
but , of course , it was a compromise born out of politicians ' fears about tampering with what lady thatcher had called the " gold standard " of a-levels .
my daughter , currently deep into her gcses , has already had to make her as-level choices .
like most 15 year olds she is still far from clear what really interests her or where her future studies will take her .
she has played safe and plumped for four as-level subjects with which she feels comfortable : history , economics , sport studies and biology .
no foreign language now that is not a very broad range .
if she had been required to take a fifth subject , she would probably have added a foreign language .
david hart and naht delegates want radical change to 14-19 education she would also quite like to have continued with art .
but the as and a-level system does not encourage anyone but the most exceptional student to take five or six subjects .
yet on the continent , baccalaureate-style studies usually encompass six subjects with a requirement to range across the arts , sciences and humanities .
so where have we gone wrong ?
we have managed to over-load our students with examinations : national tests at seven , 11 and 14 , followed by formal qualifications at 16 , 17 and 18 .
yet we still have a very narrow curriculum after 16 .
gcse obstacle the problem is that we do not have a coherent view of education from age 14 to 18 .
instead we have a rigid system from 14 to 16 , followed by an almost unrelated system from 16 to 19 .
and what is the big obstacle ?
why , of course , it is the gcse , taken at age 16 .
in the distant past there was a need for a final set of examinations at the point when the majority of youngsters left full-time education .
but today only a tiny minority leave school , or full-time education , at 16 .
abolishing gcses now , if we could shift , or abolish , the gcse it would be possible to create space for a three-year sixth form .
this would allow time for genuine breadth with students taking five or six subjects .
the as could remain , but would be examined after two years not two terms , and students could drop one or two subjects for their final a-level year .
should gcses be re-thought ?
but what about those students who do not want to continue with academic studies after 16 ?
would we want to deny them a school-leaving qualification ?
that is old-fashioned thinking .
the gcse should be brought forward a year , to the end of year 10 .
after this point students could choose either the three-year as and a-level route or a two or three year vocational route .
the national tests at 14 should also be brought forward a year .
new look timetable so the new secondary school pattern might look like this .
year 7 to settle into the new pattern of secondary schooling .
year 8 should lead to the national tests in english , maths and science .
year 9 and 10 would be a two-year run-up to gcses .
with years 11 , 12 and 13 for vocational or as and a-levels .
this would bring us closer to continental europe where the academic / vocational pathways branch out earlier .
of course , there should be a common core of skills to both pathways , so pupils can move between them or even mix-and-match vocational and academic courses .
there are some problems with all this .
the standard of gcses would have to be lowered if pupils are to take them a year earlier .
wary politicians this would make year-on-year comparisons difficult .
politicians are wary of taking such actions .
the labour government , in particular , does not want to give any ammunition to critics who might say they are being soft on standards by downgrading an important examination .
but , if they believe in broadening sixth form studies for the good of young people and for the health of the economy , it is perhaps a risk worth taking .
schools and parents are , understandably , wary of major upheaval and there is a risk of creating another generation of guinea-pig pupils .
unlike recent educational change , any changes to the gcse should be piloted and evaluated carefully before being implemented .
but to do nothing will leave us with the worst of both worlds : over-tested students who abandon a broad range of subjects too early in their lives .

the incident happened in the dunclug park area of the town at 1440 bst on friday .
the under-car booby trap device exploded as the young officer was getting into his car .
it is thought only the detonator exploded .
the police officer - one of the first batch of recruits to the new police service who recently graduated - is recovering from shock .
detectives have not yet said who they believe was behind the attack .
the area was cordoned off after the explosion and army bomb experts were called to the scene .
a police service spokesman said the officer was off duty at the time .
chief superintendent bob foster said children playing in the area at the time could have been killed or seriously injured by the explosion .
" i can not say at this stage from which source it came but it certainly was the attempted murder of this young student police officer , " he said .
" what he was doing , unlike the people who carried this out , was trying to serve the community and to make it a better place to live .
" it has now been established that what went off was part of a bigger device that did not explode . "

" obviously we need to establish what exactly happened but this is a very worrying development , " said ian paisley junior , who is a member of the northern ireland policing board .

" this was a real and serious attack and i thank god life was not lost . "
ulster unionist assembly member james leslie said he was " shocked and extremely relieved " there were no deaths or serious injuries .
" it would appear from the nature of the device it was intended to kill .
" the conclusion one starts to reach is was this designed to intimidate catholics from joining the police and if that is the case , it is a very serious development indeed . "

the event was held at ruthin jail - the town 's latest tourist attraction - on saturday at 1000 bst .
the eight-member team tried to beat the current champions of the back-to-back challenge from shetland , who shaved the record down to five hours and nine minutes last year .

as part of the competition , 40 teams from across the world took part in similar events in their own countries .

the national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- in the north east of england says the proposal by an australian firm is " practically unworkable " .
new south wales-based bioclip wants to see english sheep farmers inject animals with a special protein which makes them shed their wool .
the move has sparked fears that the art of sheep shearing will disappear in australia .
the way we farm sheep in the north east is totally different to that in australia david heming , nfu however , the nfu says there is no danger of the tradition ending in northumberland and cumbria .
bioclip director john le breton says more than 250,000 australian sheep are already producing fleece by the new method , which involves attaching a net to the animal to collect the fleece .
but david heming , nfu policy adviser , said : " i ca n't see this working in northumberland and cumbria , where we have the bulk of our hill farms .
" i think i can safely say the jobs of 50 or so sheep shearers in the area are safe . "
remove nets mr le breton said the new method is being launched commercially in australia within a matter of weeks and hopefully in the uk later .
but mr heming said : " the way we farm sheep in the north east is totally different to that in australia .
" australia is more open and flatter .
here farmers would have to bring animals in off moors to inject them and fit the nets .
then bring them in again later to remove the nets and harvest the wool .
" there are also lots of rocks and bushes on our hillsides which would damage the nets .

an egyptian lady in her late middle age , she sat upon a stool and smiled at those around her .
she had every reason to be happy .
her workshop , a family business passed on from her husband , was flourishing .
america has already penetrated deep beneath the skin of the arab world in more ways than one her sons hammered and chipped at strips of metal , beating them into ashtrays and hubble-bubble water pipes .
what she did n't know , until i told her , was that the local government grant for her business came from the united states .
she was a living beneficiary of the very country so many egyptians profess to hate , and i think she was quietly horrified .
in egypt it works like this .
each year , the us government gives egypt a grant of around $ 2bn .
two thirds of it is in military aid , making egypt one of the most powerful military forces in the middle east .
but more than $ 0.5bn a year is in economic aid .
through an organisation called usaid , washington has been quietly helping to shore up the tottering egyptian economy .
it funds schools , businesses and a wide range of projects intended to help egyptians lever themselves up out of their grinding poverty .
the us rationale is that a stable , peaceful egypt can be a force for good in the region .
so washington is effectively investing in stability .
subtle influence perhaps naively , many egyptians say they 'd rather do without the money .
they say they want nothing to do with a country they see as the unflinching backer of israel .
but america has already penetrated deep beneath the skin of the arab world in more ways than one .
walk down a street in jeddah , beirut or alexandria and you 'll see an array of fast food outlets .
the golden arches are gaining ground in egypt beside the minarets of riyadh shines the neon glow of burger king .
these days kuwaiti students would rather sip cappuccinos in starbucks than taste the bitter tang of traditional cardamom coffee in a cafe .
switch on saudi tv and you get beverley hills 90210 , rent a video in cairo and you 're offered rocky iv and pearl harbour .
i can think of no more graphic an illustration of this double tug on the hearts and minds of arabs than the demonstration i went to in tripoli last year .
the authorities had bused in thousands of young libyans to the centre of town and handed out anti-western placards .
the organised protest snaked around the ornate boulevards of gaddafi 's capital , railing against the ' injustice ' of the lockerbie verdict .
' down with america ' , ' down with imperialism ' read the banners .
as the procession went past , two libyan demonstrators asked a colleague of mine , an american , where she was from .
when she told them new york , they give her a huge thumbs-up , adding that it was their dream to go and study in america .
the truth is that many young arabs have a curious love-hate relationship with america .
they love its products , hate its policies .
they watch its films , eat its food , wear its baseball caps , even go to its universities .
accusations but mention us policy in the middle east and their faces will darken .
america , they 'll tell you , is biased against muslims , against palestinians , against iraqis , against all arabs .
egypt 's president mubarak walks a fine line this is why the governments of moderate arab states like egypt and jordan find themselves in such an awkward position , each time the tension rises in the middle east .
their economies need us aid and the rulers feel strengthened by their strategic alliance with the world 's only superpower .
but when palestinians are getting killed , arabs in the street want their rulers to cut all ties with israel and possibly even with washington .
and so it was that we found ourselves recently in the middle of a demonstration outside cairo university .
a man with a megaphone went round in circles , carried high on someone 's shoulders .
he cursed israel , he cursed america , he cursed britain .
his saliva flew in streams over the heads of his fellow students .
but never , i noted , did he curse his own government .
ranged against the demonstrators were several lines of riot police .
armed with bamboo canes , tear gas and pump-action shotguns , their job was to prevent the demo breaking out onto the main streets of cairo .
this time the protesters backed down .
they were outnumbered and surrounded .
like every other arab street protest that 's flared up since the start of the palestinian intifada , it looks menacing at close quarters .
but eventually , everyone gets tired and goes home .
real test to come yet egyptians tell me that the real test for their government has yet to come .
if the violence in the palestinian-israeli conflict were to reach a new height and arabs were to die in their hundreds , then the pressure would be on .
moderate arab rulers like president mubarak , king abdullah and perhaps the gulf monarchs too , may have to choose between staying friends with america , and their own survival .
few of today 's rulers have forgotten the fate that befell the shah of iran .

her workshop , a family business passed on from her husband , was flourishing . "
america has already penetrated deep beneath the skin of the arab world in more ways than one " her sons hammered and chipped at strips of metal , beating them into ashtrays and hubble-bubble water pipes .
what she did n't know , until i told her , was that the local government grant for her business came from the united states .
she was a living beneficiary of the very country so many egyptians profess to hate , and i think she was quietly horrified .
in egypt it works like this .
each year , the us government gives egypt a grant of around $ 2bn .
two thirds of it is in military aid , making egypt one of the most powerful military forces in the middle east .
but more than $ 0.5bn a year is in economic aid .
through an organisation called usaid , washington has been quietly helping to shore up the tottering egyptian economy .
it funds schools , businesses and a wide range of projects intended to help egyptians lever themselves up out of their grinding poverty .
the us rationale is that a stable , peaceful egypt can be a force for good in the region .
so washington is effectively investing in stability .
subtle influence perhaps naively , many egyptians say they 'd rather do without the money .
they say they want nothing to do with a country they see as the unflinching backer of israel .
but america has already penetrated deep beneath the skin of the arab world in more ways than one .
walk down a street in jeddah , beirut or alexandria and you 'll see an array of fast food outlets .
beside the minarets of riyadh shines the neon glow of burger king .
these days kuwaiti students would rather sip cappuccinos in starbucks than taste the bitter tang of traditional cardamom coffee in a cafe .
switch on saudi tv and you get beverley hills 90210 , rent a video in cairo and you 're offered rocky iv and pearl harbour .
i can think of no more graphic an illustration of this double tug on the hearts and minds of arabs than the demonstration i went to in tripoli last year .
the authorities had bused in thousands of young libyans to the centre of town and handed out anti-western placards .
the organised protest snaked around the ornate boulevards of gaddafi 's capital , railing against the ' injustice ' of the lockerbie verdict .
' down with america ' , ' down with imperialism ' read the banners .
as the procession went past , two libyan demonstrators asked a colleague of mine , an american , where she was from .
when she told them new york , they give her a huge thumbs-up , adding that it was their dream to go and study in america .
the truth is that many young arabs have a curious love-hate relationship with america .
they love its products , hate its policies .
they watch its films , eat its food , wear its baseball caps , even go to its universities .
accusations but mention us policy in the middle east and their faces will darken .
america , they 'll tell you , is biased against muslims , against palestinians , against iraqis , against all arabs .
this is why the governments of moderate arab states like egypt and jordan find themselves in such an awkward position , each time the tension rises in the middle east .
their economies need us aid and the rulers feel strengthened by their strategic alliance with the world 's only superpower .
but when palestinians are getting killed , arabs in the street want their rulers to cut all ties with israel and possibly even with washington .
and so it was that we found ourselves recently in the middle of a demonstration outside cairo university .
a man with a megaphone went round in circles , carried high on someone 's shoulders .
he cursed israel , he cursed america , he cursed britain .
his saliva flew in streams over the heads of his fellow students .
but never , i noted , did he curse his own government .
ranged against the demonstrators were several lines of riot police .
armed with bamboo canes , tear gas and pump-action shotguns , their job was to prevent the demo breaking out onto the main streets of cairo .
this time the protesters backed down .
they were outnumbered and surrounded .
like every other arab street protest that 's flared up since the start of the palestinian intifada , it looks menacing at close quarters .
but eventually , everyone gets tired and goes home .
real test to come yet egyptians tell me that the real test for their government has yet to come .
if the violence in the palestinian-israeli conflict were to reach a new height and arabs were to die in their hundreds , then the pressure would be on .
moderate arab rulers like president mubarak , king abdullah and perhaps the gulf monarchs too , may have to choose between staying friends with america , and their own survival .
few of today 's rulers have forgotten the fate that befell the shah of iran .

simon weston was among the platoon over 200 people , mainly guards , were attending the service in wrexham 's parish church at 1100 bst on saturday .
event organiser ex-corporal mark pemberton was badly burned during the bombing and 22 out of the 30 men in his platoon were killed .
he said those memories are still clear despite the passing of time .
" the only escape for the guys who got off was to go back through the fire , " said mr pemberton .
it was a lottery , guys who were sitting to the left of you , guys sitting to the right of you , guys opposite you , they died , and you got of former corporal mark pemberton " the one thing that you hold dear is the fact that i do n't think anybody suffered who died - it would have been very quick . "
the sir galahad was bombed on 8 june , 1982 - just six days before argentina surrendered .

guys who were sitting to the left of you , guys sitting to the right of you , guys opposite you - they died , and you got off .
" so you carry guilt , and a great deal of thankfulness that you did get off . "
mr pemberton wants to pay his respects to the victims the argentine invasion led to britain 's biggest deployment of ships , aircraft and men since world war ii , as a taskforce headed 8,000 miles south to recapture the islands .
the conflict cost the lives of 655 argentinian and 255 british servicemen .
but the attack on the landing ships sir galahad and sir tristram has been described as the worst of the 10-week conflict - with 50 men killed and 150 injured .
mr pemberton said the gathering in wrexham would bring together former colleagues have lost touch .
strength and courage " for me , it 'll be to pay my respects to those who did n't come back , " he said .
" for some of these guys , it 'll be the first time that they have ever attended anything like this and had the chance to really discuss it with people who have been through the same thing .
" a lot of the guys have said to me they wo n't talk about it to anyone else .
but obviously when we 're together , they do because we can relate . "
simon weston , who , for many , became a symbol of strength and courage as he overcame his terrible wounds is among 200 at the memorial service .

the wedding party will take place at castle leslie in the village of glaslough , county monaghan on tuesday .
but it is not clear whether the ceremony will happen at the same time .
the couple have refused to comment on mounting speculation they were to wed at the victorian castle next week .
castle leslie usually hosts upmarket weddings but on saturday it emerged wedding invitations had been accepted by prominent irish guests .
preparations continued on saturday within the 1,000-acre grounds where three marquees have been erected for guests .
mobile kitchens , generators , oil tankers , frozen food lorries and special events consultants arrived at the site .
gary roberts , minister at the st salvator 's protestant church in the castle grounds , said interest in the church was unprededented .
no-fly zone a 100-strong private security team has arrived in the irish village from scotland , and was being briefed on friday about arrangements for sunday 's service at the church .
mr roberts , 44 , said that the service would be restricted to " regular parishioners " - apparently to prevent journalists seeing any preparations in the church .
he said about 25 people usually attended the service but about 250 people had asked if they could come this week .
he said : " we would always encourage more people to come to church - but for the right reasons . "
castle owner sir john leslie has dropped hints staff at the castle insisted the heightened activity was for a product launch .
local helicopter leasing companies have said that a no-fly zone has been imposed over the grounds - which would prevent journalists from photographing any preparations .
the village has been besieged by journalists after repeated rumours that the wedding would take place there - either on thursday or next tuesday .
the couple have kept the date and venue of the wedding a tight secret , but sir john leslie , 84 , whose family owns castle leslie , has suggested that the ceremony would take place on tuesday .
security around the castle grounds is tight he said the former beatle had already visited the castle .
" he came here about a year or two ago just as a visitor - we take paying visitors - and he had a look around . "
the first inkling that the village was linked with the wedding rumours came earlier this week , by new york post columnist cindy adams .
ms adams said a reception there would follow a wedding at a nearby church on tuesday .
' going fine ' castle leslie 's owner , sammie leslie , refused to comment .
and there were rumours the couple would marry in new york , or in scotland .
for his part , sir paul has said only that wedding preparations are " going fine " .
sir paul , 59 , met anti-landmines campaigner mills , 34 , three years ago and they became engaged last july .
