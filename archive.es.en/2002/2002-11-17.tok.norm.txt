it has never been easier to own and operate a radio station .
one quick click online reveals hundreds , if not thousands , of music streams that provide beats all day and all night many music fans argue that traditional terrestrial radio in america has reached an all-time low - a small number of huge companies playing the same tiny selection of well-known hits to maximise listenership .
internet radio pioneer air shohat , founder of the digitallyimported website , is fed up with the whole system .
" what happens is that everything which could be considered niche programming can be cut out and you practically have the top 40 all over the place , " he said .
" that way they do n't take the gamble that if somebody does n't like a specific kind of jazz or electronic music they do n't have to worry about this . "
mr shohat 's station plays a number of streams covering trance , hard trance , hard house and eurodance - music that is difficult if impossible to find on the fm dial in new york .
pay to play " there is an argument that if people hear something they 're going to want to buy it , but people are not consuming music that way " john simson , soundexchange thousands of people are listening at any given moment .
no wonder the music industry , represented by soundexchange , has long wanted to collect royalties for the songs being played .
" webcasters think of themselves as being promotional , helping to sell records , " said john simson , executive director of soundexchange .
" record companies are not so sure that it 's promotional and i think the evidence is spotty at best .
" there is the knee-jerk argument that if people hear something they 're going to want to buy it , but more and more people are not consuming music that way .
" if they have a great channel that plays great chicago blues all day long then maybe that 's all they need .
they do n't need a compilation record of chicago blues anymore because anytime they want to hear it they just switch on their computer and go to that station . "
cash crisis the digital millennium copyright act in 1998 formally made webcasting an act of publishing and hence performance fees are due retroactively . "
the costs involved per listener are now about a couple of cents an hour , maybe a penny each for streaming costs and licence fees " kurt hanson , saveinternetradio the librarian of congress initially set the rate at 0.14 cents per song per listener then slashed it in half after an outcry from the internet radio operators .
but almost no webcasters have been handing over the cash .
that is because small time streamers can not afford the fees which in some cases amount to tens of thousands of dollars .
the music industry has had little sympathy claiming that everyone from students to serious music buffs are operating with non-feasible business models , something internet radio enthusiasts deny .
" it 's clearly a sustainable model , it 's exactly the same model as broadcast radio , " said kurt hanson , from the lobby group , saveinternetradio .
" the costs involved per listener are now about a couple of cents an hour , maybe a penny each for streaming costs and licence fees .
radio commercials sell for a penny per commercial per listener .
" so theoretically once advertisers get comfortable with the idea of digital streaming radio being just a different delivery medium then you get revenues .
the idea that it 's not a viable model is silly . "
royalties dispute the likes of yahoo and aol have no problem paying the royalties on a per song per listener basis .
but for digitallyimported it could spell the end of a highly popular , yet unprofitable enterprise because as yet revenues are tiny to non-existent .
" if it 's a fair share of the proceeds then fine , " said mr shohat .
" for example if i could make $ 10,000 a year and they want a fair share of that then by all means .
" but what actually happened is that the rates that were set in the us come out to way over 200 % of what we make a year . "
last month there looked to be a breakthrough .
small webcasters and soundexchange reached an agreement in which the former was to pay the latter between 8 and 12 % of their revenues as royalties .
but as the bill reached the senate for final approval one senator , jesse helms , placed a hold on the legislation , putting the entire future of small online stations in jeopardy .
now everyone is waiting to see if the senate will reconsider the bill and jumpstart a technologically advanced industry that suffers from a lagging legal structure .

the chief police investigator said imam samudra , who is alleged to have links with islamic militant group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- , led both the planning and the execution of the attacks on the sari club and paddy 's bar .
the bombs struck an area frequented by tourists police said details of the suspects emerged from the interrogation of an indonesian man named amrozi - the only person who has so far been arrested in connection with the bombings .
nearly 200 people were killed in the attacks .
at an hour-long news conference on sunday , police told how samudra - described as wearing a hat and often carrying a laptop computer case - remained in bali for four days after the blast observing the police investigations .
" he is also a suspect for the christmas bombing in riau , batam and jakarta , " major general i made mangku pastika said , referring to a string of attacks in 2000 .
police say they now have a detailed picture of how the bombings were planned and carried out , and the various roles of the suspects .
imam samudra - allegedly masterminded the attacks idris - samudra 's deputy , who allegedly arranged accommodation and funding amrozi - bought the explosives , owner of the van used for the biggest bomb ali imron - 30-year-old brother of amrozi , a boarding school teacher and courier for the group dulmatin - second-hand car dealer who allegedly detonated at least one bomb by mobile phone wayan - 35 , who placed the bomb patek - 35 , assistant to samudra .
he said all the suspects were still thought to be in indonesia and would be arrested " as soon as possible " .
but the bbc 's jonathan head in jakarta says there is a good chance that the suspects may not be apprehended , as the indonesian police are thinly stretched .
bomb-maker indonesian officials have previously identified imam samudra as one of the leaders of ji .
amrozi 's appearance was a pr disaster but investigators had not linked the bombing to ji , or to the al-qaeda network with which it is thought to be affiliated .
major general pastika said samudra , a native of sunda on java island , had frequently visited afghanistan and learned to make bombs there .
the revelations come after indonesian police faced strong criticism for carrying out an hour-long public interrogation of a giggling and gloating amrozi before journalists on wednesday .
correspondents say the spectacle only served to erode the credibility of the investigation , while incensing australians who bore the brunt of the deaths among foreign tourists .
on friday , australian prime minister john howard ordered an inquiry into a claim that australia was warned about the attack just before the bombings . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jonathan head " indonesian police say they now have a detailed picture of how the bombings were carried out " full coverage key stories main suspects the bali bomb plot anti-terror laws dead and missing eyewitness reluctant goodbye eerie calm over kuta disbelief at devastation ' a horrible sight ' background indonesia 's militants security dilemma radical cleric most wanted man bali : tourist magnet talking point is indonesia doing enough ?

customs officers were aided by pc ivan armstrong , the blaydon community beat officer and his colleagues .
pc armstrong said : " there was a large amount of cigarettes in each tree .
" i would estimate that there was about 100 tonnes worth of trees in the consignment , so it would not surprise me if there were a million cigarettes there . "
