oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .
with the exception of a brief chilling of relations between germany and china after the bloody quashing of the student democracy movement on tiananmen square in 1989 , relations continue to grow today .
politics as a door opener against the backdrop of visits to china , german politicians often announce major business deals between german and chinese companies .
this close association between business and politics is inevitable , lingeslheim-seilbecke said , noting that many chinese businesses are still controlled by the communist government .
" china 's economy is now , just as before , very much managed by the government , " he said .
" that means it 's important for german industry to maintain good contacts with the responsible authorities . "
politicians , he said , are often there to lend a helping hand .
but even after companies get inside the door , they still face other problems .
a lack of understanding of chinese culture and business practices can often lead to misunderstandings or failed negotiations , said zhou songpo , director of the institute for strategic management at the university of beijing .
a further problem for foreign , as well as domestic , firms doing business in china is the issue of pirated products .
despite strenuous efforts on the part of the chinese government to stamp out forgeries and pirated products , protected innovations from western companies are still often stolen , said jürgen heraeuis , a german businessman from hanau , who is an expert in german-chinese trade . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .
with the exception of a brief chilling of relations between germany and china after the bloody quashing of the student democracy movement on tiananmen square in 1989 , relations continue to grow today .
politics as a door opener against the backdrop of visits to china , german politicians often announce major business deals between german and chinese companies .
this close association between business and politics is inevitable , lingeslheim-seilbecke said , noting that many chinese businesses are still controlled by the communist government .
" china 's economy is now , just as before , very much managed by the government , " he said .
" that means it 's important for german industry to maintain good contacts with the responsible authorities . "
politicians , he said , are often there to lend a helping hand .
but even after companies get inside the door , they still face other problems .
a lack of understanding of chinese culture and business practices can often lead to misunderstandings or failed negotiations , said zhou songpo , director of the institute for strategic management at the university of beijing .
a further problem for foreign , as well as domestic , firms doing business in china is the issue of pirated products .
despite strenuous efforts on the part of the chinese government to stamp out forgeries and pirated products , protected innovations from western companies are still often stolen , said jürgen heraeuis , a german businessman from hanau , who is an expert in german-chinese trade . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "
' black september ' results and news dealt huge blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinsbank suffered during the doom and gloom of september meanwhile , in a month that could by described as ' black september ' by the industry , hypovereinsbank , the second largest in germany , was contributing to the unemployment figures by consigning 9,100 members of staff to the dole .
the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .
also that month , sparkasse berlin added to the general feeling of impending doom in the sector when it announced that it planned to close 21 of its 178 branches .
further losses in the city were reported by the berliner bank , which said it had made it own plans to close 20 of its banking facilities .
with trepidation creeping into the banking community with regard to the worrying state of german banks and with shareholders and customers showing clear signs of no confidence , it seems that the long journey to stability is far from over . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks continue slide into crisis after last year 's announcement that more than 27,000 jobs were in danger at four major german banks , more financial institutions find themselves victims of the slide after more bad news .

news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .
the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .
in addition , a speaker earns a set rate per take , and sometimes , depending on the film 's budget , there are even flat day wages .
the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .
joachim kerzel , the german voice for jack nicholson , is frustrated with the lack of recognition in the business : " we only have our selves to blame , we ’ re not organized .
everyone fights for himself , and the industry can do with us what they want .
we give up our rights for all time , for all the still to be developed media on all the still to be discovered planets . "
but kerzel should take comfort from the fact that the numerous awards ceremonies held around europe go some way to rewarding the faceless stars of cinema ’ s best voices . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips viewers watching a film in germany , italy and spain might notice the lips don ’ t exactly move in synch with the words , and famous actors suddenly have a different voice .
that ’ s because almost all the films are dubbed .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .
with the exception of a brief chilling of relations between germany and china after the bloody quashing of the student democracy movement on tiananmen square in 1989 , relations continue to grow today .
politics as a door opener against the backdrop of visits to china , german politicians often announce major business deals between german and chinese companies .
this close association between business and politics is inevitable , lingeslheim-seilbecke said , noting that many chinese businesses are still controlled by the communist government .
" china 's economy is now , just as before , very much managed by the government , " he said .
" that means it 's important for german industry to maintain good contacts with the responsible authorities . "
politicians , he said , are often there to lend a helping hand .
but even after companies get inside the door , they still face other problems .
a lack of understanding of chinese culture and business practices can often lead to misunderstandings or failed negotiations , said zhou songpo , director of the institute for strategic management at the university of beijing .
a further problem for foreign , as well as domestic , firms doing business in china is the issue of pirated products .
despite strenuous efforts on the part of the chinese government to stamp out forgeries and pirated products , protected innovations from western companies are still often stolen , said jürgen heraeuis , a german businessman from hanau , who is an expert in german-chinese trade . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.10.2002 dark days for german banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dark period continues to shroud the german banking community with forced reductions in workforce numbers , worrying drops in share prices and terminally ill financial results , the light at the end of the tunnel still seems a long way off for german banks . commerzbank 's latest revelation this week that its shares have fallen to their lowest level in over 20 years has added to the already depressive state of the german banking industry .
news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "
' black september ' results and news dealt huge blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinsbank suffered during the doom and gloom of september meanwhile , in a month that could by described as ' black september ' by the industry , hypovereinsbank , the second largest in germany , was contributing to the unemployment figures by consigning 9,100 members of staff to the dole .
the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .
also that month , sparkasse berlin added to the general feeling of impending doom in the sector when it announced that it planned to close 21 of its 178 branches .
further losses in the city were reported by the berliner bank , which said it had made it own plans to close 20 of its banking facilities .
with trepidation creeping into the banking community with regard to the worrying state of german banks and with shareholders and customers showing clear signs of no confidence , it seems that the long journey to stability is far from over . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks continue slide into crisis after last year 's announcement that more than 27,000 jobs were in danger at four major german banks , more financial institutions find themselves victims of the slide after more bad news .
deutsche bank announces further layoffs deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .
that 's in addition to the 9,200 layoffs already announced .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .
the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .
in addition , a speaker earns a set rate per take , and sometimes , depending on the film 's budget , there are even flat day wages .
the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .
joachim kerzel , the german voice for jack nicholson , is frustrated with the lack of recognition in the business : " we only have our selves to blame , we ’ re not organized .
everyone fights for himself , and the industry can do with us what they want .
we give up our rights for all time , for all the still to be developed media on all the still to be discovered planets . "
but kerzel should take comfort from the fact that the numerous awards ceremonies held around europe go some way to rewarding the faceless stars of cinema ’ s best voices . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips viewers watching a film in germany , italy and spain might notice the lips don ’ t exactly move in synch with the words , and famous actors suddenly have a different voice .
that ’ s because almost all the films are dubbed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.10.2002 dark days for german banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dark period continues to shroud the german banking community with forced reductions in workforce numbers , worrying drops in share prices and terminally ill financial results , the light at the end of the tunnel still seems a long way off for german banks . commerzbank 's latest revelation this week that its shares have fallen to their lowest level in over 20 years has added to the already depressive state of the german banking industry .
news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "
' black september ' results and news dealt huge blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinsbank suffered during the doom and gloom of september meanwhile , in a month that could by described as ' black september ' by the industry , hypovereinsbank , the second largest in germany , was contributing to the unemployment figures by consigning 9,100 members of staff to the dole .
the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .
also that month , sparkasse berlin added to the general feeling of impending doom in the sector when it announced that it planned to close 21 of its 178 branches .
further losses in the city were reported by the berliner bank , which said it had made it own plans to close 20 of its banking facilities .
with trepidation creeping into the banking community with regard to the worrying state of german banks and with shareholders and customers showing clear signs of no confidence , it seems that the long journey to stability is far from over . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks continue slide into crisis after last year 's announcement that more than 27,000 jobs were in danger at four major german banks , more financial institutions find themselves victims of the slide after more bad news .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .
the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .
in addition , a speaker earns a set rate per take , and sometimes , depending on the film 's budget , there are even flat day wages .
the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .
joachim kerzel , the german voice for jack nicholson , is frustrated with the lack of recognition in the business : " we only have our selves to blame , we ’ re not organized .
everyone fights for himself , and the industry can do with us what they want .
we give up our rights for all time , for all the still to be developed media on all the still to be discovered planets . "
but kerzel should take comfort from the fact that the numerous awards ceremonies held around europe go some way to rewarding the faceless stars of cinema ’ s best voices . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips viewers watching a film in germany , italy and spain might notice the lips don ’ t exactly move in synch with the words , and famous actors suddenly have a different voice .
that ’ s because almost all the films are dubbed .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .
with the exception of a brief chilling of relations between germany and china after the bloody quashing of the student democracy movement on tiananmen square in 1989 , relations continue to grow today .
politics as a door opener against the backdrop of visits to china , german politicians often announce major business deals between german and chinese companies .
this close association between business and politics is inevitable , lingeslheim-seilbecke said , noting that many chinese businesses are still controlled by the communist government .
" china 's economy is now , just as before , very much managed by the government , " he said .
" that means it 's important for german industry to maintain good contacts with the responsible authorities . "
politicians , he said , are often there to lend a helping hand .
but even after companies get inside the door , they still face other problems .
a lack of understanding of chinese culture and business practices can often lead to misunderstandings or failed negotiations , said zhou songpo , director of the institute for strategic management at the university of beijing .
a further problem for foreign , as well as domestic , firms doing business in china is the issue of pirated products .
despite strenuous efforts on the part of the chinese government to stamp out forgeries and pirated products , protected innovations from western companies are still often stolen , said jürgen heraeuis , a german businessman from hanau , who is an expert in german-chinese trade . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .
the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .
in addition , a speaker earns a set rate per take , and sometimes , depending on the film 's budget , there are even flat day wages .
the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .
joachim kerzel , the german voice for jack nicholson , is frustrated with the lack of recognition in the business : " we only have our selves to blame , we ’ re not organized .
everyone fights for himself , and the industry can do with us what they want .
we give up our rights for all time , for all the still to be developed media on all the still to be discovered planets . "
but kerzel should take comfort from the fact that the numerous awards ceremonies held around europe go some way to rewarding the faceless stars of cinema ’ s best voices . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips viewers watching a film in germany , italy and spain might notice the lips don ’ t exactly move in synch with the words , and famous actors suddenly have a different voice .
that ’ s because almost all the films are dubbed .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .
the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .
in addition , a speaker earns a set rate per take , and sometimes , depending on the film 's budget , there are even flat day wages .
the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .
joachim kerzel , the german voice for jack nicholson , is frustrated with the lack of recognition in the business : " we only have our selves to blame , we ’ re not organized .
everyone fights for himself , and the industry can do with us what they want .
we give up our rights for all time , for all the still to be developed media on all the still to be discovered planets . "
but kerzel should take comfort from the fact that the numerous awards ceremonies held around europe go some way to rewarding the faceless stars of cinema ’ s best voices . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips viewers watching a film in germany , italy and spain might notice the lips don ’ t exactly move in synch with the words , and famous actors suddenly have a different voice .
that ’ s because almost all the films are dubbed .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .
the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .
in addition , a speaker earns a set rate per take , and sometimes , depending on the film 's budget , there are even flat day wages .
the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .
joachim kerzel , the german voice for jack nicholson , is frustrated with the lack of recognition in the business : " we only have our selves to blame , we ’ re not organized .
everyone fights for himself , and the industry can do with us what they want .
we give up our rights for all time , for all the still to be developed media on all the still to be discovered planets . "
but kerzel should take comfort from the fact that the numerous awards ceremonies held around europe go some way to rewarding the faceless stars of cinema ’ s best voices . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips viewers watching a film in germany , italy and spain might notice the lips don ’ t exactly move in synch with the words , and famous actors suddenly have a different voice .
that ’ s because almost all the films are dubbed .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .
with the exception of a brief chilling of relations between germany and china after the bloody quashing of the student democracy movement on tiananmen square in 1989 , relations continue to grow today .
politics as a door opener against the backdrop of visits to china , german politicians often announce major business deals between german and chinese companies .
this close association between business and politics is inevitable , lingeslheim-seilbecke said , noting that many chinese businesses are still controlled by the communist government .
" china 's economy is now , just as before , very much managed by the government , " he said .
" that means it 's important for german industry to maintain good contacts with the responsible authorities . "
politicians , he said , are often there to lend a helping hand .
but even after companies get inside the door , they still face other problems .
a lack of understanding of chinese culture and business practices can often lead to misunderstandings or failed negotiations , said zhou songpo , director of the institute for strategic management at the university of beijing .
a further problem for foreign , as well as domestic , firms doing business in china is the issue of pirated products .
despite strenuous efforts on the part of the chinese government to stamp out forgeries and pirated products , protected innovations from western companies are still often stolen , said jürgen heraeuis , a german businessman from hanau , who is an expert in german-chinese trade . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .
with the exception of a brief chilling of relations between germany and china after the bloody quashing of the student democracy movement on tiananmen square in 1989 , relations continue to grow today .
politics as a door opener against the backdrop of visits to china , german politicians often announce major business deals between german and chinese companies .
this close association between business and politics is inevitable , lingeslheim-seilbecke said , noting that many chinese businesses are still controlled by the communist government .
" china 's economy is now , just as before , very much managed by the government , " he said .
" that means it 's important for german industry to maintain good contacts with the responsible authorities . "
politicians , he said , are often there to lend a helping hand .
but even after companies get inside the door , they still face other problems .
a lack of understanding of chinese culture and business practices can often lead to misunderstandings or failed negotiations , said zhou songpo , director of the institute for strategic management at the university of beijing .
a further problem for foreign , as well as domestic , firms doing business in china is the issue of pirated products .
despite strenuous efforts on the part of the chinese government to stamp out forgeries and pirated products , protected innovations from western companies are still often stolen , said jürgen heraeuis , a german businessman from hanau , who is an expert in german-chinese trade . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.10.2002 dark days for german banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dark period continues to shroud the german banking community with forced reductions in workforce numbers , worrying drops in share prices and terminally ill financial results , the light at the end of the tunnel still seems a long way off for german banks . commerzbank 's latest revelation this week that its shares have fallen to their lowest level in over 20 years has added to the already depressive state of the german banking industry .
news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "
' black september ' results and news dealt huge blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinsbank suffered during the doom and gloom of september meanwhile , in a month that could by described as ' black september ' by the industry , hypovereinsbank , the second largest in germany , was contributing to the unemployment figures by consigning 9,100 members of staff to the dole .
the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .

news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "

the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .

news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .

at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "

the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .
also that month , sparkasse berlin added to the general feeling of impending doom in the sector when it announced that it planned to close 21 of its 178 branches .
further losses in the city were reported by the berliner bank , which said it had made it own plans to close 20 of its banking facilities .
with trepidation creeping into the banking community with regard to the worrying state of german banks and with shareholders and customers showing clear signs of no confidence , it seems that the long journey to stability is far from over . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks continue slide into crisis after last year 's announcement that more than 27,000 jobs were in danger at four major german banks , more financial institutions find themselves victims of the slide after more bad news .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .
the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .
in addition , a speaker earns a set rate per take , and sometimes , depending on the film 's budget , there are even flat day wages .
the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .
joachim kerzel , the german voice for jack nicholson , is frustrated with the lack of recognition in the business : " we only have our selves to blame , we ’ re not organized .
everyone fights for himself , and the industry can do with us what they want .
we give up our rights for all time , for all the still to be developed media on all the still to be discovered planets . "
but kerzel should take comfort from the fact that the numerous awards ceremonies held around europe go some way to rewarding the faceless stars of cinema ’ s best voices . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips viewers watching a film in germany , italy and spain might notice the lips don ’ t exactly move in synch with the words , and famous actors suddenly have a different voice .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .

news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .

" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .

germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .

with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "
' black september ' results and news dealt huge blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinsbank suffered during the doom and gloom of september meanwhile , in a month that could by described as ' black september ' by the industry , hypovereinsbank , the second largest in germany , was contributing to the unemployment figures by consigning 9,100 members of staff to the dole .
the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .
also that month , sparkasse berlin added to the general feeling of impending doom in the sector when it announced that it planned to close 21 of its 178 branches .
further losses in the city were reported by the berliner bank , which said it had made it own plans to close 20 of its banking facilities .
with trepidation creeping into the banking community with regard to the worrying state of german banks and with shareholders and customers showing clear signs of no confidence , it seems that the long journey to stability is far from over . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks continue slide into crisis after last year 's announcement that more than 27,000 jobs were in danger at four major german banks , more financial institutions find themselves victims of the slide after more bad news .
deutsche bank announces further layoffs deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .
that 's in addition to the 9,200 layoffs already announced .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .
the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .
in addition , a speaker earns a set rate per take , and sometimes , depending on the film 's budget , there are even flat day wages .
the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .
joachim kerzel , the german voice for jack nicholson , is frustrated with the lack of recognition in the business : " we only have our selves to blame , we ’ re not organized .
everyone fights for himself , and the industry can do with us what they want .
we give up our rights for all time , for all the still to be developed media on all the still to be discovered planets . "
but kerzel should take comfort from the fact that the numerous awards ceremonies held around europe go some way to rewarding the faceless stars of cinema ’ s best voices . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips viewers watching a film in germany , italy and spain might notice the lips don ’ t exactly move in synch with the words , and famous actors suddenly have a different voice .
that ’ s because almost all the films are dubbed .

at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .

news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .

news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "
' black september ' results and news dealt huge blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinsbank suffered during the doom and gloom of september meanwhile , in a month that could by described as ' black september ' by the industry , hypovereinsbank , the second largest in germany , was contributing to the unemployment figures by consigning 9,100 members of staff to the dole .
the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .
also that month , sparkasse berlin added to the general feeling of impending doom in the sector when it announced that it planned to close 21 of its 178 branches .
further losses in the city were reported by the berliner bank , which said it had made it own plans to close 20 of its banking facilities .
with trepidation creeping into the banking community with regard to the worrying state of german banks and with shareholders and customers showing clear signs of no confidence , it seems that the long journey to stability is far from over . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks continue slide into crisis after last year 's announcement that more than 27,000 jobs were in danger at four major german banks , more financial institutions find themselves victims of the slide after more bad news .
deutsche bank announces further layoffs deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .
with the exception of a brief chilling of relations between germany and china after the bloody quashing of the student democracy movement on tiananmen square in 1989 , relations continue to grow today .
politics as a door opener against the backdrop of visits to china , german politicians often announce major business deals between german and chinese companies .
this close association between business and politics is inevitable , lingeslheim-seilbecke said , noting that many chinese businesses are still controlled by the communist government .
" china 's economy is now , just as before , very much managed by the government , " he said .
" that means it 's important for german industry to maintain good contacts with the responsible authorities . "
politicians , he said , are often there to lend a helping hand .
but even after companies get inside the door , they still face other problems .
a lack of understanding of chinese culture and business practices can often lead to misunderstandings or failed negotiations , said zhou songpo , director of the institute for strategic management at the university of beijing .
a further problem for foreign , as well as domestic , firms doing business in china is the issue of pirated products .
despite strenuous efforts on the part of the chinese government to stamp out forgeries and pirated products , protected innovations from western companies are still often stolen , said jürgen heraeuis , a german businessman from hanau , who is an expert in german-chinese trade . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .
with the exception of a brief chilling of relations between germany and china after the bloody quashing of the student democracy movement on tiananmen square in 1989 , relations continue to grow today .
politics as a door opener against the backdrop of visits to china , german politicians often announce major business deals between german and chinese companies .
this close association between business and politics is inevitable , lingeslheim-seilbecke said , noting that many chinese businesses are still controlled by the communist government .
" china 's economy is now , just as before , very much managed by the government , " he said .
" that means it 's important for german industry to maintain good contacts with the responsible authorities . "
politicians , he said , are often there to lend a helping hand .
but even after companies get inside the door , they still face other problems .
a lack of understanding of chinese culture and business practices can often lead to misunderstandings or failed negotiations , said zhou songpo , director of the institute for strategic management at the university of beijing .
a further problem for foreign , as well as domestic , firms doing business in china is the issue of pirated products .
despite strenuous efforts on the part of the chinese government to stamp out forgeries and pirated products , protected innovations from western companies are still often stolen , said jürgen heraeuis , a german businessman from hanau , who is an expert in german-chinese trade . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .
the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .
in addition , a speaker earns a set rate per take , and sometimes , depending on the film 's budget , there are even flat day wages .
the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .
joachim kerzel , the german voice for jack nicholson , is frustrated with the lack of recognition in the business : " we only have our selves to blame , we ’ re not organized .
everyone fights for himself , and the industry can do with us what they want .
we give up our rights for all time , for all the still to be developed media on all the still to be discovered planets . "

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .

news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "
' black september ' results and news dealt huge blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinsbank suffered during the doom and gloom of september meanwhile , in a month that could by described as ' black september ' by the industry , hypovereinsbank , the second largest in germany , was contributing to the unemployment figures by consigning 9,100 members of staff to the dole .
the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .
also that month , sparkasse berlin added to the general feeling of impending doom in the sector when it announced that it planned to close 21 of its 178 branches .
further losses in the city were reported by the berliner bank , which said it had made it own plans to close 20 of its banking facilities .
with trepidation creeping into the banking community with regard to the worrying state of german banks and with shareholders and customers showing clear signs of no confidence , it seems that the long journey to stability is far from over . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks continue slide into crisis after last year 's announcement that more than 27,000 jobs were in danger at four major german banks , more financial institutions find themselves victims of the slide after more bad news .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .
with the exception of a brief chilling of relations between germany and china after the bloody quashing of the student democracy movement on tiananmen square in 1989 , relations continue to grow today .
politics as a door opener against the backdrop of visits to china , german politicians often announce major business deals between german and chinese companies .
this close association between business and politics is inevitable , lingeslheim-seilbecke said , noting that many chinese businesses are still controlled by the communist government .
" china 's economy is now , just as before , very much managed by the government , " he said .
" that means it 's important for german industry to maintain good contacts with the responsible authorities . "
politicians , he said , are often there to lend a helping hand .
but even after companies get inside the door , they still face other problems .
a lack of understanding of chinese culture and business practices can often lead to misunderstandings or failed negotiations , said zhou songpo , director of the institute for strategic management at the university of beijing .
a further problem for foreign , as well as domestic , firms doing business in china is the issue of pirated products .
despite strenuous efforts on the part of the chinese government to stamp out forgeries and pirated products , protected innovations from western companies are still often stolen , said jürgen heraeuis , a german businessman from hanau , who is an expert in german-chinese trade . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

oct .
11 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and china .
today , germany is china 's largest european trading partner , with hundreds of firms doing business there - from beijing to shenzhen . 1972 was a momentous year for the people 's republic of china .
u.s. president richard nixon 's springtime visit to beijing opened the door for washington 's partners to develop relations with the asian giant , which had been closed to the west for decades .
along with japan and australia , germany officially established diplomatic links half a year later , on oct .
11 .
in the intervening years , germany has advanced to become china 's biggest european trading partner , as well as its biggest european investor .
at times , the bilateral political dialogue has been strained , but these hiccups have been quickly overcome - often thanks to the two countries ' strong economic ties .
the 3.9 billion euro annual direct investment made by german companies in china forms the hinge of the sino-german relationship today .
the chinese have long held german industry in high regard , even after world war ii and the cold war .
during the 19th century , china imported its first trains , telegraph system and other technology products from german companies .
today , that tradition continues to flourish with , for example , the construction of the transrapid magnetic-levitation train by siemens and thyssen-krupps between shanghai and its international airport .
though relations languished during the most intense cold war years , the political climate changed dramatically beginning in the 1960s and especially after nixon 's visit .
from steel mills to transrapids " thirty years ago , the first -lrb- german-made -rrb- steelworks was built under very adventurous conditions in the city of wuhan , " said wolfgang lingelsheim-seibecke , a spokesman for the german economics ministry .
" automobile manufacturers and chemical giants like basf and bayer came soon after .
in recent years , hi-tech companies working in the sectors of information technology , biotechnology and genetics have invested heavily in the country , " lingelsheim-seilbecke said .
more than 1,500 german firms are currently doing business in china .
and with an average of seven percent annual growth - an exception in the international downward economic trend - more companies would like to tap china 's growing spending power and burgeoning consumer market .
with its recent entry into the world trade organization , china is now moving , albeit slowly , to open its markets even more to the west and lower trade tariffs and other barriers - and that could be a boon for german businesses .
" competition will increase significantly and countries that are here will have an advantage , " said lingelsheim-seilbecke .
german companies like manufacturer siemens have been present in china since diplomatic and economic ties were reestablished in 1972 .
but a handful of companies have a much longer history of engagement with the country .
siemens first set up shop in china back in 1872 , establishing itself with the brand name " gateway to the west . "
today , china is the company 's third-largest business partner .
the technology company thyssen-krupp has also been in business in china since 1874 , and annual china sales for the company now surpass the billion euro mark .
both companies , with their long history in china , are now working together on the prestigious transrapid rail project , which is scheduled for completion in january 2003 , after less than two years of construction .
a slow restoration of business ties though trade cooperation between china and germany did n't begin to grow in earnest until after nixon 's visit , german companies struck their own deal with the chinese government as far back as 1957 .
to washington 's dismay , economic links between the countries at the time grew rapidly .
so much so that the u.s. vehemently opposed a german company 's plan in the late 1960s to construct a steel factory in china .
the u.s. feared steel produced from the plant could be used to kill u.s. soldiers fighting in vietnam .
but there was considerable hope for the chinese market after 1972 .
leader deng xiopeng 's vast reforms sparked enthusiasm among german enterprises , though the excitement was dampened by the realization that china 's economy was ruled by cycles of overheating and restrictions dictated by the state .
nonetheless , business relations flourished , with trade between germany and china tripling within a decade .
with the exception of a brief chilling of relations between germany and china after the bloody quashing of the student democracy movement on tiananmen square in 1989 , relations continue to grow today .
politics as a door opener against the backdrop of visits to china , german politicians often announce major business deals between german and chinese companies .
this close association between business and politics is inevitable , lingeslheim-seilbecke said , noting that many chinese businesses are still controlled by the communist government .
" china 's economy is now , just as before , very much managed by the government , " he said .
" that means it 's important for german industry to maintain good contacts with the responsible authorities . "
politicians , he said , are often there to lend a helping hand .
but even after companies get inside the door , they still face other problems .
a lack of understanding of chinese culture and business practices can often lead to misunderstandings or failed negotiations , said zhou songpo , director of the institute for strategic management at the university of beijing .
a further problem for foreign , as well as domestic , firms doing business in china is the issue of pirated products .
despite strenuous efforts on the part of the chinese government to stamp out forgeries and pirated products , protected innovations from western companies are still often stolen , said jürgen heraeuis , a german businessman from hanau , who is an expert in german-chinese trade . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.10.2002 dark days for german banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dark period continues to shroud the german banking community with forced reductions in workforce numbers , worrying drops in share prices and terminally ill financial results , the light at the end of the tunnel still seems a long way off for german banks . commerzbank 's latest revelation this week that its shares have fallen to their lowest level in over 20 years has added to the already depressive state of the german banking industry .
news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "
' black september ' results and news dealt huge blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinsbank suffered during the doom and gloom of september meanwhile , in a month that could by described as ' black september ' by the industry , hypovereinsbank , the second largest in germany , was contributing to the unemployment figures by consigning 9,100 members of staff to the dole .
the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .
also that month , sparkasse berlin added to the general feeling of impending doom in the sector when it announced that it planned to close 21 of its 178 branches .
further losses in the city were reported by the berliner bank , which said it had made it own plans to close 20 of its banking facilities .
with trepidation creeping into the banking community with regard to the worrying state of german banks and with shareholders and customers showing clear signs of no confidence , it seems that the long journey to stability is far from over . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks continue slide into crisis after last year 's announcement that more than 27,000 jobs were in danger at four major german banks , more financial institutions find themselves victims of the slide after more bad news .
deutsche bank announces further layoffs deutsche bank has announced it will cut almost 3,800 jobs .
that 's in addition to the 9,200 layoffs already announced . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .
and experienced voices can earn big bucks .
on average they complete 300 takes a day .
that ’ s about a third of a full-length movie .
the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .
in addition , a speaker earns a set rate per take , and sometimes , depending on the film 's budget , there are even flat day wages .
the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .
joachim kerzel , the german voice for jack nicholson , is frustrated with the lack of recognition in the business : " we only have our selves to blame , we ’ re not organized .

the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...
thomas fritsch won the best male synchro award for lending his dulcet tones to the american production , " second chance , " a story about a man who travels back in time to fort worth , texas on november 22 , 1963 and prevents the assassination of president john f. kennedy .
the best female award was picked up by corinna harfouch for her role as erika kohut in the german adaptation of the french production " the piano teacher , " the film adapted from a novel by the austrian author elfriede jelinek 's .
other top awards went to hilke flickeshildt for her german version of the script for the swedish movie " jalla !
jalla ! " while the best director went to matthias grimm for his work on the german version of the leftfield danish gangster comedy " flickering lights . "
voice actors dubbing for big stars can earn big bucks all the glitz of the award ceremony is well deserved as dubbing is big business , especially in germany , italy and spain where most films have synchronized dialogue .
actors that secure the voice role of a major hollywood star with a regular turnover of films are almost guaranteed work for as long as their on-screen persona continues to make movies .
for many actors working in these countries , performing in the dubbing studio is the only possibility for a steady income .

the basic fee for a speaker varies between 25 and 75 euro a day depending on the quality and qualification of a voice .

the under-appreciated movie stars of european film unfortunately , voice actors seldom find themselves being chased by the gossip hungry paparazzi or mobbed at premieres .
synchronizers hardly ever get recognized for their work .
when the credits roll at the end of a film , the dozens of speakers involved in the production are never named .

the cream of germany 's under-appreciated industry gathered on thursday to pay homage to the stars of movie dubbing at the annual german synchronizing prize . where can dead film stars share the stage at awards ceremonies with the living ?
no , we 're not talking about the voodoo oscars .
it 's the annual german synchronizing prize where the people behind the voices of actors and actresses , past and present , are celebrated by germany 's dubbing fraternity .
the ceremony for the 2002 german synchronizing prize in the brandenburg town of burg played host to hugh grant , penelope cruz , marlon brando and grace kelly among a host of star-studded others .
a rare trick for princess grace , you may say , as the former ms. kelly died in a car crash twenty years ago .
but with all the star names on the guest list , alive or dead , there is not a single hollywood a-list star attending the awards in person .
those with nominations are the mostly unsung heroes and heroines of the silver screen .
they are the voice actors that bring foreign language films to life in their native german tongue .
they are the german alter egos of the cinematic glitterati .
they are the stars of dubbing .
the award ceremony , held on thursday evening , celebrated winners from a number of categories , including best male and female in synchro work , direction and script adaptation .
and the winners are thomas fritsch , corinna harfouch ...

news of the mass sell-off of shares comes after standard and poor 's , the credit rating agency , slashed commerzbank 's credit rating due to fears about the bank 's finances .
with the top german banks shedding jobs like a sinking ship bails water , the news that the country 's third-biggest publicly listed bank has lost the confidence of its shareholders deals yet another blow to the ailing money institutions .
commerzbank shares fell more than 7 per cent to 5.04 euro this week after creditors said that the fall in the value of the bank 's equity reserves would destabilise its financial flexibility .
signs indicate rival banks are reluctant to do business the ebbing confidence of its shareholders was mirrored by that of commerzbank 's competitors in the sector as signs emerged that rival banks were becoming less inclined to do business with commerzbank and the other german banks , especially when it came to dealing with credit derivatives .
commerzbank maintains that relations with traders of derivatives have not been damaged by the news of falling shares and the current instability in the german money market , despite having lost more than 71 per cent of its stock market value in the past six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank says it does n't feel the chill from its competitors .
the bank is also adamant that relations with other banks remain stable in other areas .
in the important inter-bank lending market , where overnight loans from one bank to another take place , commerzbank treasurer rudi duttweiler told reuters news agency that business was continuing as normal .
" i would n't say we 're being treated differently by other banks .
i do n't see us being treated differently on the money market side , " he said .
the slump in the bank 's equity portfolio , the rising cost of maintaining unpaid loans and talk of big trading losses have done little to dispel concerns regarding commerzbank 's operating performance in recent weeks .
it has been a bad year so far for german banks , with radical cost-cutting measures forced upon them by the global economic recession , resulting in drastic reductions in staff numbers .
job cuts at the top german banks shake the industry in june , deutsche bank announced it would cut 13,000 jobs , meaning one in seven current deutsche bank employees would be looking for alternative employment by the end of the year .
at the end of 2001 , deutsche bank employed some 95,000 people .
this year has already seen huge reductions to that number , and by the end of 2003 , the workforce will be significantly lower .
germany ’ s largest bank announced the cuts as part of chairman josef ackermann 's plan to save 2 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- by the end of next year .
other job losses came at the dresdner bank last month after its merger partner , the insurance company allianz , outlined measures to clean up the under performing bank and recoup some of the losses on its own balance sheet attributed to dresdner 's failings .
the 11,000 job cuts were announced as part of the munich insurer ’ s turnaround 2003 strategy which would bring dresdner back into the black and shore up its stock price .
dresdner bank announced losses of 1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2002 , 800 million euro of it in its corporate banking sector .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle last month , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate : " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "
' black september ' results and news dealt huge blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinsbank suffered during the doom and gloom of september meanwhile , in a month that could by described as ' black september ' by the industry , hypovereinsbank , the second largest in germany , was contributing to the unemployment figures by consigning 9,100 members of staff to the dole .
the bank also announced the first operating loss in its history the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets was highlighted by hypovereinsbank 's presentation of its half-yearly report which showed an operating loss of 89 million euro -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
the loss would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for the exceptional gains .
also that month , sparkasse berlin added to the general feeling of impending doom in the sector when it announced that it planned to close 21 of its 178 branches .
further losses in the city were reported by the berliner bank , which said it had made it own plans to close 20 of its banking facilities .
with trepidation creeping into the banking community with regard to the worrying state of german banks and with shareholders and customers showing clear signs of no confidence , it seems that the long journey to stability is far from over . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks continue slide into crisis after last year 's announcement that more than 27,000 jobs were in danger at four major german banks , more financial institutions find themselves victims of the slide after more bad news .

the reserve bank of australia -lrb- rba -rrb- wants to save consumers about a $ 400m -lrb- £ 140m , $ 219m -rrb- by cutting 39 % off inter-bank handling fees on each others credit cards transactions .
the ruling could also set a precedent for european and us regulators to make similar changes .
" what they 're introducing is wrong and sets precedents that we have not found very compatible with the way we think , " visa international chief executive malcolm williamson said .
the company is already fighting anti-trust lawsuits in the us .
smaller rival credit card issuers american express and diners club are exempt from the fee cut .
credit rating reforms to the australian credit card rules would also mean that retailers could charge customers more for purchases on credit , passing on the handling fees to consumers , and issue their own cards .
visa is worried that its card holders might then choose to pay with cash instead and lose customers .
the other main losers from the reforms , the major banks , have ruled out becoming involved in the action .
profit at australia 's four leading banks would be cut by an estimated a $ 130m if the rba succeeds with its reforms .
visa argues that the reserve bank does not have jurisdiction and has acted beyond its powers under the payments systems -lrb- regulation -rrb- act .
the rba and the government have said they are disappointed that visa had decided to take legal action .
the two companies appeared in the federal court in sydney and a six-week trial is expected to be set for may 2003 . watch / listen on this story bbc 's christian mahne " the credit card associations say this will be hugely damaging to their profitability " see also : 19 sep 02 -pipe- business better credit card rights abroad 13 sep 02 -pipe- business credit card debt reaches new heights 11 jun 02 -pipe- business court setback for credit card firms internet links : mastercard visa the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : hacker breaches credit card security job losses escalate at reuters new sec chief pledges tough line oil prices push higher rwanda denies drc plundering overseas sales drive wal-mart congo 's finance minister resigns blair keeps euro options open links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

the military has named both the communist new people 's army -lrb- npa -rrb- and the moro islamic liberation front -lrb- milf -rrb- as key suspects in the blast , which happened in kidapawan city on wednesday .
the bomb was placed by unidentified men under a concrete bench in the terminal , said local police chief superintendent casimiro medes .
one woman and a child were killed at the scene , and the others died in hospital , police said .
the powerful bomb - which police initially said was a grenade - injured about 25 people and damaged two buses .
police have confirmed that six people died , correcting earlier statement that eight had been killed .
denials milf spokesman eid kabalu condemned the attack , saying it was " un-islamic and those responsible should be punished . "
he also said the milf would have nothing to gain from such an attack as the group had a ceasefire agreement with the government .
npa spokesman gregorio rosal , speaking on radio , said his group had nothing to do with the bombing and that the military was trying to falsely label the group as terrorists .
police are working on the theory that the bombers were trying to extort " protection " money from the weena bus company .
the management of the company said it had received several letters demanding money , including one signed by a " suicide bomber team " .
us soldier killed police have been deployed on weena buses for several months following previous bombings , said superintendent medes .
wednesday 's attackers may have left the explosives at the terminal because security was too tight on the buses , he said .
the attack in north cotabato province came a week after a us serviceman was killed in a bomb in the southern city of zamboanga .
the authorities blamed that attack on another muslim group , the abu sayyaf , which is better known for kidnapping for ransom .
the abu sayyaf had warned a week earlier it would mount attacks on civilian , military and us targets to retaliate for the army offensive against muslim rebels in the southern philippines .
the milf is the main group demanding a muslim homeland in the south of the mainly catholic philippines .

the conservative leader , whose keynote address closed the annual gathering , also warned his detractors that he would not waver in his mission to transform his party .
he told tory representatives : " go out there and tell the world - the conservatives are back . "
" this will be remembered as the week when the conservatives began the slow , hard road back to power " iain duncan smith he said his opponents should not underestimate " the determination of the quiet man " .
the tory leader hailed the policies on health , education , housing and crime set out by his frontbench team this week .
he said : " this will be remembered as the week when the conservatives began the slow , hard road back to power . "
he said he would fight for " decency and compassion " , adding : " this week we have rediscovered the courage of our convictions . "
he acknowledged past mistakes by conservative governments , saying that while the economy was transformed under margaret thatcher , the quality of people 's lives had declined in other ways .
he said the party must also learn the lessons of its 1997 election defeat .
and he underlined his quest for " compassionate conservatism " , saying : " we believe that the privileges of the few must be turned into the opportunities of the many .
" above all we believe that to build a better society you must trust people . "
the tory leader attacked labour , saying public services had deteriorated , causing suffering to the poorest and most vulnerable in society .
he said more power should be given to communities to help them shape their lives : " it 's time to start trusting people - because it is only by trusting people that we can make britain work again . "
he stressed the importance of families and of providing support through the voluntary sector - with conservatives " showing compassion without ever feeling that their hearts have to be stitched onto their sleeves " .
mr duncan smith said his experience of redundancy and his military background had made him more determined to achieve his goals .
" i 've known danger and i 've tasted disappointment , " he said .
' quiet man ' " when i say a thing , i mean it .
when i set myself a task , i do it .
" when i settle on a course , i stick to it .
do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man .
" i will continue to do what i believe to be right .
i am not here to waste my time or yours going through the motions of opposition for the next three years . "
" never again can we take the people of britain for granted " iain duncan smith in what is acknowledged as being a vital moment in his one-year-old leadership , he conceded that the previous tory government caused people hurt .
and his message to senior tories sniping at his leadership was to either get on board or get left behind .
without naming names , it appears he was targeting the likes of lord tebbit , kenneth clarke and michael heseltine , whose remarks helped give the conference a troubled start .
hurt and anger mr duncan smith said that in the 1980s " the challenges changed but we did not change to meet those challenges .
" all of us here want to remember the good things we did and there were many .
" but beyond this hall people too often remember the hurt we caused and the anger they felt .
" well , i say this to you - never again .
never again can we take the people of britain for granted .
" until people see that our party has learned the lessons of 1997 , we will go on getting the result of 1997 . "
challenge he added : " the party that i lead will live in the present and prepare for the future .
" so to those who want to re-fight the battles of the past , and to those who want to live in the past , i simply say this - you stay in the past , we are moving on . "
the speech followed the over-riding theme of the week in bournemouth , that the tories must change by broadening their appeal in order to regain power .
that effort began with policies including plans for a new " tough but caring " law and order programme that would tackle crime while offering intensive rehabilitation for young offenders .
power under the tories , nhs hospitals would be given powers to raise and invest their own finances . "
this week we have rediscovered the courage of our convictions " iain duncan smith and parents would be given the power to take their children out of failing inner city schools and set up their own .
there are also plans to extend the " right to buy " to housing association properties .
the policies were published before mr duncan smith 's speech in a document pointing towards the next election manifesto .
the tory leader also backed the government 's approach to iraq , saying action against saddam hussein must come " before it 's too late " .

takeover talks " i do n't think they will give us a high value or that would hurt their bargaining position and give me strength to negotiate , " mr fresco was quoted as saying .
he said the two companies are discussing " endless possibilities " without elaborating but that are thought to involve a possible outright sale .
but mr fresco said there was no discussion of merging fiat auto with gm 's german car unit opel , because of the difficulty of uniting two such troubled companies .
" it is obviously a logical alternative but it 's not on the table at the moment , " he said .
fiat auto comprises the fiat , alfa-romeo and lancia brands , but not ferrari , which is controlled through another fiat unit .

he has since changed the constitution in a way that many people fear is intended to allow him to retain power .
but the president says he has launched comprehensive reforms and that the elections are part of his promise to restore democracy .
sajid iqbal of bbc urdu online looks at the key issues .
who are the main contestants ?
the main players include two leading political groups - the pakistan people 's party of former prime minister benazir bhutto and the pakistan muslim league -lrb- pml-n -rrb- of another ex-prime minister , nawaz sharif .
a host of other groupings are also in the fray , including the pakistan muslim league quaid-i-azam -lrb- pml-q -rrb- which supports the musharraf government .
it comprises dissidents from the nawaz faction of the muslim league .
two other groups are the mutahida majlis-i-amal , which is an alliance of religious parties , and the national alliance , which represents some smaller pro-musharraf political parties -lrb- including former president farooq leghari 's millat party -rrb- .
some regional parties are also expected to play a crucial role in the polls , including the mutahida qaumi movement , which has a mass following in urban areas of sindh province , and the awami national party , with a strong support base in the north-west frontier province .
can everyone take part ?
the musharraf regime introduced several changes in election laws which disbar some of the prominent politicians including mrs bhutto and mr sharif .
the representation of the people 's act includes a clause that prohibits convicted people from taking part in elections .
another law forced several other politicians out of the contest as they did not have a bachelor 's degree , a mandatory qualification .
how are the various representatives elected ?
the election will decide candidates for the national assembly , or lower house , of parliament .
voters will also choose members of the four provincial assemblies .
elections for the senate , or upper house of parliament , are due on 12 november , when members of the provincial assemblies will elect senators for the four provinces .
senators for the federally administered tribal areas will be held through direct elections .
half of the senators will be elected for a three-year period and half for the full term of six years .
what are the main issues ?
there is no single predominant issue .
in urban areas - where only 30 % of the population lives - president musharraf 's reform agenda has been the focus of much of the campaigning .
in rural areas , people are likely to take into account the past performance of candidates .
tribal interests are also expected to influence the poll results significantly .
in the north and in the province of baluchistan , religious parties will exploit anti-us sentiment .
will the voting be free and fair ?
political parties and independent observers have expressed serious doubts about the impartiality of the musharraf regime during the election campaign .
some have alleged it is favouring the plm -lrb- q -rrb- and smaller groups represented in the national alliance .
they say the government machinery and resources were abused by pro-musharraf parties , a charge government officials deny .
are the polls of interest to the international community ?
due to general musharraf 's stated commitment to democracy and his pivotal role in the us-led war against terror , the international community is watching developments in pakistan very closely .
there are as many as 300 election observers from the european union .
president musharraf hopes a successful vote will establish his democratic credentials .
if pro-government parties prevail , it will also help boost his agenda for reform .

the future of two partly-built homes is now in doubt .
former royal navy officer edmund rank got the planning permission , granted by east cambridgeshire district council , overturned .
two new three-bedroom houses next to mr rank 's home in lode road , bottisham , near cambridge , are already nearing completion - but now have no planning consent .
we 've struck a blow for bottisham parish council , whose views were totally ignored by east cambridgeshire edmund rank the council was also ordered to pay mr rank 's £ 11,500 legal costs .
mr rank , 81 , said : " this is a victory for democracy and the people of bottisham .
" we 've struck a blow for bottisham parish council , whose views were totally ignored by east cambridgeshire . "
given permission mr rank was spurred on after discovering that leeds builders planned to demolish the bungalow at number 44 lode road , and build two houses with garages .
mr rank , who served on minesweepers , attempted to scupper the plans by arguing his case at a meeting of east cambridgeshire district council 's planning committee .
however , the building work was given the permission on 14 june .
on thursday , deputy high court judge george bartlett qc ruled the council had acted unlawfully in failing to take into account the environment secretary 's refusal to grant permission for a similar development on the same site in 1989 .
an environment department planning inspector had said at the time the development then proposed for the site would be " cramped " and out of keeping with the rural surroundings .
' obvious relevance ' the judge said the inspector 's conclusions were of " such obvious relevance " that the committee 's failure to take account of them this year made its decision unlawful .
planning committee chairman councilor john abbott said : " the judgment means that the application must be re-determined by the planning committee , which will consider what weight should be attached to the considerations raised by the high court judge .
" we hope to determine the application at the next meeting on 6 november , at which time councillors will be able to consider all the material planning considerations raised by the high court judge before reaching his decision . "
david butler , cambridge-based architect for the developers , said : " this is not over by any means . "

researchers decided the trials had been so successful that it would be unfair to continue giving some patients a dummy version of the pill .
the magnitude of the benefit was so great we felt morally and ethically obliged to stop the trial professor peter sever the tests show that the drug , atorvastatin , was effective on patients who had high blood pressure , but who would not normally be given treatment because their cholesterol levels were not excessively high .
researcher professor peter sever , from imperial college london , told the bbc the trial , carried out on nearly 20,000 patients , was scheduled to run for five years , but had been stopped after three .
he said : " the magnitude of the benefit was so great in terms of reducing strokes and heart attacks that we felt morally and ethically obliged to stop the trial .
" we feel we have an obligation now - if the drug regulatory authorities allow us to - to offer the active drug to those who were previously receiving the dummy tablet . "
lifestyle measures not enough the drug works by reducing levels of cholesterol , the build up of which is a major cause of heart disease .
professor sever said : " the problem in the western world and in britain in particular is that we have poor diets , we have a very high death rate from heart disease and strokes , and lifestyle measures are simply not adequate to reduce that risk . "
the drug , produced by pfizer under the name of lipitor , has been available in the uk for several years , but has not previously been tested on patients who do not have high cholesterol levels .
the trial was designed to compare the effects of newer blood pressure drugs with standard therapies .
in addition , half the patients were given either atorvastatin or a placebo to measure the effects of lowering cholesterol in people who had high blood pressure , but relatively normal cholesterol levels .
among the 5,000 patients who took atorvastatin , the risk of heart attacks or stroke was cut by a third .
up to 50 % of patients with high blood pressure also suffer from high cholesterol , and vice versa .
however , research has shown that patients with high blood pressure are more likely to be treated for their condition than are patients with high cholesterol .
in britain , it is estimated that up to a million people with high cholesterol are either not diagnosed or not meeting their cholesterol targets with treatment .
dr joe feczko , president of worldwide development at pfizer , said : " we believe these results provide evidence that patients with high blood pressure and normal to slight elevation of cholesterol are at increased risk and can benefit from cholesterol lowering medication . "

police believe the incident in rochdale happened when a gang of youths started throwing the fireworks .
on friday it was not clear whether the firework had been thrown directly at the dog , or it had picked one up in its mouth before it exploded .
police warned that unless steps were taken to protect pets there will be more incidents before this year 's bonfire night celebrations .
' nasty injury ' inspector peter jones , of greater manchester police , told bbc gmr it was a " stark warning " .
" even the smallest of fireworks can cause a nasty injury , and particularly they should be kept well away from animals , " he said .
" most people keep their animals indoors in the lead up to bonfire night , but there are still dogs and cats out on the street .
" this incident demonstrates how dangerous fireworks can be . "

many of the more than 1,000 people who died were from casamance as the ferry was the region 's main link to the capital , dakar .
the tragedy came just ahead of the end of school holidays , and many of those who died were the best and brightest of casamance 's students and schoolchildren .
some are already talking about a " lost generation " .
casamance is the most fertile part of senegal but has been plagued by a low-level guerrilla war for the last 20 years .
the movement of democratic casamance forces -lrb- mfdc -rrb- , led by charismatic catholic priest father diamacoune-senghor , wants independence for the region .
food hand-outs while casualty figures are relatively low for an independence war - maybe a few thousand people have been killed in two decades - the tragedy is that what should be a rich region remains mired in poverty .
tens of thousands have had to flee their homes and abandon their fields .
instead of growing rice and selling palm oil , mangos , cashew nuts and other tropical produce , they are reliant on food handouts - if they are lucky .
as the fighting has recently subsided in some parts of the region , those who have returned home have found their villages and fields littered with land mines .
and the once thriving tourist industry on casamance 's beautiful , palm-fringed golden beaches has been decimated by the conflict after attacks on french tourists .
distinct of all the unnatural borders bequeathed by colonialism , the senegal-casamance-gambia frontiers are among the most ridiculous .
in terms of geography , history ethnicity and religion , casamance is quite distinct from the rest of senegal .
it is separated from dakar by the gambia and was a portuguese colony before being bought by the french in 1888 .
casamance ethnic groups jola baynouk balante mandjak mankanya ethnically , casamance is the most diverse region in senegal , with five languages spoken in addition to the three -lrb- wolof , serer , fula -rrb- generally heard further north .
the jola dominate the coastal part of casamance and they form the hard core of the mfdc .
the joola ferry was named after the ethnic group .
overall , senegal is 95 % muslim but in casamance there are roughly as many christians are muslims .
the rebellion was sparked by a feeling that northerners , who dominate the administration , were discriminating against the indigenous population of casamance , the casacais , by granting prime tracts of land to people from the north , where the sahara desert is fast encroaching .
a catholic priest recently told me of virgin forestland being purchased by a northern muslim preacher , who chopped down the trees to plant fields of peanuts .
joint operations ethnically , casamance is similar to neighbouring guinea-bissau and for many years , the mfdc enjoyed tacit support from the authorities in bissau .
this ended in 2000 when kumba yalla was elected president in guinea-bissau and since then fighting has subsided in southern casamance , near the border .
but now the rebel activity has moved further north , near the gambian border .
gambian leader yayha jammeh is jola and many senegalese officials feel that he is now harbouring the rebels .
the rebels are widely believed to finance their arms purchases by growing and selling marijuana , and armed bandits have taken advantage of the lack of security to rob farmers as well as travellers .
and in recent years , the mfdc has split into rival factions , some willing to talk peace , others determined to continue with the armed struggle .
the joola disaster will make life even harder for casacais by further cutting the region off from the rest of the country .
the ferry was by far the most popular way of travelling from casamance to the capital , dakar .
third class tickets cost less than $ 5 and even the wooden benches were more comfortable than sitting in an overcrowded , ramshackle " bush taxi " for eights hours in the searing heat on roads so potholed that many drivers prefer going cross-country .
and just days after the joola capsized , armed men suspected of belonging to the mfdc ambushed a taxi , killing three people .
with the ferry out of action , the direct route unsafe and the plane too expensive for most people , the only option is to go around the gambia - via the south-eastern town of tambacounda - adding 300 km to the trip .
president abdoulaye wade has promised to buy two brand new boats to replace the joola .
but these will not be functioning for some time and even so , following the loss of 1,000 lives , many senegalese may feel wary of travelling by ferry .
