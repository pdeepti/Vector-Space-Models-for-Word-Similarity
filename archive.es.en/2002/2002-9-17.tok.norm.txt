the chough trail , which stretches from anglesey to pembrokeshire will bring twitchers closer to the bird which is also known as the celtic crow . "
the chough trail takes people to areas with visitor facilities or where disturbance to the chough by visitors wo n't be an issue " dave lamcraft , project officer three quarters of the uk 's chough population live in wales and coastal areas provide the best places to view the bird in its natural habitat .
experts say the trail , which opens on tuesday , will provide access to the birds in a controlled manner .
dave lamcraft , chough project officer said : " people do n't normally come into contact with choughs as they live in some of the remotest parts of wales , so this is a great opportunity for people to find out how they can view them safely .
" although choughs can be found elsewhere , the chough trail takes people to areas with visitor facilities or where disturbance to the chough by visitors wo n't be an issue . "
the chough is a member of the crow family and measures 39-40cm long .
it is slightly larger than a jackdaw .
the birds distinguishing features are its distinctive call , glossy black plumage , striking red bill and red legs .
as it flies its broad , deeply fingered wings and square tail are notable features which allow the chough to fly more like a bird of prey than a crow .
the royal society for the protection of birds in wales -lrb- rspb cymru -rrb- has started a chough habitat restoration project to safeguard the population here .
the society wants to encourage farmers and land managers to adopt chough-friendly farming methods .

the force - the first in mainland britain to use a baton round during an incident in february 2002 - has said the impact of the gun was not as effective as had been thought .
bill brereton : not " gung-ho " the round - commonly called a plastic bullet - was used to disarm a knife-wielding man at a domestic disturbance at a house in old colwyn .
the shot left a mark on the man 's abdomen , but he did not drop the knife he was holding and officers still had to go into the house to disarm him .
the matter was immediately referred to the police complaints committee after the man was arrested .
three officers who dealt with the man - who has since been jailed - are to be recommended for bravery awards .
they were called to the house in mor awel , old colwyn , after reports that a 26-year-old woman had been stabbed .
they then received a call from the man saying he had " a chopper " and was going to kill two children in the house .
the baton gun was used after a negotiator failed to persuade the man to give up his weapon .
second round after the old colwyn incident , deputy chief constable bill brereton said the man who was shot was " lucky to be alive " and that baton rounds were preferable to using live ammunition .
but mr brereton has now voiced concerns about the effectiveness of the baton guns .
he said research was needed to see whether a second round could be discharged - or even a multi-discharge weapon used - to disable dangerous people .
but that that should not be seen as a " gung ho " approach , he said but as the force seeking a " less lethal option " to having to fire lead bullets , which could kill .
he also advocated looking into other options , such as the electronic dart system used by some american police forces .

the leaked report , which was prepared by winston roddick , the counsel general , said the procedure was " flawed " and that reforms were needed .
negligence claims are paid from a central pool it also said the body which handles claims on behalf of the nhs - the welsh health legal service - was no longer fit for its purpose .
at present , health authorities and trusts in wales all contribute to a central pool - or " risk pool " which pays out on medical negligence claims .
as the number of succesful claims increases , so does the money needed to pay for them .
this year the authorities and trusts will contribute £ 47m to the pool - an increase of £ 29m on the previous year .
the welsh health legal service - a specialist team of clincial negligence lawyers - deals with claims on behalf of the nhs in wales .
but according to the counsel general , this system needs to be overhauled if it is to become " fairer , swifter and less expensive " .
alternatives the report highlighted weaknesses in the current system as a flawed accountability structure , a lack of senior legal supervision , no system of auditing the quality of work and poor remuneration and career prospects for lawyers and other staff .
poor communication between the welsh health legal service and the welsh risk pool was also highlighted .
a second report explored alternatives to the current system and recommended that the nhs in wales adopted a system called alternative dispute resolution used in other parts of the uk .
it also recommended a fast track scheme to resolve clinical disputes worth between £ 10- £ 25,000 should be piloted .
according to an assembly spokesperson , the recommendations of the report are being considered .
earlier this year , in april , a report by the national audit office suggested the nhs is currently facing a £ 4.4bn legal bill for medical negligence claims - up from £ 2.8bn two years ago .

the chough trail , which stretches from anglesey to pembrokeshire will bring twitchers closer to the bird which is also known as the celtic crow .
the chough trail takes people to areas with visitor facilities or where disturbance to the chough by visitors wo n't be an issue dave lamcraft , project officer three quarters of the uk 's chough population live in wales and coastal areas provide the best places to view the bird in its natural habitat .
experts say the trail , which opens on tuesday , will provide access to the birds in a controlled manner .
dave lamcraft , chough project officer said : " people do n't normally come into contact with choughs as they live in some of the remotest parts of wales , so this is a great opportunity for people to find out how they can view them safely .
" although choughs can be found elsewhere , the chough trail takes people to areas with visitor facilities or where disturbance to the chough by visitors wo n't be an issue . "
the chough is a member of the crow family and measures 39-40cm long .
it is slightly larger than a jackdaw .
the welsh coastline provides the ideal habitat the birds distinguishing features are its distinctive call , glossy black plumage , striking red bill and red legs .
as it flies its broad , deeply fingered wings and square tail are notable features which allow the chough to fly more like a bird of prey than a crow .
the royal society for the protection of birds in wales -lrb- rspb cymru -rrb- has started a chough habitat restoration project to safeguard the population here .
the society wants to encourage farmers and land managers to adopt chough-friendly farming methods .

and as the plane descends into munich airport , siemens ' giant center of excellence crops up on the landscape - a reminder to new arrivals of bavaria 's much-touted transformation from agricultural backwater to high-tech haven .
this is the world which bavarian leader edmund stoiber , the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellory , is frantically trying to sell to the rest of germany before the country goes to the polls next sunday . "
we ca n't change the rest of germany overnight , but we can certainly hope to share some of our successes " thomas goppel stoiber aide his biggest sales pitch : the fact that this staunchly-conservative state has one of the lowest unemployment rates in a country where the number of jobless refuses to go down .
bavarian politicians used to defend fiercely the state 's unique identity within germany .
now mr stoiber and his christian social union , the exclusively bavarian conservative party , are offering a piece to everyone .
" bavaria is like a little germany , " one of mr stoiber 's closest aides , csu secretary-general thomas goppel , tells me .
" all sorts of people live here - foreigners , germans from the north as well as those from the south . "
" if they did n't like the way we did things here they would have left a long time ago , " he says .
" we ca n't change the rest of germany overnight , but we can certainly hope to share some of our successes . "
mr stoiber , whose conservative coalition is neck-and-neck with chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrats in the opinion polls , has had to perform a delicate balancing act in this election campaign .
many non-bavarian germans have some serious reservations about their tradition-conscious , devoutly-catholic southern neighbours .
mr stoiber may not be of the beer-swilling , feathered hat variety , but he has nonetheless been hard at work to persuade the voters of the north that he is simply a politician of the middle ground with a sound economic record during his nine years at the helm in bavaria .
he appointed a single mother to head family policy in a future government , to the consternation of many traditionalists within his party and its senior sister party , the christian democratic union , and has been quiet for most of the campaign on contentious issues like immigration - traditionally a csu favourite .
some observers suggested he could end up alienating his core support while wooing the outside world , but here on his hometurf of wolfratshausen , a very green and leafy village just outside munich , his ardent supporters are not perturbed .
" he has to win the north and that 's why he 's done it , " says emorula goetzinger , a physiotherapist , pushing her bike .
" but he still sticks to the same values . "
" he has done so much good for bavaria , and could do so much for the country if the north would just get over its prejudices and give him a chance .
" mr stoiber would deliver - on the economy , on stricter immigration policies , on everything .
he may not be a good media performer like schroeder , but he is man of actions , which schroeder is not . "
even in munich , the home of a social democrat mayor , no-one denies that mr stoiber has done a good job as bavarian prime minister .
mr stoiber is no free marketeer .
with a combination of state intervention to help out ailing businesses , and subsidies to lure high-tech companies here , he has successfully built on the policies of his predecessors .
" he has done well here , " says alexander laurenzo , an spd supporter .
" and his election campaign has been dominated by his economic successes .
" but i find it hard to trust him - partly because the other election campaigns have been dominated by totally different issues - like immigration - and i 'd say the csu has some very questionable views on that . "
it also remains distinctly unclear whether mr stoiber could pull off his economic policies on the national stage , while remaining committed to cutting public spending and direct taxation .
even in wolfrathausen , there are those who do not want mr stoiber to even start trying to bring bavaria to berlin .
" mr stoiber is very good at being a bavarian politician , and he has done some things very well , " says christina riedl as she made her way to the train station .
" but i want the current government in berlin to have a chance to make good on what they 've started .
i do not want to see our mr stoiber in the chancellor 's chair . "

"
these results show that we are delivering on our programme for long-term growth " tesco chief executive terry leahy the company said on tuesday that pre-tax profits for the six months to august came in at £ 545m -lrb- $ 763m -rrb- , 13.3 % up on the same period one year earlier .
the figure was in line with market expectations , with most analysts forecasting profits growth of 12-14 % .
sales adjusted for new store openings grew by 3.9 % , down from a growth rate of about 7 % this time last year , while total sales climbed 10.6 % on the year to £ 12.7bn.
in the city , tesco shares rose slightly before falling 6.75p lower to 209.25p as investors digested news of the decline in the rate of underlying sales growth .
' normal ' spending the decline reflects slower consumer spending in its main uk market , as well as downward price pressure due to intense retail sector competition .
but tesco downplayed concerns over a full-blown slide in consumer spending , saying that sales are returning to a more ' normal ' level across the industry after posting strong growth in recent years .
" these results show that we are delivering on our programme for long-term growth , " said tesco chief executive terry leahy .
tesco 's latest set of results look set to comfortably maintain its lead over the rest of the british retail sector .
the chain controls an estimated 16 % of the british grocery market , followed in declining order of size by j sainsbury and asda , part of the world 's biggest retail group wal-mart .
overseas jobs boost the company 's recent strong performance stems in part from succesful expansion into continental europe and asia , where the company has been racking up double-digit sales growth in recent months .
tesco is now active in a total of nine countries , with international operations contributing £ 2.3bn in sales .
the supermarket said it planned to create 12,000 new jobs in its overseas division as part of continued expansion plans .
tesco has also moved aggressively into non-food items , selling a wide range of consumer goods such as clothing , cds , dvds and videos .
earlier this year , tesco took over the air miles loyalty scheme from j sainsbury , a move which it claims attracted over 60,000 new customers .

mr blunkett said his remarks should not give anyone offence , although upset could be caused when they were taken out of context . "
the prime minister agrees it is an advantage to children to grow up in a home which is bilingual " downing street he stressed that he had encouraged people to speak english as well as their " mother tongue " at home .
mr blunkett has faced a storm of criticism over the remarks , made in an essay for a new book on british identity in the wake of the 11 september terrorist attacks and last year 's riots in some northern cities .
the home secretary stressed he did not think lack of fluency in english had caused the riots in bradford , burnley and oldham .
' two cultures ' mr blunkett told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " i was making a very simple point , which is if as many as a third of those from asian backgrounds speak no english at home that has an impact . "
it affected both youngsters " and the terrible conflict that exists between one culture and another and , of course , on the matriarchs , the mother and grandmother who often do not speak english at all " , he said .
" i did n't say that we should dictate to anyone what they do in their own home .
" i actually said ' as well as the mother tongue ' , so that we have the english culture and english spoken but we have alongside it the mother tongue and the mother culture .
" now that seems to be eminently reasonable . "
' dangerous territory ' the controversy comes as mr blunkett prepares to be questioned about his asylum and immigration plans by the influential commons home affairs committee .
shadow home secretary oliver letwin accused mr blunkett of straying into " dangerous territory " by " thinking aloud " in this way .
mr letwin told bbc radio 4 's pm that , like mr blunkett , he thought people who wanted to become british citizens should be encouraged to learn english .
but he added : " i think government in general should not spend its time telling people how to behave in their own homes unless there is something going on which is illegal . "
downing street stressed mr blunkett 's remarks were just one part of a 3,000 word essay .
' not dictating to people ' the prime minister 's official spokesman said : " it is not dictating to people what they do .
" it is simply pointing out the advantages to children if english is spoken at home , as well as their mother tongue .
" the prime minister agrees it is an advantage to children to grow up in a home which is bilingual . "
earlier , former minister keith vaz branded mr blunkett 's remarks as the " silliest " he had heard from a home secretary .
he urged the home secretary to spend a night with an asian family .
the labour mp said there was not a single household in his leicester east constituency where english was not spoken .
but in a multi-cultural society people would also speak other languages .
" just to make a blanket statement to say that he would like to see it being spoken based on a survey that i think is completely wrong , is not the best way of helping race relations , " said mr vaz .
