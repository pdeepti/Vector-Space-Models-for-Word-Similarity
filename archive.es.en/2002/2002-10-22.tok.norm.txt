it predicted more dark clouds and only brief periods of sunshine for the economic year ahead . germany 's six leading economic research institutes presented their autumn appraisal on the state of the country 's economy in berlin on tuesday .
the forecasts provide further bad news as germany 's current growth prospects show that previous estimates may have been too optimistic .
according to the combined report of the country 's biggest think tanks , germany 's economic growth is currently a sickly 0.4 percent with a projected figure of growth for 2003 looking marginally better at 1.4 percent .
however , in comparison to the spring forecasts that showed a rate of 0.9 percent at the time and an estimated 2.4 percent for 2003 , germany 's ailing economy shows no sign of benefiting from any quick cure .
in addition to news regarding the slowing economy , research shows that a reduction in germany 's unemployment figures is also some way off .
german unemployment figures set to rise in 2003 according to data from the institutes ' report in the daily business handelsblatt newspaper , projections for 2003 expect the average figure for unemployment to be 9.6 percent .
the figure for the current year is close to 9.5 percent .
the only good news nationally concerns the country 's budget deficit .
as the furore concerning the breaches of the european union 's stability and growth pact continues , germany , as one of the eu 's main offenders , can take heart from research that suggests it can expect a marked reduction next year .
current budget deficit of 3.2 percent to drop next year the autumn report records the budget deficit estimate at 3.2 percent of germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the current year .
it is predicted that the deficit will be reduced to 1.9 percent in 2003 , according to research data in the handelsblatt .
regionally , there has been surprises .
in the former east german states , the domestic product for 2001 stood at 0.1 percent but for the first time for years , industry growth has overtaken that in the western areas of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schroeder hopes the new ' super ministry ' can cure the economy .
with the unemployment rate of about 10 percent , almost non-existent growth and the rising cost of social programs , german chancellor gerhard schroeder has placed immediate pressure on his newly created ' super-ministry ' in charge of monitoring the workforce and the economy .
new ' super ministry ' has difficult time ahead recently appointed ministry boss wolfgang clement has the task of appeasing furious industry chiefs over the admitted 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- budget hole that has pushed the budget deficit up to the 3.2 percent level .
he plans to squeeze more tax revenue out of individuals and businesses to help fill the country 's huge spending gaps .
although the news from the research institutes suggests a declining budget deficit to look forward to , the less than favourable aspects of the report mean that clement and finance minister hans eichel have added burdens to consider on top of their already mammoth tasks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economy loses competitiveness germany is no longer as competitive as it once was .

11 trial opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq 's trial is set to begin on tuesday in this courtroom .
the world 's first full trial of a suspect in the new york terrorist attacks is slated to start in a sealed hamburg courtroom on tuesday morning . the eyes of the world will once again be on germany tuesday as the trial of the first suspect connected to the hamburg terror cell responsible for the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington begins .
officials here are n't taking any chances : streets surrounding hamburg 's higher regional court have been sealed off and extra bullet-proof plexiglass walls installed inside the court room where morrocan-born mounir el motassadeq will be tried .
extra security guards have also been ordered to attend the trial , which is expected to draw 100 journalists from around the world and shed new light on the inner workings of the secretive hamburg al qaeda cell .
3,116 charges motassadeq has been ordered to appear in court to answer to 3,116 charges of accessory to murder for his alleged connections to the terror cell .
the tight-knit group - operating out of hamburg 's harburg neighborhood - was led by mohammed atta , the terrorist believed to have piloted the american airlines flight 11 plane into the north tower of the world trade center .
when he issued motassadeq 's indictment last month , german federal prosecutor kay nehm said the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell .
motassadeq lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorist with his wife and child and maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years , nehm said .
motassadeq 's 89-page indictment stated that he took up membership with the group by summer 1999 at the latest and then " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , his indictment stated .
he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by marwan al shehhi - one of the hijackers aboard united airlines flight 175 , which crashed into the world trade center 's south tower .
nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. nehm also described motassadeq as a " lieutenant in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were taking classes at u.s. flight schools .
" nothing to do with the attacks " german authorities arrested motassadeq in november 2001 , and he remained in investigative custody in wuppertal until a few days ago when he was transferred to hamburg in preparation for the trial .
motassadeq 's lawyer has publicly stated that though his client did know atta personally , he had nothing to do with the planning or execution of the sept .
11 attacks .
as proof , he has requested testimony from ramzi binalshibh the yemeni believed to be the main contact point between the hamburg cell and osama bin laden .
" binalshibh is the only witness who knows el motassadeq , atta - knows all the people - and knows what happened .
at least , the only one in prison , " lawyer hans leistritz told the associated press .
motassadeq has also denied prosecutors ' allegations that money he transferred to other cell members was used in connection with the terrorist attacks and that he spent time in an al qaeda training camp in afghanistan .
more than 160 witnesses are expected to testify at the trial , including motassadeq , who will take the stand in his own defense . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany arrests terrorist helper 13 months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , german authorities have succeeded in arresting a man suspected of assisting the hamburg-based al qaeda cell .

it predicted more dark clouds and only brief periods of sunshine for the economic year ahead . germany 's six leading economic research institutes presented their autumn appraisal on the state of the country 's economy in berlin on tuesday .
the forecasts provide further bad news as germany 's current growth prospects show that previous estimates may have been too optimistic .
according to the combined report of the country 's biggest think tanks , germany 's economic growth is currently a sickly 0.4 percent with a projected figure of growth for 2003 looking marginally better at 1.4 percent .
however , in comparison to the spring forecasts that showed a rate of 0.9 percent at the time and an estimated 2.4 percent for 2003 , germany 's ailing economy shows no sign of benefiting from any quick cure .
in addition to news regarding the slowing economy , research shows that a reduction in germany 's unemployment figures is also some way off .
german unemployment figures set to rise in 2003 according to data from the institutes ' report in the daily business handelsblatt newspaper , projections for 2003 expect the average figure for unemployment to be 9.6 percent .
the figure for the current year is close to 9.5 percent .
the only good news nationally concerns the country 's budget deficit .
as the furore concerning the breaches of the european union 's stability and growth pact continues , germany , as one of the eu 's main offenders , can take heart from research that suggests it can expect a marked reduction next year .
current budget deficit of 3.2 percent to drop next year the autumn report records the budget deficit estimate at 3.2 percent of germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the current year .
it is predicted that the deficit will be reduced to 1.9 percent in 2003 , according to research data in the handelsblatt .
regionally , there has been surprises .
in the former east german states , the domestic product for 2001 stood at 0.1 percent but for the first time for years , industry growth has overtaken that in the western areas of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schroeder hopes the new ' super ministry ' can cure the economy .
with the unemployment rate of about 10 percent , almost non-existent growth and the rising cost of social programs , german chancellor gerhard schroeder has placed immediate pressure on his newly created ' super-ministry ' in charge of monitoring the workforce and the economy .
new ' super ministry ' has difficult time ahead recently appointed ministry boss wolfgang clement has the task of appeasing furious industry chiefs over the admitted 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- budget hole that has pushed the budget deficit up to the 3.2 percent level .
he plans to squeeze more tax revenue out of individuals and businesses to help fill the country 's huge spending gaps .
although the news from the research institutes suggests a declining budget deficit to look forward to , the less than favourable aspects of the report mean that clement and finance minister hans eichel have added burdens to consider on top of their already mammoth tasks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economy loses competitiveness germany is no longer as competitive as it once was .

it predicted more dark clouds and only brief periods of sunshine for the economic year ahead . germany 's six leading economic research institutes presented their autumn appraisal on the state of the country 's economy in berlin on tuesday .
the forecasts provide further bad news as germany 's current growth prospects show that previous estimates may have been too optimistic .
according to the combined report of the country 's biggest think tanks , germany 's economic growth is currently a sickly 0.4 percent with a projected figure of growth for 2003 looking marginally better at 1.4 percent .
however , in comparison to the spring forecasts that showed a rate of 0.9 percent at the time and an estimated 2.4 percent for 2003 , germany 's ailing economy shows no sign of benefiting from any quick cure .
in addition to news regarding the slowing economy , research shows that a reduction in germany 's unemployment figures is also some way off .
german unemployment figures set to rise in 2003 according to data from the institutes ' report in the daily business handelsblatt newspaper , projections for 2003 expect the average figure for unemployment to be 9.6 percent .
the figure for the current year is close to 9.5 percent .
the only good news nationally concerns the country 's budget deficit .
as the furore concerning the breaches of the european union 's stability and growth pact continues , germany , as one of the eu 's main offenders , can take heart from research that suggests it can expect a marked reduction next year .
current budget deficit of 3.2 percent to drop next year the autumn report records the budget deficit estimate at 3.2 percent of germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the current year .
it is predicted that the deficit will be reduced to 1.9 percent in 2003 , according to research data in the handelsblatt .
regionally , there has been surprises .
in the former east german states , the domestic product for 2001 stood at 0.1 percent but for the first time for years , industry growth has overtaken that in the western areas of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schroeder hopes the new ' super ministry ' can cure the economy .
with the unemployment rate of about 10 percent , almost non-existent growth and the rising cost of social programs , german chancellor gerhard schroeder has placed immediate pressure on his newly created ' super-ministry ' in charge of monitoring the workforce and the economy .
new ' super ministry ' has difficult time ahead recently appointed ministry boss wolfgang clement has the task of appeasing furious industry chiefs over the admitted 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- budget hole that has pushed the budget deficit up to the 3.2 percent level .
he plans to squeeze more tax revenue out of individuals and businesses to help fill the country 's huge spending gaps .
although the news from the research institutes suggests a declining budget deficit to look forward to , the less than favourable aspects of the report mean that clement and finance minister hans eichel have added burdens to consider on top of their already mammoth tasks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economy loses competitiveness germany is no longer as competitive as it once was .

11 trial opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq 's trial is set to begin on tuesday in this courtroom .
the world 's first full trial of a suspect in the new york terrorist attacks is slated to start in a sealed hamburg courtroom on tuesday morning . the eyes of the world will once again be on germany tuesday as the trial of the first suspect connected to the hamburg terror cell responsible for the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington begins .
officials here are n't taking any chances : streets surrounding hamburg 's higher regional court have been sealed off and extra bullet-proof plexiglass walls installed inside the court room where morrocan-born mounir el motassadeq will be tried .
extra security guards have also been ordered to attend the trial , which is expected to draw 100 journalists from around the world and shed new light on the inner workings of the secretive hamburg al qaeda cell .
3,116 charges motassadeq has been ordered to appear in court to answer to 3,116 charges of accessory to murder for his alleged connections to the terror cell .
the tight-knit group - operating out of hamburg 's harburg neighborhood - was led by mohammed atta , the terrorist believed to have piloted the american airlines flight 11 plane into the north tower of the world trade center .
when he issued motassadeq 's indictment last month , german federal prosecutor kay nehm said the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell .
motassadeq lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorist with his wife and child and maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years , nehm said .
motassadeq 's 89-page indictment stated that he took up membership with the group by summer 1999 at the latest and then " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , his indictment stated .
he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by marwan al shehhi - one of the hijackers aboard united airlines flight 175 , which crashed into the world trade center 's south tower .
nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. nehm also described motassadeq as a " lieutenant in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were taking classes at u.s. flight schools .
" nothing to do with the attacks " german authorities arrested motassadeq in november 2001 , and he remained in investigative custody in wuppertal until a few days ago when he was transferred to hamburg in preparation for the trial .
motassadeq 's lawyer has publicly stated that though his client did know atta personally , he had nothing to do with the planning or execution of the sept .
11 attacks .
as proof , he has requested testimony from ramzi binalshibh the yemeni believed to be the main contact point between the hamburg cell and osama bin laden .
" binalshibh is the only witness who knows el motassadeq , atta - knows all the people - and knows what happened .
at least , the only one in prison , " lawyer hans leistritz told the associated press .
motassadeq has also denied prosecutors ' allegations that money he transferred to other cell members was used in connection with the terrorist attacks and that he spent time in an al qaeda training camp in afghanistan .
more than 160 witnesses are expected to testify at the trial , including motassadeq , who will take the stand in his own defense . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany arrests terrorist helper 13 months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , german authorities have succeeded in arresting a man suspected of assisting the hamburg-based al qaeda cell .

11 trial opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq 's trial is set to begin on tuesday in this courtroom .
the world 's first full trial of a suspect in the new york terrorist attacks is slated to start in a sealed hamburg courtroom on tuesday morning . the eyes of the world will once again be on germany tuesday as the trial of the first suspect connected to the hamburg terror cell responsible for the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington begins .
officials here are n't taking any chances : streets surrounding hamburg 's higher regional court have been sealed off and extra bullet-proof plexiglass walls installed inside the court room where morrocan-born mounir el motassadeq will be tried .
extra security guards have also been ordered to attend the trial , which is expected to draw 100 journalists from around the world and shed new light on the inner workings of the secretive hamburg al qaeda cell .
3,116 charges motassadeq has been ordered to appear in court to answer to 3,116 charges of accessory to murder for his alleged connections to the terror cell .
the tight-knit group - operating out of hamburg 's harburg neighborhood - was led by mohammed atta , the terrorist believed to have piloted the american airlines flight 11 plane into the north tower of the world trade center .
when he issued motassadeq 's indictment last month , german federal prosecutor kay nehm said the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell .
motassadeq lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorist with his wife and child and maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years , nehm said .
motassadeq 's 89-page indictment stated that he took up membership with the group by summer 1999 at the latest and then " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , his indictment stated .
he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by marwan al shehhi - one of the hijackers aboard united airlines flight 175 , which crashed into the world trade center 's south tower .
nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. nehm also described motassadeq as a " lieutenant in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were taking classes at u.s. flight schools .
" nothing to do with the attacks " german authorities arrested motassadeq in november 2001 , and he remained in investigative custody in wuppertal until a few days ago when he was transferred to hamburg in preparation for the trial .
motassadeq 's lawyer has publicly stated that though his client did know atta personally , he had nothing to do with the planning or execution of the sept .
11 attacks .
as proof , he has requested testimony from ramzi binalshibh the yemeni believed to be the main contact point between the hamburg cell and osama bin laden .
" binalshibh is the only witness who knows el motassadeq , atta - knows all the people - and knows what happened .
at least , the only one in prison , " lawyer hans leistritz told the associated press .
motassadeq has also denied prosecutors ' allegations that money he transferred to other cell members was used in connection with the terrorist attacks and that he spent time in an al qaeda training camp in afghanistan .
more than 160 witnesses are expected to testify at the trial , including motassadeq , who will take the stand in his own defense . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany arrests terrorist helper 13 months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , german authorities have succeeded in arresting a man suspected of assisting the hamburg-based al qaeda cell .

at least , the only one in prison , " lawyer hans leistritz told the associated press .

it predicted more dark clouds and only brief periods of sunshine for the economic year ahead . germany 's six leading economic research institutes presented their autumn appraisal on the state of the country 's economy in berlin on tuesday .

according to the combined report of the country 's biggest think tanks , germany 's economic growth is currently a sickly 0.4 percent with a projected figure of growth for 2003 looking marginally better at 1.4 percent .
however , in comparison to the spring forecasts that showed a rate of 0.9 percent at the time and an estimated 2.4 percent for 2003 , germany 's ailing economy shows no sign of benefiting from any quick cure .

11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington begins .
officials here are n't taking any chances : streets surrounding hamburg 's higher regional court have been sealed off and extra bullet-proof plexiglass walls installed inside the court room where morrocan-born mounir el motassadeq will be tried .
extra security guards have also been ordered to attend the trial , which is expected to draw 100 journalists from around the world and shed new light on the inner workings of the secretive hamburg al qaeda cell .
3,116 charges motassadeq has been ordered to appear in court to answer to 3,116 charges of accessory to murder for his alleged connections to the terror cell .
the tight-knit group - operating out of hamburg 's harburg neighborhood - was led by mohammed atta , the terrorist believed to have piloted the american airlines flight 11 plane into the north tower of the world trade center .
when he issued motassadeq 's indictment last month , german federal prosecutor kay nehm said the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell .
motassadeq lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorist with his wife and child and maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years , nehm said .
motassadeq 's 89-page indictment stated that he took up membership with the group by summer 1999 at the latest and then " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , his indictment stated .
he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by marwan al shehhi - one of the hijackers aboard united airlines flight 175 , which crashed into the world trade center 's south tower .
nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. nehm also described motassadeq as a " lieutenant in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were taking classes at u.s. flight schools .
" nothing to do with the attacks " german authorities arrested motassadeq in november 2001 , and he remained in investigative custody in wuppertal until a few days ago when he was transferred to hamburg in preparation for the trial .
motassadeq 's lawyer has publicly stated that though his client did know atta personally , he had nothing to do with the planning or execution of the sept .
11 attacks .
as proof , he has requested testimony from ramzi binalshibh the yemeni believed to be the main contact point between the hamburg cell and osama bin laden .
" binalshibh is the only witness who knows el motassadeq , atta - knows all the people - and knows what happened .
at least , the only one in prison , " lawyer hans leistritz told the associated press .
motassadeq has also denied prosecutors ' allegations that money he transferred to other cell members was used in connection with the terrorist attacks and that he spent time in an al qaeda training camp in afghanistan .

11 trial opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq 's trial is set to begin on tuesday in this courtroom .
the world 's first full trial of a suspect in the new york terrorist attacks is slated to start in a sealed hamburg courtroom on tuesday morning . the eyes of the world will once again be on germany tuesday as the trial of the first suspect connected to the hamburg terror cell responsible for the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington begins .
officials here are n't taking any chances : streets surrounding hamburg 's higher regional court have been sealed off and extra bullet-proof plexiglass walls installed inside the court room where morrocan-born mounir el motassadeq will be tried .
extra security guards have also been ordered to attend the trial , which is expected to draw 100 journalists from around the world and shed new light on the inner workings of the secretive hamburg al qaeda cell .
3,116 charges motassadeq has been ordered to appear in court to answer to 3,116 charges of accessory to murder for his alleged connections to the terror cell .
the tight-knit group - operating out of hamburg 's harburg neighborhood - was led by mohammed atta , the terrorist believed to have piloted the american airlines flight 11 plane into the north tower of the world trade center .
when he issued motassadeq 's indictment last month , german federal prosecutor kay nehm said the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell .
motassadeq lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorist with his wife and child and maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years , nehm said .
motassadeq 's 89-page indictment stated that he took up membership with the group by summer 1999 at the latest and then " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , his indictment stated .

according to the combined report of the country 's biggest think tanks , germany 's economic growth is currently a sickly 0.4 percent with a projected figure of growth for 2003 looking marginally better at 1.4 percent .

11 trial opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq 's trial is set to begin on tuesday in this courtroom .
the world 's first full trial of a suspect in the new york terrorist attacks is slated to start in a sealed hamburg courtroom on tuesday morning . the eyes of the world will once again be on germany tuesday as the trial of the first suspect connected to the hamburg terror cell responsible for the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington begins .
officials here are n't taking any chances : streets surrounding hamburg 's higher regional court have been sealed off and extra bullet-proof plexiglass walls installed inside the court room where morrocan-born mounir el motassadeq will be tried .
extra security guards have also been ordered to attend the trial , which is expected to draw 100 journalists from around the world and shed new light on the inner workings of the secretive hamburg al qaeda cell .
3,116 charges motassadeq has been ordered to appear in court to answer to 3,116 charges of accessory to murder for his alleged connections to the terror cell .
the tight-knit group - operating out of hamburg 's harburg neighborhood - was led by mohammed atta , the terrorist believed to have piloted the american airlines flight 11 plane into the north tower of the world trade center .
when he issued motassadeq 's indictment last month , german federal prosecutor kay nehm said the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell .
motassadeq lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorist with his wife and child and maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years , nehm said .
motassadeq 's 89-page indictment stated that he took up membership with the group by summer 1999 at the latest and then " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , his indictment stated .
he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by marwan al shehhi - one of the hijackers aboard united airlines flight 175 , which crashed into the world trade center 's south tower .
nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. nehm also described motassadeq as a " lieutenant in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were taking classes at u.s. flight schools .
" nothing to do with the attacks " german authorities arrested motassadeq in november 2001 , and he remained in investigative custody in wuppertal until a few days ago when he was transferred to hamburg in preparation for the trial .
motassadeq 's lawyer has publicly stated that though his client did know atta personally , he had nothing to do with the planning or execution of the sept .
11 attacks .
as proof , he has requested testimony from ramzi binalshibh the yemeni believed to be the main contact point between the hamburg cell and osama bin laden .
" binalshibh is the only witness who knows el motassadeq , atta - knows all the people - and knows what happened .
at least , the only one in prison , " lawyer hans leistritz told the associated press .
motassadeq has also denied prosecutors ' allegations that money he transferred to other cell members was used in connection with the terrorist attacks and that he spent time in an al qaeda training camp in afghanistan .
more than 160 witnesses are expected to testify at the trial , including motassadeq , who will take the stand in his own defense . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany arrests terrorist helper 13 months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , german authorities have succeeded in arresting a man suspected of assisting the hamburg-based al qaeda cell .

he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by marwan al shehhi - one of the hijackers aboard united airlines flight 175 , which crashed into the world trade center 's south tower .
nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. nehm also described motassadeq as a " lieutenant in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were taking classes at u.s. flight schools .
" nothing to do with the attacks " german authorities arrested motassadeq in november 2001 , and he remained in investigative custody in wuppertal until a few days ago when he was transferred to hamburg in preparation for the trial .

it predicted more dark clouds and only brief periods of sunshine for the economic year ahead . germany 's six leading economic research institutes presented their autumn appraisal on the state of the country 's economy in berlin on tuesday .
the forecasts provide further bad news as germany 's current growth prospects show that previous estimates may have been too optimistic .
according to the combined report of the country 's biggest think tanks , germany 's economic growth is currently a sickly 0.4 percent with a projected figure of growth for 2003 looking marginally better at 1.4 percent .
however , in comparison to the spring forecasts that showed a rate of 0.9 percent at the time and an estimated 2.4 percent for 2003 , germany 's ailing economy shows no sign of benefiting from any quick cure .
in addition to news regarding the slowing economy , research shows that a reduction in germany 's unemployment figures is also some way off .

his comments - as the us circulated a new draft resolution to the un security council on iraqi disarmament - also appeared to suggest that saddam hussein might be allowed to stay in power if he complied with the un .
" the stated policy of our government , the previous administration and this administration , is regime change , because we do n't believe he is going to change , " mr bush said following talks with nato secretary general george robertson .
we 're ... making it clear that it 's time to wrap this up richard boucher , us state dept " however , if he were to meet all the conditions of the un , the conditions that i 've described very clearly in terms that everybody can understand , that in itself will signal the regime has changed . "
the bbc 's jon leyne in washington says that mr bush 's remarks sound like a dramatic shift in us policy , however in practice it is more likely to be a tactical change of emphasis designed to reassure other members of the security council while still pursuing a tough new resolution on iraq .
in another development , chief un weapons inspectors hans blix is due in moscow on tuesday for talks with senior officials on resuming weapons inspections .
crisis talks details of the new draft resolution have not yet been released .
us state department spokesman richard boucher said the revised text took into account other countries ' concerns , but he said that the resolution still made clear to iraq that force would be used if it failed to comply with un arms inspectors .
bush : does n't believe saddam will change an earlier proposal ran into difficulties after russia , france and china objected to us and british demands that a new text include an explicit authorisation for the use of force .
as the debate continued , the american under-secretary of state for arms control , john bolton , met russian foreign minister igor ivanov in moscow for talks on the iraq crisis .
but mr boucher said the us was " making it clear that it 's time to wrap this up and would like to see this finished " .
he signalled that america was unlikely to compromise any further to meet the concerns of the other security council members .
chirac said un weapons inspectors must be allowed to do their job france has yet to give an official response to the draft resolution , however france 's un ambassador , jean-david levitte , said on monday that there did not appear to be any hopes for a quick resolution .
and on sunday , french president jacques chirac said he would never support military action against iraq unless un weapons inspectors had first been given the opportunity to resume their work .
bush-putin meeting the head of the international atomic energy agency , dr mohamed al-baradei , told the bbc he was confident iraq would agree to allow inspectors to visit any site they choose when they return to baghdad .
" i think the understanding that iraq now has is that we will not leave any stones unturned , " he said .
he said successful weapons inspections relied on : immediate and unfettered access for inspectors accurate information on which sites to visit the unanimous support of the un security council .
mr bush and russia 's president putin are also expected to discuss iraq when they meet on the sidelines of the asia pacific economic summit in mexico later this week . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's paul adams " there is still a debate going on at the united nations " a senior intelligence official at the pentagon gives a rare interview to the bbc iaea director mohamed el baradei " we are there to deter and detect " full coverage key stories us clerics oppose war saudi war warning iraq polio campaign ' new europe ' hits back analysis blair 's political troubles us and uk regroup blix tiptoes tightrope clickable guide global voices on iraq bbc world service news in arabic audio video inspectors ' report : point by point talking point your views on inspectors ' report see also : 22 oct 02 -pipe- middle east us plans anti-saddam training 21 oct 02 -pipe- americas analysis : dealing with the ' axis ' 18 oct 02 -pipe- middle east us prepares for military option 21 oct 02 -pipe- europe us aims to soothe turkish fears 18 oct 02 -pipe- middle east iraq oil contracts ' to be reviewed ' 20 oct 02 -pipe- middle east iraq amnesty scorned by us 16 oct 02 -pipe- europe chirac denies iraq-al-qaeda link 11 oct 02 -pipe- middle east us ' planning occupation of iraq ' internet links : us department of state united nations iraqi presidency unmovic french foreign ministry international atomic energy agency the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top americas stories now : us draws up second iraq resolution chicago club owners face charges peru 's ex-spy chief on public trial venezuela signs non-violence pact us plays down n korean threat us struggles to clear snow hacker breaches credit card security bolivian cabinet resigns links to more americas stories are at the foot of the page .

under the sudan peace act , president george w. bush will evaluate the peace process to end a bloody 19-year civil war every six months .
sanctions list sudan national broadcasting corporation sudan radio and tv sudan tv coptrade eng and automobile services national cigarettes national electricity posts and telegraphs corporation sudan tea sudanese free zones and markets company sudanese petroleum sugar and distilling industry sfz sudan 's first vice-president ali uthman muhammad taha described the sudan peace act as a declaration of war against peace in sudan , the daily akhbar-al-yawm newspaper reported .
he criticised the law for " rewarding " the opposition sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- for stalling the peace process .
the government of africa 's largest nation signed an agreement with the splm last tuesday to halt fighting during peace talks , after which a ban on aid flights to the south was lifted .
about two million people have been killed and twice as many displaced since the start of the civil in 1983 .

taha attacks act as war on peace the 12 firms were named in a bulletin by the us treasury 's office of foreign assets control -lrb- ofac -rrb- without any explanation , as is standard practice .
the companies were added to an existing list of " specially designated nationals " with whom it is illegal for us citizens to conduct business .
ofac in 2000 virtually admitted it erroneously froze the assets of a sudanese business man , whose factory pharmaceutical factory in sudan was destroyed by 13 us cruise missiles in 1998 , for allegedly making chemical weapons for osama bin laden .
us standards if mr bush finds that khartoum has not negotiated in good faith or " unreasonably interfered with humanitarian efforts " in the south , then washington will move to block multilateral loans to sudan .
the conditions do not apply to the opposition forces in the south of the country .
bush signs the sudan peace act the us will also seek to stop sudan buying weapons with its oil revenues and ask for a un security council arms embargo on the government .
the law will also allow the us government to spend $ 100m a year until 2005 in areas not under the sudanese government 's control and compile a war crimes dossier .
congress would have to pass separate legislation to provide the money .
osama bin laden , who the us holds responsible for the 11 september attacks , lived in sudan for many years .

" the atmosphere was electric , and there was very aggressive bidding both in the room and by telephone , " a spokeswoman for the auction house sotheby 's said .
the 93 lots , which had been expected to fetch more than £ 1m , sold for £ 2.1m.
star item was norfolk-born lord nelson 's sword from the battle of the nile , which reached £ 336,650 - far more than the pre-sale estimate of £ 60-80,000 .
sea captains the sword was believed to have been presented to nelson by sultan selim iii , after the admiral 's victory against the french in 1798 .
close behind was a blood-stained silk purse nelson was carrying when he was killed at the battle of trafalgar , on 21 october 1805 , which went for £ 270,650 .
the purse was part of a collection which had belonged to nelson 's friend alexander davison and had remained hidden from the public for almost two centuries .
the items were found by descendents of his northumberland-born friend davison .
a ' nile sword ' made for sea captains who fought in the battle of the nile also fetched £ 270,650 .
the sword carries an engraving of the destruction of the french flagship l 'orient and has a gilt crocodile-shaped hilt .
the sums were far in excess of their pre-sale estimates .
the nelson museum in great yarmouth failed to buy a letter written by the naval hero .
the museum 's best offer of £ 4,000 was well short of the £ 24,000 winning bid .
sotheby 's jewellery director martyn downer uncovered the collection last year after he visited descendants of alexander davison , nelson 's friend and banker , to research a diamond brooch .
a collection of 72 letters from nelson 's wife frances was acquired by the national maritime museum .
the collection , amassed during nelson 's life by davison is being sold by his descendants .

powergen has warned that the market is " bust " , us firms are deserting the market in droves , and wholesale electricity prices have fallen through the floor .
if you open the market , you 've got to expect that there will be casualties nick holland , energy consultant but the so-called crisis is not worrying customers , nor even the industry regulator .
and analysts say that the troubles are due to markets behaving as free markets are meant to do .
that is because the problem is a simple one - there is just too much electricity for sale .
cash-strapped the national grid company has 68 gigawatts of electricity generating capacity available this winter , but peak demand is only expected to reach 55 gigawatts .
that significant over-capacity of about 22 % has led prices to almost halve from the value of 10 years ago .
many companies have also blamed the structure of the new electricity trading agreement -lrb- neta -rrb- for the sharp fall in prices .
either way , the fall in prices has left many of the generation firms in a tight financial squeeze .
selling out txu europe , part of an american utility , warned that it was facing bankruptcy before selling its business to powergen .
there are also concerns about the solvency of the us-owned aes drax plant , the uk 's largest coal-fired power station .
and british energy , the nuclear generator , is being propped up by a controversial government loan and is facing an uncertain future .
on the supply front , all nine us firms which once owned regional supply businesses have sold out .
survival of the fittest low gas prices and a market system rigged heavily in favour of the generators enticed a wealth of firms into the marketplace .
this is a direct result of a market that for 10 years has been loaded in favour of the generators ofgem a deregulated electricity market appeared to be an attractive new money-maker , and us firms rushed to sign up .
but increased competition and adverse market conditions have caused the newcomers - unable to weather the storm - to jump ship .
" this is a direct result of a market that for 10 years has been loaded in favour of the generators , " said a spokesman from ofgem , the industry regulator .
" if you open the market , you 've got to expect that there will be casualties , " said nick holland , an energy consultant at john hall associates .
boom and bust many experts have also said that the mass exodus is an expected pattern of consolidation after the post-liberalisation boom days .
powergen 's chairman ed wallis predicted years ago that the industry would consolidate down to four or five key players who both generated electricity and supplied the regional networks .
" it 's akin to the dot.com scenario when loads of firms rushed to be a part of the latest craze without waiting to work out how they would make money , " said stephen hall , an industry expert at energy argus .
and the enron affair has also played its part .
the us utilities - facing weak shareholder confidence on the home front - have been unable to maintain money-draining arms overseas .
in search of a martyr while the consolidation is now well underway , the problem of over-capacity still needs to be solved .
someone somewhere is going to have to shut down all or part of its generation business .
many fingers are already pointing at british energy since the firm is already close to bankruptcy due to expensive commitments to process nuclear waste .
but the british government may chose to intervene as nuclear generation helps meet environmental commitments .
on the rise other solutions are also being mooted .
stuart gray , wood mckenzie 's power expert , suspects that powergen has bought up txu 's plants in order to remove them from the supply equation and boost prices again .
meanwhile , wholesale electricity prices are already starting to rise on the expectations that a martyr will soon be found .
the rebound is yet more proof that this " crisis " is a simple case of the forces of supply and demand at work .
and the open market is simply fulfilling its purpose .
