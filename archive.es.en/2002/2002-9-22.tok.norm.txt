" anyone who has watched the past decade has seen the iraqi government defy some 16 un resolutions and change their position depending on what they though was tactically advantageous to them , " mr rumsfeld told the cnn .
on saturday , iraq said it would ignore any new resolutions adopted by the un security council .
the announcement , which followed a meeting involving president saddam hussein and senior officials , accused the us of trying to push a " new , bad " resolution .
us president george w bush is calling for the security council to lay out specific consequences for iraq if it fails to comply fully with existing resolutions on weapons inspections . "
i am not saying there is no plan on his desk " white house spokesman ari fleischer the american general who would lead a us military campaign against iraq said on saturday his forces were ready for war .
" we are prepared to do whatever we are asked to do , " general tommy franks said on a visit to troops stationed in kuwait .
general franks insisted mr bush had not taken a final decision on military action but senior us officials admitted that mr bush had now been given a detailed set of military options .
" i am not saying there is no plan on his desk , " white house spokesman ari fleischer said .
council split last monday , iraq agreed to allow the unconditional return of international weapons inspectors who left the country four years ago .
the bbc 's caroline hawley in baghdad says iraq made it clear it expected the un in return to guarantee it would not face attack if they did come back , and that it also wanted light at the end of the tunnel over sanctions .
" iraq announced that it will not co-operate with a new resolution which is different to what was agreed with the -lrb- un -rrb- secretary general -lrb- kofi annan -rrb- , " saturday 's statement said .
" american officials are trying to issue or pass a new , bad resolution by the security council , " it said .
the new iraqi stand was decided at a meeting between saddam hussein and senior officials , including foreign minister naji sabri who has just returned from the un .
the five permanent members of the security council have been split over the us demand for a resolution , with the uk backing mr bush , russia and china opposing a new resolution and france expressing strong reservations .
the us has dismissed the iraqi offer to resume inspections as a ploy and mr bush has asked congress to authorise measures against iraq even if the un refuses to do so .
war plans us military plans for action against iraq have already been worked out in some detail , us officials have said .
highly classified plans were presented to mr bush in early september , just days before his speech to the un general assembly demanding its support , the new york times said , quoting unnamed officials .
they told the paper any attack would start with heavy air bombardments by b2 bombers aimed at destroying air defences , command and control headquarters and communications structures , leaving president saddam isolated in baghdad .
meanwhile , tens of thousands of marines and soldiers would launch an assault from kuwait and possibly other countries .
the planning document also gives the number of ground troops , combat aircraft and aircraft carrier battle groups required , officials told the new york times .

council split last monday , iraq agreed to allow the unconditional return of international weapons inspectors who left the country four years ago .
the us aims to isolate saddam hussein in baghdad the bbc 's caroline hawley in baghdad says iraq made it clear it expected the un in return to guarantee it would not face attack if they did come back , and that it also wanted light at the end of the tunnel over sanctions .
" iraq announced that it will not co-operate with a new resolution which is different to what was agreed with the -lrb- un -rrb- secretary general -lrb- kofi annan -rrb- , " saturday 's statement said .
" american officials are trying to issue or pass a new , bad resolution by the security council , " it said .
the new iraqi stand was decided at a meeting between saddam hussein and senior officials , including foreign minister naji sabri who has just returned from the un .
the five permanent members of the security council have been split over the us demand for a resolution , with the uk backing mr bush , russia and china opposing a new resolution and france expressing strong reservations . : who backs war ?
where key nations stand on iraq the us has dismissed the iraqi offer to resume inspections as a ploy and mr bush has asked congress to authorise measures against iraq even if the un refuses to do so .
war plans us military plans for action against iraq have already been worked out in some detail , us officials have said .
bush has already been given a detailed military plan highly classified plans were presented to mr bush in early september , just days before his speech to the un general assembly demanding its support , the new york times said , quoting unnamed officials .
they told the paper any attack would start with heavy air bombardments by b2 bombers aimed at destroying air defences , command and control headquarters and communications structures , leaving president saddam isolated in baghdad .
meanwhile , tens of thousands of marines and soldiers would launch an assault from kuwait and possibly other countries .

like almost every organisation in the us , the massachusetts institute of technology spent the late 1990s struggling with the question of how to take advantage of the internet .
many other colleges launched online degree courses aimed at anyone with a modem and a big wallet .
but mit has taken a completely different direction with a project called opencourseware -lrb- ocw -rrb- that could stop the trend of commercialising online education dead in its tracks .
the first group of courses are set to be published on the internet on 30 september , including subjects like anthropology , biology , chemistry and computer science .
education revolution " i genuinely think there was an ' a-ha ' moment when they said our mission was actually to enhance education , " said anne margulies , executive director of ocw .
" our hope and aspiration is that by setting an example , other universities will also put their valued materials on the internet professor dick yue , mit " why do n't we , instead of trying to sell our knowledge over the internet , just give it away . "
over the next 10 years , mit will move all its existing coursework on to the internet .
there will be no online degrees for sale , however .
instead , it will offer thousands of pages of information , available to anyone around the globe at no cost , as well as hours and hours of streaming video lectures , seminars and experiments .
this is just the tip of the iceberg .
mit wants to start nothing short of a global revolution in education .
" our hope and aspiration is that by setting an example , other universities will also put their valued materials on the internet and thereby make a truly profound and fundamental impact on learning and education worldwide , " said mit 's professor dick yue .
mit admits that getting opencourseware ready for its internet debut has been a huge challenge .
staff have spent months clearing up complex copyright issues and designing software tools that will enable hundreds of faculty members to upload their daily lecture notes and video clips directly onto the website .
free for all at a time when many internet administrators in america have been removing any technological resources that could be of use to terrorists , mit will not be sifting online information .
there is no revenue objective for ocw , ever .
it will always be free anne margulies , ocw " with regard to censoring or filtering what might be construed as sensitive materials , at this time we are not doing any of that kind of censorship , " said laura koller , ocw project manager .
" as we go forward through our pilot project those issues will certainly come up again and be revisited by faculty , administrators and so forth .
but at this time we 're publishing all the materials we get . "
most websites now have abandoned the idea of offering totally free content .
the trick is to lure you to the site with good intentions , then start entangling you in charges .
mit are offering an eternal promise , rare these days on the world wide web .
" there is no revenue objective for ocw , ever .
it will always be free , " insisted ms margulies .
mit staff point out that if this initiative is successful , and other institutions follow , it will put the net back on track towards its original goal of sharing information and knowledge around the world , rather than selling cds and t-shirts .

he is also wanted in numerous cases of murder , extortion and kidnapping .
mr advani gave assurances that abu salem would not face the death penalty in india - capital punishment is banned by european union countries .
" in this case , it is possible and indian law permits that the necessary assurance may be given to the concerned government , " mr advani told reporters in the eastern indian city of bhubaneswar .
indian officials say they are confident that portugal will hand over mr salem .
" the situation in the world is such that wherever terrorists are present , and wherever laws are broken , everyone all over the world is united .
i do not see any problem , " the indian ambassador in lisbon said .
court appearance india 's central bureau of investigation says it will send a team to lisbon as soon as possible to try to secure abu salem 's deportation .
the cbi 's joint director , ashwini kumar , said photographs and fingerprints of abu salem , sent to lisbon after an interpol tip-off , had helped in the arrest .
" it -lsb- extradition -rsb- is possible through diplomatic channels and the legal process even without an extradition treaty , " he told a news conference in delhi .
" he will be there in judicial custody for 90 days . "
abu salem and his companion , bombay actress monica bedi , were arrested on wednesday .
he has since been produced in court , indian diplomats in lisbon say .
reports say another wanted indian , syed haider , may also have been arrested .
independent operator as well as being wanted for the bombings , abu salem is a suspect in a series of high-profile killings that have rocked bombay 's movie world .
these include the murder of top bollywood music producer gulshan kumar in 1997 .
abu salem fled india in the 1990s and settled in dubai in the united arab emirates where he was arrested last year .
he was released on bail when delhi failed to produce sufficient evidence to persuade police to hand him over .
abu salem , once considered a close aide to dawood ibrahim , india 's most-wanted man , is now believed to be operating independently .

but correspondents say mr dzurinda will be able to form the next government - the coalition of centre-right parties led by the sdku has managed to win the overall majority of votes for the 150-seat parliament .
