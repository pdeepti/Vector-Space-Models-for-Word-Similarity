in berlin , the church now hopes management consulter mckinsey will find a remedy to its financial woes . succumbing to the sin of euphoric spending , the catholic church in berlin pumped millions of marks into the building of schools , kindergartens and an academy after the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the church expected millions of newcomers to flock to germany 's reunified capital , including numerous devout churchgoers from the east .
but as the number of attendees failed to hurdle the 3.5 million mark , the church ’ s estimations proved dangerously wrong .
today , the catholic church in berlin is reported to have some 75 million euros in debt .
and the catholic church in berlin is not alone in its financial difficulties .
both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .
thus , it was pulled down to prevent further loss of revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's catholic churches are n't as high as the city 's tv tower , but they are still prominent landmarks the soft approach in berlin rumors circulating in the german media have now sparked fears that berlin , which has also turned to mckinsey for help , may now face a similar fate .
herzig negates these rumors : according to him , the 120 catholic churches in berlin are usually full .
" so far we have chosen the soft approach to save money , " herzig says , including a stop to further recruitment , more early retirement and a general budget freeze .
mckinsey now has until the end of next year to find ways of cutting down the catholic church 's huge 153 million budget in berlin .
the management consultants will now work their way through all areas of the church , including administration , schools and hospitals .
" if the current recession carries on , the need to curb spending will only become greater , " herzig says . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de god via satellite bibel tv - germany ’ s first solely christian television channel launched oct.1.

in berlin , the church now hopes management consulter mckinsey will find a remedy to its financial woes . succumbing to the sin of euphoric spending , the catholic church in berlin pumped millions of marks into the building of schools , kindergartens and an academy after the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the church expected millions of newcomers to flock to germany 's reunified capital , including numerous devout churchgoers from the east .
but as the number of attendees failed to hurdle the 3.5 million mark , the church ’ s estimations proved dangerously wrong .
today , the catholic church in berlin is reported to have some 75 million euros in debt .
and the catholic church in berlin is not alone in its financial difficulties .
both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .
thus , it was pulled down to prevent further loss of revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's catholic churches are n't as high as the city 's tv tower , but they are still prominent landmarks the soft approach in berlin rumors circulating in the german media have now sparked fears that berlin , which has also turned to mckinsey for help , may now face a similar fate .
herzig negates these rumors : according to him , the 120 catholic churches in berlin are usually full .
" so far we have chosen the soft approach to save money , " herzig says , including a stop to further recruitment , more early retirement and a general budget freeze .
mckinsey now has until the end of next year to find ways of cutting down the catholic church 's huge 153 million budget in berlin .
the management consultants will now work their way through all areas of the church , including administration , schools and hospitals .

in berlin , the church now hopes management consulter mckinsey will find a remedy to its financial woes . succumbing to the sin of euphoric spending , the catholic church in berlin pumped millions of marks into the building of schools , kindergartens and an academy after the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the church expected millions of newcomers to flock to germany 's reunified capital , including numerous devout churchgoers from the east .
but as the number of attendees failed to hurdle the 3.5 million mark , the church ’ s estimations proved dangerously wrong .
today , the catholic church in berlin is reported to have some 75 million euros in debt .
and the catholic church in berlin is not alone in its financial difficulties .
both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .

the city ’ s historic downtown center was transformed into a sea of balloons and banners protesting the prospect of u.s.-led military action against iraq .
the peace rally , which was billed as the climax of the five-day european social forum , brought together people from across europe in a massive show of support for a peaceful solution to the iraq conflict .
germany ’ s hans-christian ströbele , member of parliament and the green party ’ s most vocal peace activist , was in florence for the forum ’ s series of workshops and seminars under the motto " a new europe for a different world . "
ströbele told dw-tv that the half-a-million strong march on saturday reflected a " combination of the anti-globalization movement and a new movement for peace . "
he said " the hundreds of thousands of young people from all over europe are sending out a clear message to all governments , including the german government , not to go along with these plans -lsb- for a war on iraq -rsb- . "
european-wide protests planned a french spokesman for the anti-globalization network attac , which helped organize the forum , told reporters that it planned to stage protest days in mid-december and january .
these demonstrations would lead up to a european-wide anti-iraq-war protest on february 15th .
" our european network has agreed to organize on february 15 a european day – if possible international beginning with european capitals – to oppose the war in iraq , " christophe aguiton told ap wire reporters in florence .
germany ’ s attac network is also working to organize upcoming demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .

in berlin , the church now hopes management consulter mckinsey will find a remedy to its financial woes . succumbing to the sin of euphoric spending , the catholic church in berlin pumped millions of marks into the building of schools , kindergartens and an academy after the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the church expected millions of newcomers to flock to germany 's reunified capital , including numerous devout churchgoers from the east .
but as the number of attendees failed to hurdle the 3.5 million mark , the church ’ s estimations proved dangerously wrong .
today , the catholic church in berlin is reported to have some 75 million euros in debt .
and the catholic church in berlin is not alone in its financial difficulties .
both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .
thus , it was pulled down to prevent further loss of revenue .

herzig negates these rumors : according to him , the 120 catholic churches in berlin are usually full .
" so far we have chosen the soft approach to save money , " herzig says , including a stop to further recruitment , more early retirement and a general budget freeze .
mckinsey now has until the end of next year to find ways of cutting down the catholic church 's huge 153 million budget in berlin .
the management consultants will now work their way through all areas of the church , including administration , schools and hospitals .

in berlin , the church now hopes management consulter mckinsey will find a remedy to its financial woes . succumbing to the sin of euphoric spending , the catholic church in berlin pumped millions of marks into the building of schools , kindergartens and an academy after the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the church expected millions of newcomers to flock to germany 's reunified capital , including numerous devout churchgoers from the east .
but as the number of attendees failed to hurdle the 3.5 million mark , the church ’ s estimations proved dangerously wrong .
today , the catholic church in berlin is reported to have some 75 million euros in debt .
and the catholic church in berlin is not alone in its financial difficulties .
both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .
thus , it was pulled down to prevent further loss of revenue .

herzig negates these rumors : according to him , the 120 catholic churches in berlin are usually full .
" so far we have chosen the soft approach to save money , " herzig says , including a stop to further recruitment , more early retirement and a general budget freeze .
mckinsey now has until the end of next year to find ways of cutting down the catholic church 's huge 153 million budget in berlin .
the management consultants will now work their way through all areas of the church , including administration , schools and hospitals .

in berlin , the church now hopes management consulter mckinsey will find a remedy to its financial woes . succumbing to the sin of euphoric spending , the catholic church in berlin pumped millions of marks into the building of schools , kindergartens and an academy after the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the church expected millions of newcomers to flock to germany 's reunified capital , including numerous devout churchgoers from the east .
but as the number of attendees failed to hurdle the 3.5 million mark , the church ’ s estimations proved dangerously wrong .
today , the catholic church in berlin is reported to have some 75 million euros in debt .
and the catholic church in berlin is not alone in its financial difficulties .
both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .
thus , it was pulled down to prevent further loss of revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's catholic churches are n't as high as the city 's tv tower , but they are still prominent landmarks the soft approach in berlin rumors circulating in the german media have now sparked fears that berlin , which has also turned to mckinsey for help , may now face a similar fate .
herzig negates these rumors : according to him , the 120 catholic churches in berlin are usually full .
" so far we have chosen the soft approach to save money , " herzig says , including a stop to further recruitment , more early retirement and a general budget freeze .
mckinsey now has until the end of next year to find ways of cutting down the catholic church 's huge 153 million budget in berlin .
the management consultants will now work their way through all areas of the church , including administration , schools and hospitals .

the city ’ s historic downtown center was transformed into a sea of balloons and banners protesting the prospect of u.s.-led military action against iraq .
the peace rally , which was billed as the climax of the five-day european social forum , brought together people from across europe in a massive show of support for a peaceful solution to the iraq conflict .
germany ’ s hans-christian ströbele , member of parliament and the green party ’ s most vocal peace activist , was in florence for the forum ’ s series of workshops and seminars under the motto " a new europe for a different world . "
ströbele told dw-tv that the half-a-million strong march on saturday reflected a " combination of the anti-globalization movement and a new movement for peace . "
he said " the hundreds of thousands of young people from all over europe are sending out a clear message to all governments , including the german government , not to go along with these plans -lsb- for a war on iraq -rsb- . "
european-wide protests planned a french spokesman for the anti-globalization network attac , which helped organize the forum , told reporters that it planned to stage protest days in mid-december and january .
these demonstrations would lead up to a european-wide anti-iraq-war protest on february 15th .
" our european network has agreed to organize on february 15 a european day – if possible international beginning with european capitals – to oppose the war in iraq , " christophe aguiton told ap wire reporters in florence .
germany ’ s attac network is also working to organize upcoming demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .
jan siefers told dw-radio that germany had a special role to play in peace rallies .
" the german peace movement is a little behind the other peace movements and must become much stronger , " he said .
" germany now has a special role primarily because attention is focused on germany after -lsb- anti-war -rsb- statements made by -lsb- chancellor gerhard -rsb- schröder .
that means we must put on a large demonstration in december and then work together with other peace movements to prepare the european anti-war-day in february . "
in late september , peace activists in washington and other world capitals staged protests against the u.s. government ’ s stance on iraq , but the largest of the demonstrations – in london and rome – only drew about 100,000 people each .
the estimated 500,000 who attended the march in florence was the biggest turnout for an anti-war protest yet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-globalists arrive in florence for european social forum anti-globalists gathered in florence amid heightened security to discuss and seek alternatives to mainstream economic thinking .

the city ’ s historic downtown center was transformed into a sea of balloons and banners protesting the prospect of u.s.-led military action against iraq .
the peace rally , which was billed as the climax of the five-day european social forum , brought together people from across europe in a massive show of support for a peaceful solution to the iraq conflict .
germany ’ s hans-christian ströbele , member of parliament and the green party ’ s most vocal peace activist , was in florence for the forum ’ s series of workshops and seminars under the motto " a new europe for a different world . "
ströbele told dw-tv that the half-a-million strong march on saturday reflected a " combination of the anti-globalization movement and a new movement for peace . "
he said " the hundreds of thousands of young people from all over europe are sending out a clear message to all governments , including the german government , not to go along with these plans -lsb- for a war on iraq -rsb- . "

in late september , peace activists in washington and other world capitals staged protests against the u.s. government ’ s stance on iraq , but the largest of the demonstrations – in london and rome – only drew about 100,000 people each .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.11.2002 german recession hits catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finances are causing the catholic church a headache the catholic church is the next bulwark to crumble under germany 's continuing recession .
in berlin , the church now hopes management consulter mckinsey will find a remedy to its financial woes . succumbing to the sin of euphoric spending , the catholic church in berlin pumped millions of marks into the building of schools , kindergartens and an academy after the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the church expected millions of newcomers to flock to germany 's reunified capital , including numerous devout churchgoers from the east .
but as the number of attendees failed to hurdle the 3.5 million mark , the church ’ s estimations proved dangerously wrong .
today , the catholic church in berlin is reported to have some 75 million euros in debt .
and the catholic church in berlin is not alone in its financial difficulties .
both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .
thus , it was pulled down to prevent further loss of revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's catholic churches are n't as high as the city 's tv tower , but they are still prominent landmarks the soft approach in berlin rumors circulating in the german media have now sparked fears that berlin , which has also turned to mckinsey for help , may now face a similar fate .
herzig negates these rumors : according to him , the 120 catholic churches in berlin are usually full .
" so far we have chosen the soft approach to save money , " herzig says , including a stop to further recruitment , more early retirement and a general budget freeze .
mckinsey now has until the end of next year to find ways of cutting down the catholic church 's huge 153 million budget in berlin .
the management consultants will now work their way through all areas of the church , including administration , schools and hospitals .
" if the current recession carries on , the need to curb spending will only become greater , " herzig says . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de god via satellite bibel tv - germany ’ s first solely christian television channel launched oct.1.

in berlin , the church now hopes management consulter mckinsey will find a remedy to its financial woes . succumbing to the sin of euphoric spending , the catholic church in berlin pumped millions of marks into the building of schools , kindergartens and an academy after the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the church expected millions of newcomers to flock to germany 's reunified capital , including numerous devout churchgoers from the east .
but as the number of attendees failed to hurdle the 3.5 million mark , the church ’ s estimations proved dangerously wrong .
today , the catholic church in berlin is reported to have some 75 million euros in debt .
and the catholic church in berlin is not alone in its financial difficulties .
both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .

the city ’ s historic downtown center was transformed into a sea of balloons and banners protesting the prospect of u.s.-led military action against iraq .
the peace rally , which was billed as the climax of the five-day european social forum , brought together people from across europe in a massive show of support for a peaceful solution to the iraq conflict .
germany ’ s hans-christian ströbele , member of parliament and the green party ’ s most vocal peace activist , was in florence for the forum ’ s series of workshops and seminars under the motto " a new europe for a different world . "
ströbele told dw-tv that the half-a-million strong march on saturday reflected a " combination of the anti-globalization movement and a new movement for peace . "
he said " the hundreds of thousands of young people from all over europe are sending out a clear message to all governments , including the german government , not to go along with these plans -lsb- for a war on iraq -rsb- . "
european-wide protests planned a french spokesman for the anti-globalization network attac , which helped organize the forum , told reporters that it planned to stage protest days in mid-december and january .
these demonstrations would lead up to a european-wide anti-iraq-war protest on february 15th .
" our european network has agreed to organize on february 15 a european day – if possible international beginning with european capitals – to oppose the war in iraq , " christophe aguiton told ap wire reporters in florence .
germany ’ s attac network is also working to organize upcoming demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .
jan siefers told dw-radio that germany had a special role to play in peace rallies .
" the german peace movement is a little behind the other peace movements and must become much stronger , " he said .
" germany now has a special role primarily because attention is focused on germany after -lsb- anti-war -rsb- statements made by -lsb- chancellor gerhard -rsb- schröder .
that means we must put on a large demonstration in december and then work together with other peace movements to prepare the european anti-war-day in february . "
in late september , peace activists in washington and other world capitals staged protests against the u.s. government ’ s stance on iraq , but the largest of the demonstrations – in london and rome – only drew about 100,000 people each .
the estimated 500,000 who attended the march in florence was the biggest turnout for an anti-war protest yet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-globalists arrive in florence for european social forum anti-globalists gathered in florence amid heightened security to discuss and seek alternatives to mainstream economic thinking .

in berlin , the church now hopes management consulter mckinsey will find a remedy to its financial woes . succumbing to the sin of euphoric spending , the catholic church in berlin pumped millions of marks into the building of schools , kindergartens and an academy after the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the church expected millions of newcomers to flock to germany 's reunified capital , including numerous devout churchgoers from the east .
but as the number of attendees failed to hurdle the 3.5 million mark , the church ’ s estimations proved dangerously wrong .
today , the catholic church in berlin is reported to have some 75 million euros in debt .
and the catholic church in berlin is not alone in its financial difficulties .
both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .
thus , it was pulled down to prevent further loss of revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's catholic churches are n't as high as the city 's tv tower , but they are still prominent landmarks the soft approach in berlin rumors circulating in the german media have now sparked fears that berlin , which has also turned to mckinsey for help , may now face a similar fate .
herzig negates these rumors : according to him , the 120 catholic churches in berlin are usually full .
" so far we have chosen the soft approach to save money , " herzig says , including a stop to further recruitment , more early retirement and a general budget freeze .
mckinsey now has until the end of next year to find ways of cutting down the catholic church 's huge 153 million budget in berlin .
the management consultants will now work their way through all areas of the church , including administration , schools and hospitals .

the city ’ s historic downtown center was transformed into a sea of balloons and banners protesting the prospect of u.s.-led military action against iraq .
the peace rally , which was billed as the climax of the five-day european social forum , brought together people from across europe in a massive show of support for a peaceful solution to the iraq conflict .
germany ’ s hans-christian ströbele , member of parliament and the green party ’ s most vocal peace activist , was in florence for the forum ’ s series of workshops and seminars under the motto " a new europe for a different world . "
ströbele told dw-tv that the half-a-million strong march on saturday reflected a " combination of the anti-globalization movement and a new movement for peace . "
he said " the hundreds of thousands of young people from all over europe are sending out a clear message to all governments , including the german government , not to go along with these plans -lsb- for a war on iraq -rsb- . "
european-wide protests planned a french spokesman for the anti-globalization network attac , which helped organize the forum , told reporters that it planned to stage protest days in mid-december and january .
these demonstrations would lead up to a european-wide anti-iraq-war protest on february 15th .
" our european network has agreed to organize on february 15 a european day – if possible international beginning with european capitals – to oppose the war in iraq , " christophe aguiton told ap wire reporters in florence .
germany ’ s attac network is also working to organize upcoming demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .
jan siefers told dw-radio that germany had a special role to play in peace rallies .
" the german peace movement is a little behind the other peace movements and must become much stronger , " he said .
" germany now has a special role primarily because attention is focused on germany after -lsb- anti-war -rsb- statements made by -lsb- chancellor gerhard -rsb- schröder .
that means we must put on a large demonstration in december and then work together with other peace movements to prepare the european anti-war-day in february . "
in late september , peace activists in washington and other world capitals staged protests against the u.s. government ’ s stance on iraq , but the largest of the demonstrations – in london and rome – only drew about 100,000 people each .

in berlin , the church now hopes management consulter mckinsey will find a remedy to its financial woes . succumbing to the sin of euphoric spending , the catholic church in berlin pumped millions of marks into the building of schools , kindergartens and an academy after the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the church expected millions of newcomers to flock to germany 's reunified capital , including numerous devout churchgoers from the east .
but as the number of attendees failed to hurdle the 3.5 million mark , the church ’ s estimations proved dangerously wrong .
today , the catholic church in berlin is reported to have some 75 million euros in debt .
and the catholic church in berlin is not alone in its financial difficulties .
both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .
thus , it was pulled down to prevent further loss of revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's catholic churches are n't as high as the city 's tv tower , but they are still prominent landmarks the soft approach in berlin rumors circulating in the german media have now sparked fears that berlin , which has also turned to mckinsey for help , may now face a similar fate .
herzig negates these rumors : according to him , the 120 catholic churches in berlin are usually full .
" so far we have chosen the soft approach to save money , " herzig says , including a stop to further recruitment , more early retirement and a general budget freeze .
mckinsey now has until the end of next year to find ways of cutting down the catholic church 's huge 153 million budget in berlin .
the management consultants will now work their way through all areas of the church , including administration , schools and hospitals .

both münster and osnabrück have already commissioned the management consultant mckinsey to find a remedy for the church 's running financial woes .
in essen , the consultants even advised the community to pull down a church in an effort to save money .
there are now fears that berlin , the next catholic community to be advised by mckinsey , may face the same fate .
a consequence of economic slump the catholic church is the latest social and cultural bulwark to crumble under germany 's ongoing economic slump .
according to andreas herzig , spokesman of the catholic church in berlin , the current recession is the main contributor to the church ’ s strained financial situation .
" church taxes are tied to income taxes – and with more and more people unemployed , there are less people paying taxes , including church taxes , " herzig says .
all germans are required to pay church taxes , which are based on a percent of their overall income , if they profess belonging to a church .
the tax goes to paying for personnel , building projects – including restoration work on historic churches – and social and education projects .
according to the association of dioceses in germany , church tax revenues are expected to drop by 50 million euros to around 4.2 million euros this year .
the situation is particularly difficult in berlin where 14 percent of the city 's population is unemployed and therefore exempt from paying the church tax .
" in berlin , we were mislead by the euphoria in the early nineties , " herzig told dw-world .
after reunification , the catholic church in berlin expected the city 's population to grow to 5 million .
the church started building schools and hospitals with an enthusiasm common during the early years of reunification .
but the population failed to rise as rapidly as expected , and for several of the church 's larger building projects , including the catholic academy , the church had to seek help from the banks .
fewer believers in addition , the catholic church in berlin is faced with a problem which has affected the church throughout the country : in recent years , the number of members has plunged , from 28.2 million in 1990 , to 26.6 million today .
because the amount of money the church receives from taxes is based on the number of its members , a dwindling figure means less in the coffers .
critical estimates put active churchgoers at less than 10 percent of members of germany 's combined 50 million strong catholic-protestant community .
more forgiving estimates say around a third .
it is mainly for this reason that the church in essen was pulled down : here , the catholic church had commissioned management consultant mckinsey to find a solution for its financial difficulties .
mckinsey 's diligent research showed that in one community churchgoers and members had dwindled to such an extent that there was no reason for maintaining the local church .
thus , it was pulled down to prevent further loss of revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's catholic churches are n't as high as the city 's tv tower , but they are still prominent landmarks the soft approach in berlin rumors circulating in the german media have now sparked fears that berlin , which has also turned to mckinsey for help , may now face a similar fate .
herzig negates these rumors : according to him , the 120 catholic churches in berlin are usually full .
" so far we have chosen the soft approach to save money , " herzig says , including a stop to further recruitment , more early retirement and a general budget freeze .
mckinsey now has until the end of next year to find ways of cutting down the catholic church 's huge 153 million budget in berlin .
the management consultants will now work their way through all areas of the church , including administration , schools and hospitals .
" if the current recession carries on , the need to curb spending will only become greater , " herzig says . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de god via satellite bibel tv - germany ’ s first solely christian television channel launched oct.1.

tears and applause greeted the actors as they came on stage for the memorial performance on saturday evening .
nord-ost will return , that is certain , and tonight 's concert is the first sign of that yekaterina guseva , cast member alexander tsekalo , the musical 's producer , told the packed audience : " we want to show with today 's performance that we 've been hurt but we are still alive .
nord-ost might be wounded and limping but it survived and it will go on . "
on 23 october , more than 40 armed chechen guerrillas seized the theatre mid-performance , threatening kill everyone inside if their demand to end the russian military occupation in chechnya was not met .
russian forces surrounded the theatre in a three-day siege that ended when they pumped nerve gas into the theatre and stormed the building , killing all 40 of the guerrillas but also leaving 120 hostages dead .
' nord-ost will return ' the memorial concert , based in the concert hall of moscow 's huge rossia hotel , was scheduled weeks ago to mark the first anniversary of the successful musical .
but after last month 's siege at the dubrovka theatre , the concert was retitled " nord-ost , we 're with you " .
the packed hall was filled with emotion " our concert is in honour of those who died , were injured or are in hospital , " said yekaterina guseva , who plays the lead female role .
" nord-ost will return , that is certain , and tonight 's concert is the first sign of that , " she said .
the musical is based on " two captains " , a popular russian novel about two heroes of polar exploration .
but instead of a full performance , the audience heard a selection of the show 's songs , together with numbers from other famous musicals such as cats , les miserables and the lion king .
during the show , writer-producer georgy vasilyev asked for a minute 's silence as a mark of respect .
but he also then urged the audience to continue in their theatre-going ways , " as we must not let evil conquer " .
eight places in the orchestra were left empty during the performance to mark the absence of the eight musicians who died during the attack .
donations needed the takings from the concerts - and a second show on sunday - will go towards helping the musical get back on its feet .
nord-ost has been virtually bankrupted by the material losses suffered in the siege .
yekaterina guseva vowed that nord-ost would return " if we are able to gather some donations for restoring the musical , then that would be a blessing , " said eorgia vasilev , nord-ost 's theatre director .
the performers are now preparing to take nord-ost on a tour of russia , and negotiations are even under way to take the show to israel .
eventually , however , the russian government would like to see it return to its original venue as a symbol of victory over terrorism .
the dubrovka theatre is expected to reopen in mid-january , following repairs mostly financed by the government , but many of the organisers and cast are still reluctant to return to the scene of the attack .
chechen conference meanwhile , russian human rights groups discussed a peace plan for the war-torn republic of chechnya at a conference on saturday .
sergei kovalyov , a state duma deputy , put forward a plan envisaging international involvement in the negotiating process .
" we are at a dead end in chechnya .
the situation may degenerate into ethnic cleansing , stalin-style deportations and genocide , " mr kovalyov warned the conference .
the kremlin , however , is angry that the conference is taking place at all .
the presidential human rights envoy for chechnya , abdul khakim sultygov , said it was intended to " form an image of international terrorism with a human face " and was in fact aimed at fulfilling the terrorists ' demands ..
the russian authorities maintain that since last month 's hostage crisis , they have no valid interlocutor for negotiations on chechnya , accusing chechen leader aslan maskhadov of being involved in the siege .

the sunday telegraph suggests some people would wish the british royal family would adopt the ancient egyptian tradition of taking everything them when they died , including servants .
page after page in the tabloids is given over to more lurid sex allegations involving servants in the royal palaces and claims of an attempted cover-up .
a former valet tells the mail on sunday he was raped by a member of staff in the prince of wales 's household and describes in graphic detail how the alleged assault took place .
he tells how princess diana coaxed the allegations out of him .
the mail concludes that public confidence in the propriety of the royals has all but collapsed because of the inglorious efforts of the police , the courts and the queen to protect prince charles from embarrassment over the behaviour of a servant .
marriage trio after a week of revelations by mr burrell , it is now the turn of his wife to tell her story .
in an interview with the sunday mirror , maria burrell speaks of the intense strain her husband 's undying loyalty to diana had on their marriage .
preparing for war headlines warning of the threat to britain from al-qaeda terrorists make chilling reading .
will it be " carnage by christmas " ? asks the sunday express , which says everything from an attack on the house of commons , to suicide bombings on trains and ships is considered possible in the coming weeks .
the observer reports that emergency security measures - including a rapid reaction force of army reservists - are in place to cope with a terrorist strike .
police snipers are being trained to kill suicide bombers and anti-radiation pills are being distributed to hospitals , it says .
according to the sunday mirror , tony blair will make a speech tomorrow calling on the british people to adopt the spirit of the blitz in the face of international terrorism .
wheelchair insurance thousands of disabled people who use a motorised wheelchair face having to take out a form of car insurance , according to the telegraph .
it says ministers are planning to make the insurance compulsory after a spate of accidents in which pedestrians have been injured and property has been damaged .
on one occasion , an elderly woman crashed through a shop window in devon and then left without giving her name .
a spokesman for the disabled drivers ' motor club says the plans are over the top and points out that electric wheelchairs are slower than cycles , with a maximum speed of only eight miles per hour .
cash for canvas the sunday times claims to have discovered that some of the country 's top art galleries and museums are willing to display paintings in return for money .
an undercover reporter , posing as a banker with £ 1m to donate , had told the galleries the cash would be forthcoming , only if they displayed his self-portrait .
the reaction was instant , he says , as officials told him how much they liked the picture .
the would-be artist and benefactor had in fact not painted since he was a child , and he had completed the portrait in 10 minutes with help from his seven-year-old daughter .
