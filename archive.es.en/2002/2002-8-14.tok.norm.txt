in germany , at least three people died in storm-related accidents on monday and authorities are still tallying the numbers of missing people in the hard-hit states of saxony , thuringia and bavaria .
states of emergency have been declared in each of these states .
the german defense ministry reported on tuesday morning that 1,500 soldiers have been engaged to fight the floods , with thousands more on stand-by should the situation worsen .
the soldiers are filling sandbags and erecting diversion walls in areas where the flood risk is high .
flooding in dresden forced authorities to begin evacuations early tuesday .
some streets stood 75 centimeters -lrb- 29.5 inches -rrb- under water .
in the bavarian city of passau , the donau climbed to 10.5 meters -lrb- 34.4 feet -rrb- and much of the downtown area was flooded .
authorities estimated that the river would climb to 10.7 meters , the highest level since 1954 .
the german storm-related deaths include an 8-year-old munich girl who died after being hit by a falling tree ; a police officer who died in an accident on the way to flood-related duty ; and a dresden woman who collapsed after bailing out her flooded basement .
eastern europe especially hard hit in prague , a few hundred kilometers toward the east of dresden , approximately 40,000 residents were evacuated because of flooding along the vlatva river .
soldiers were stationed in the evacuated areas to discourage vandalism .
the flooding is said to be the worst in at least 100 years , and prague mayor igor nemec said experts feared the vlatva may burst its banks later on tuesday .
czech authorties reported that at least 7 czechs have died in the storms .
prague and four other regions of the country have been declared states of emergency .
in austria , much of the country was under water on tuesday after several rivers overflowed , flooding town and closing highways and railways .

here a look at which regenerative energies play a role in germany ’ s energy market . while environmentalists and scientists world-wide debate the origins of global warming and its effects on the world ’ s climate , one fact remains undisputed – people all over the globe are consuming more and more energy daily .
it ’ s still unclear to what extent rising levels of energy consumption are responsible for climatic change .
but the latest weather catastrophes in europe have triggered a debate in germany about moving away from fossil fuels and towards the use of alternative sources of energy .
in 1999 germany renounced the use of nuclear power - which accounts for 30 percent of its energy consumption .
the governing social democratic-green coalition considers nuclear power and the disposal of radioactive waste too dangerous .
germany moves towards regenerative energy the country has made efforts to move away from polluting fossil fuels and embrace alternative energies , in particular solar power .
at present , 7 percent of germany 's electricity is generated using alternative energy sources .
after the passing of the renewable energies law in april 2000 that sought to encourage a switch to renewable energies , germany experienced a sort of solar boom .
the southwestern city of freiburg boasts the first hotel in europe run entirely on alternative energy sources .

increasing complaints about generators close to homes have led to a sharp drop in wind energy 's popularity .

in germany , at least three people died in storm-related accidents on monday and authorities are still tallying the numbers of missing people in the hard-hit states of saxony , thuringia and bavaria .
states of emergency have been declared in each of these states .
the german defense ministry reported on tuesday morning that 1,500 soldiers have been engaged to fight the floods , with thousands more on stand-by should the situation worsen .
the soldiers are filling sandbags and erecting diversion walls in areas where the flood risk is high .
flooding in dresden forced authorities to begin evacuations early tuesday .
some streets stood 75 centimeters -lrb- 29.5 inches -rrb- under water .
in the bavarian city of passau , the donau climbed to 10.5 meters -lrb- 34.4 feet -rrb- and much of the downtown area was flooded .
authorities estimated that the river would climb to 10.7 meters , the highest level since 1954 .
the german storm-related deaths include an 8-year-old munich girl who died after being hit by a falling tree ; a police officer who died in an accident on the way to flood-related duty ; and a dresden woman who collapsed after bailing out her flooded basement .
eastern europe especially hard hit in prague , a few hundred kilometers toward the east of dresden , approximately 40,000 residents were evacuated because of flooding along the vlatva river .
soldiers were stationed in the evacuated areas to discourage vandalism .
the flooding is said to be the worst in at least 100 years , and prague mayor igor nemec said experts feared the vlatva may burst its banks later on tuesday .
czech authorties reported that at least 7 czechs have died in the storms .
prague and four other regions of the country have been declared states of emergency .
in austria , much of the country was under water on tuesday after several rivers overflowed , flooding town and closing highways and railways .
authorities said at least four people have died in the storms , including a fireman who drowned after his car sank into a water-logged field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storms also hit bulgaria , romania , hungary and poland and followed heavy storms that hit russia ’ s black sea coast late last week , claiming at least 58 lives as roads , bridges and houses collapsed .
this week , rescue crews were hard at work , looking for survivors along the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,123 square feet -rrb- of collapsed coastline .
environment minister : industrialization is to blame german environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- greens -rrb- blamed the flooding on what he called " the results of 100 years of industrialization . "
he said international efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions have been insufficient and called for greater focus on this issue .
under the kyoto pact , germany agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent and has already reduced it by 19 percent .
" in this area we are way out front , " trittin said , as he called for other countries to place similar focus on climate protection .
weather forecasters said hard rain would continue on tuesday before it turned to scattered showers on wednesday .

in germany , at least three people died in storm-related accidents on monday and authorities are still tallying the numbers of missing people in the hard-hit states of saxony , thuringia and bavaria .
states of emergency have been declared in each of these states .
the german defense ministry reported on tuesday morning that 1,500 soldiers have been engaged to fight the floods , with thousands more on stand-by should the situation worsen .
the soldiers are filling sandbags and erecting diversion walls in areas where the flood risk is high .
flooding in dresden forced authorities to begin evacuations early tuesday .
some streets stood 75 centimeters -lrb- 29.5 inches -rrb- under water .
in the bavarian city of passau , the donau climbed to 10.5 meters -lrb- 34.4 feet -rrb- and much of the downtown area was flooded .
authorities estimated that the river would climb to 10.7 meters , the highest level since 1954 .
the german storm-related deaths include an 8-year-old munich girl who died after being hit by a falling tree ; a police officer who died in an accident on the way to flood-related duty ; and a dresden woman who collapsed after bailing out her flooded basement .
eastern europe especially hard hit in prague , a few hundred kilometers toward the east of dresden , approximately 40,000 residents were evacuated because of flooding along the vlatva river .
soldiers were stationed in the evacuated areas to discourage vandalism .
the flooding is said to be the worst in at least 100 years , and prague mayor igor nemec said experts feared the vlatva may burst its banks later on tuesday .
czech authorties reported that at least 7 czechs have died in the storms .
prague and four other regions of the country have been declared states of emergency .
in austria , much of the country was under water on tuesday after several rivers overflowed , flooding town and closing highways and railways .
authorities said at least four people have died in the storms , including a fireman who drowned after his car sank into a water-logged field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storms also hit bulgaria , romania , hungary and poland and followed heavy storms that hit russia ’ s black sea coast late last week , claiming at least 58 lives as roads , bridges and houses collapsed .
this week , rescue crews were hard at work , looking for survivors along the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,123 square feet -rrb- of collapsed coastline .
environment minister : industrialization is to blame german environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- greens -rrb- blamed the flooding on what he called " the results of 100 years of industrialization . "
he said international efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions have been insufficient and called for greater focus on this issue .
under the kyoto pact , germany agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent and has already reduced it by 19 percent .
" in this area we are way out front , " trittin said , as he called for other countries to place similar focus on climate protection .
weather forecasters said hard rain would continue on tuesday before it turned to scattered showers on wednesday .
but even this change of weather might not bring flood relief , experts warned .

in germany , at least three people died in storm-related accidents on monday and authorities are still tallying the numbers of missing people in the hard-hit states of saxony , thuringia and bavaria .
states of emergency have been declared in each of these states .
the german defense ministry reported on tuesday morning that 1,500 soldiers have been engaged to fight the floods , with thousands more on stand-by should the situation worsen .
the soldiers are filling sandbags and erecting diversion walls in areas where the flood risk is high .
flooding in dresden forced authorities to begin evacuations early tuesday .
some streets stood 75 centimeters -lrb- 29.5 inches -rrb- under water .
in the bavarian city of passau , the donau climbed to 10.5 meters -lrb- 34.4 feet -rrb- and much of the downtown area was flooded .
authorities estimated that the river would climb to 10.7 meters , the highest level since 1954 .
the german storm-related deaths include an 8-year-old munich girl who died after being hit by a falling tree ; a police officer who died in an accident on the way to flood-related duty ; and a dresden woman who collapsed after bailing out her flooded basement .
eastern europe especially hard hit in prague , a few hundred kilometers toward the east of dresden , approximately 40,000 residents were evacuated because of flooding along the vlatva river .
soldiers were stationed in the evacuated areas to discourage vandalism .
the flooding is said to be the worst in at least 100 years , and prague mayor igor nemec said experts feared the vlatva may burst its banks later on tuesday .
czech authorties reported that at least 7 czechs have died in the storms .
prague and four other regions of the country have been declared states of emergency .
in austria , much of the country was under water on tuesday after several rivers overflowed , flooding town and closing highways and railways .
authorities said at least four people have died in the storms , including a fireman who drowned after his car sank into a water-logged field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storms also hit bulgaria , romania , hungary and poland and followed heavy storms that hit russia ’ s black sea coast late last week , claiming at least 58 lives as roads , bridges and houses collapsed .
this week , rescue crews were hard at work , looking for survivors along the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,123 square feet -rrb- of collapsed coastline .
environment minister : industrialization is to blame german environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- greens -rrb- blamed the flooding on what he called " the results of 100 years of industrialization . "
he said international efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions have been insufficient and called for greater focus on this issue .
under the kyoto pact , germany agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent and has already reduced it by 19 percent .
" in this area we are way out front , " trittin said , as he called for other countries to place similar focus on climate protection .
weather forecasters said hard rain would continue on tuesday before it turned to scattered showers on wednesday .

in germany , at least three people died in storm-related accidents on monday and authorities are still tallying the numbers of missing people in the hard-hit states of saxony , thuringia and bavaria .
states of emergency have been declared in each of these states .
the german defense ministry reported on tuesday morning that 1,500 soldiers have been engaged to fight the floods , with thousands more on stand-by should the situation worsen .
the soldiers are filling sandbags and erecting diversion walls in areas where the flood risk is high .
flooding in dresden forced authorities to begin evacuations early tuesday .
some streets stood 75 centimeters -lrb- 29.5 inches -rrb- under water .
in the bavarian city of passau , the donau climbed to 10.5 meters -lrb- 34.4 feet -rrb- and much of the downtown area was flooded .
authorities estimated that the river would climb to 10.7 meters , the highest level since 1954 .
the german storm-related deaths include an 8-year-old munich girl who died after being hit by a falling tree ; a police officer who died in an accident on the way to flood-related duty ; and a dresden woman who collapsed after bailing out her flooded basement .
eastern europe especially hard hit in prague , a few hundred kilometers toward the east of dresden , approximately 40,000 residents were evacuated because of flooding along the vlatva river .
soldiers were stationed in the evacuated areas to discourage vandalism .

environment minister : industrialization is to blame german environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- greens -rrb- blamed the flooding on what he called " the results of 100 years of industrialization . "
he said international efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions have been insufficient and called for greater focus on this issue .

here a look at which regenerative energies play a role in germany ’ s energy market . while environmentalists and scientists world-wide debate the origins of global warming and its effects on the world ’ s climate , one fact remains undisputed – people all over the globe are consuming more and more energy daily .
it ’ s still unclear to what extent rising levels of energy consumption are responsible for climatic change .
but the latest weather catastrophes in europe have triggered a debate in germany about moving away from fossil fuels and towards the use of alternative sources of energy .
in 1999 germany renounced the use of nuclear power - which accounts for 30 percent of its energy consumption .
the governing social democratic-green coalition considers nuclear power and the disposal of radioactive waste too dangerous .
germany moves towards regenerative energy the country has made efforts to move away from polluting fossil fuels and embrace alternative energies , in particular solar power .
at present , 7 percent of germany 's electricity is generated using alternative energy sources .
after the passing of the renewable energies law in april 2000 that sought to encourage a switch to renewable energies , germany experienced a sort of solar boom .
the southwestern city of freiburg boasts the first hotel in europe run entirely on alternative energy sources .
but despite the solar push , power from the sun today provides a mere 0,0006 percent of germany 's electricity .
wind and water another popular source of alternative energy in germany is hydroelectric power , which makes up more than half of alternative energy segment in the country .
but experts believe that hydroelectric power -lrb- photo -rrb- is pushing its limits and has already exhausted 80 percent of its potential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenwarte 2 in thueringen it has also become increasingly difficult to find large rivers in which to set up generators without the ecology of the region being adversely affected .
wind energy , once touted as the best form of alternative energy , today produces 3 percent of germany ’ s electricity .
but these huge wind fans throw equally large shadows and can be noisy .
increasing complaints about generators close to homes have led to a sharp drop in wind energy 's popularity .
in addition , experts think that the best windy places in the country are already taken up and the future of wind energy lies in offshore wind farms .
but there , production costs are high .
opposition could put up barriers the opposition union parties who look increasingly set to win the elections in september are reported to have made clear that they will not carry on with the proposed phasing-out of nuclear power set in motion by the current governing coalition .
they are also believed to be mainly interested in promoting biomass energy among the sources of renewable energy known in germany .
the economic spokesperson of the union parties , matthias wissmann , recently said in a statement that renewable energy was just too expensive to seriously consider pursuing .
but advocates of alternative energy argue that the slightly higher costs are worth the investment , especially if germany is to honour its commitment to the kyoto protocol and reduce its carbon emissions by 8 percent by 2010 .
coal is germany ’ s only major domestic fuel source and accounts for over 50 percent of electricity generation .
solar expert harald schützeichel said in an interview with der tagesspiegel newspaper on wednesday , " if we convert it into the electricity price , coal-driven plants cost us 0,5 cents while the subvention for renewable costs us 0,05 cents .

in germany , at least three people died in storm-related accidents on monday and authorities are still tallying the numbers of missing people in the hard-hit states of saxony , thuringia and bavaria .
states of emergency have been declared in each of these states .
the german defense ministry reported on tuesday morning that 1,500 soldiers have been engaged to fight the floods , with thousands more on stand-by should the situation worsen .
the soldiers are filling sandbags and erecting diversion walls in areas where the flood risk is high .
flooding in dresden forced authorities to begin evacuations early tuesday .
some streets stood 75 centimeters -lrb- 29.5 inches -rrb- under water .
in the bavarian city of passau , the donau climbed to 10.5 meters -lrb- 34.4 feet -rrb- and much of the downtown area was flooded .
authorities estimated that the river would climb to 10.7 meters , the highest level since 1954 .
the german storm-related deaths include an 8-year-old munich girl who died after being hit by a falling tree ; a police officer who died in an accident on the way to flood-related duty ; and a dresden woman who collapsed after bailing out her flooded basement .
eastern europe especially hard hit in prague , a few hundred kilometers toward the east of dresden , approximately 40,000 residents were evacuated because of flooding along the vlatva river .
soldiers were stationed in the evacuated areas to discourage vandalism .
the flooding is said to be the worst in at least 100 years , and prague mayor igor nemec said experts feared the vlatva may burst its banks later on tuesday .
czech authorties reported that at least 7 czechs have died in the storms .
prague and four other regions of the country have been declared states of emergency .
in austria , much of the country was under water on tuesday after several rivers overflowed , flooding town and closing highways and railways .
authorities said at least four people have died in the storms , including a fireman who drowned after his car sank into a water-logged field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storms also hit bulgaria , romania , hungary and poland and followed heavy storms that hit russia ’ s black sea coast late last week , claiming at least 58 lives as roads , bridges and houses collapsed .
this week , rescue crews were hard at work , looking for survivors along the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,123 square feet -rrb- of collapsed coastline .
environment minister : industrialization is to blame german environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- greens -rrb- blamed the flooding on what he called " the results of 100 years of industrialization . "
he said international efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions have been insufficient and called for greater focus on this issue .
under the kyoto pact , germany agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent and has already reduced it by 19 percent .
" in this area we are way out front , " trittin said , as he called for other countries to place similar focus on climate protection .
weather forecasters said hard rain would continue on tuesday before it turned to scattered showers on wednesday .
but even this change of weather might not bring flood relief , experts warned .
" the flooding will really hit after the weather improves in the middle of the week , " said a spokesman for the german weather service in frankfurt . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european union approves kyoto protocol the member states of the european union on monday approved the kyoto protocol , which the united states had earlier rejected . -lrb- march 4 , 2002 -rrb- www-links official site of the german weather service weather reports and meteorological research .

here a look at which regenerative energies play a role in germany ’ s energy market . while environmentalists and scientists world-wide debate the origins of global warming and its effects on the world ’ s climate , one fact remains undisputed – people all over the globe are consuming more and more energy daily .
it ’ s still unclear to what extent rising levels of energy consumption are responsible for climatic change .
but the latest weather catastrophes in europe have triggered a debate in germany about moving away from fossil fuels and towards the use of alternative sources of energy .
in 1999 germany renounced the use of nuclear power - which accounts for 30 percent of its energy consumption .
the governing social democratic-green coalition considers nuclear power and the disposal of radioactive waste too dangerous .
germany moves towards regenerative energy the country has made efforts to move away from polluting fossil fuels and embrace alternative energies , in particular solar power .
at present , 7 percent of germany 's electricity is generated using alternative energy sources .
after the passing of the renewable energies law in april 2000 that sought to encourage a switch to renewable energies , germany experienced a sort of solar boom .
the southwestern city of freiburg boasts the first hotel in europe run entirely on alternative energy sources .
but despite the solar push , power from the sun today provides a mere 0,0006 percent of germany 's electricity .
wind and water another popular source of alternative energy in germany is hydroelectric power , which makes up more than half of alternative energy segment in the country .
but experts believe that hydroelectric power -lrb- photo -rrb- is pushing its limits and has already exhausted 80 percent of its potential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenwarte 2 in thueringen it has also become increasingly difficult to find large rivers in which to set up generators without the ecology of the region being adversely affected .
wind energy , once touted as the best form of alternative energy , today produces 3 percent of germany ’ s electricity .
but these huge wind fans throw equally large shadows and can be noisy .
increasing complaints about generators close to homes have led to a sharp drop in wind energy 's popularity .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storms also hit bulgaria , romania , hungary and poland and followed heavy storms that hit russia ’ s black sea coast late last week , claiming at least 58 lives as roads , bridges and houses collapsed .
this week , rescue crews were hard at work , looking for survivors along the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,123 square feet -rrb- of collapsed coastline .
environment minister : industrialization is to blame german environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- greens -rrb- blamed the flooding on what he called " the results of 100 years of industrialization . "
he said international efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions have been insufficient and called for greater focus on this issue .
under the kyoto pact , germany agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent and has already reduced it by 19 percent .
" in this area we are way out front , " trittin said , as he called for other countries to place similar focus on climate protection .
weather forecasters said hard rain would continue on tuesday before it turned to scattered showers on wednesday .
but even this change of weather might not bring flood relief , experts warned .
" the flooding will really hit after the weather improves in the middle of the week , " said a spokesman for the german weather service in frankfurt . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european union approves kyoto protocol the member states of the european union on monday approved the kyoto protocol , which the united states had earlier rejected . -lrb- march 4 , 2002 -rrb- www-links official site of the german weather service weather reports and meteorological research .

here a look at which regenerative energies play a role in germany ’ s energy market . while environmentalists and scientists world-wide debate the origins of global warming and its effects on the world ’ s climate , one fact remains undisputed – people all over the globe are consuming more and more energy daily .
it ’ s still unclear to what extent rising levels of energy consumption are responsible for climatic change .
but the latest weather catastrophes in europe have triggered a debate in germany about moving away from fossil fuels and towards the use of alternative sources of energy .
in 1999 germany renounced the use of nuclear power - which accounts for 30 percent of its energy consumption .
the governing social democratic-green coalition considers nuclear power and the disposal of radioactive waste too dangerous .
germany moves towards regenerative energy the country has made efforts to move away from polluting fossil fuels and embrace alternative energies , in particular solar power .
at present , 7 percent of germany 's electricity is generated using alternative energy sources .
after the passing of the renewable energies law in april 2000 that sought to encourage a switch to renewable energies , germany experienced a sort of solar boom .
the southwestern city of freiburg boasts the first hotel in europe run entirely on alternative energy sources .
but despite the solar push , power from the sun today provides a mere 0,0006 percent of germany 's electricity .
wind and water another popular source of alternative energy in germany is hydroelectric power , which makes up more than half of alternative energy segment in the country .
but experts believe that hydroelectric power -lrb- photo -rrb- is pushing its limits and has already exhausted 80 percent of its potential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenwarte 2 in thueringen it has also become increasingly difficult to find large rivers in which to set up generators without the ecology of the region being adversely affected .
wind energy , once touted as the best form of alternative energy , today produces 3 percent of germany ’ s electricity .
but these huge wind fans throw equally large shadows and can be noisy .
increasing complaints about generators close to homes have led to a sharp drop in wind energy 's popularity .
in addition , experts think that the best windy places in the country are already taken up and the future of wind energy lies in offshore wind farms .
but there , production costs are high .
opposition could put up barriers the opposition union parties who look increasingly set to win the elections in september are reported to have made clear that they will not carry on with the proposed phasing-out of nuclear power set in motion by the current governing coalition .
they are also believed to be mainly interested in promoting biomass energy among the sources of renewable energy known in germany .
the economic spokesperson of the union parties , matthias wissmann , recently said in a statement that renewable energy was just too expensive to seriously consider pursuing .
but advocates of alternative energy argue that the slightly higher costs are worth the investment , especially if germany is to honour its commitment to the kyoto protocol and reduce its carbon emissions by 8 percent by 2010 .
coal is germany ’ s only major domestic fuel source and accounts for over 50 percent of electricity generation .
solar expert harald schützeichel said in an interview with der tagesspiegel newspaper on wednesday , " if we convert it into the electricity price , coal-driven plants cost us 0,5 cents while the subvention for renewable costs us 0,05 cents .
the central question is : do we want to keep the coal alive or do we want to promote a technology that makes sense .
and if we say that solar energy , wind and water make sense , then that ’ s where the money goes " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de environment becomes a political football in germany with half of germany submerged under water and elections looming , the environment has suddenly taken on a new urgency in the political campaign .

washington has indicated that foreign governments may lose us military aid if they do not co-operate .
washington has put huge pressure on yugoslavia to extradite its citizens to the hague , including the former president , slobodan milosevic the us argues that hostile countries may abuse the international court to bring politically motivated cases against american peacekeepers .
the us is at loggerheads with its european allies over whether american citizens should face international justice .
smoothed over those differences were papered over last month , when the united nations security council said us peacekeepers would be exempt from prosecution for a year .
this would give washington time to reach bilateral agreements with other countries not to extradite americans to the court .
but now a human rights group is accusing the bush administration of blackmail .
the group , human rights watch , says washington is threatening to cut off military aid to countries that do not toe the line .
double standards us secretary of state colin powell denied that washington was bludgeoning its friends .
but a state department official admitted that the us would be approaching countries one by one to ask them , as he put it , to respect america 's decision .
human rights activists are accusing the administration of double-standards .
washington has put huge pressure on yugoslavia to extradite its citizens to the hague , including the former president , slobodan milosevic .
but , the activists say , america does not want its own nationals to face the same kind of trial .

general musharraf accused what he called an insignificant minority of holding pakistan to ransom with their misconceived view of islam . "
my dear countrymen , your armed forces are standing guard on the country 's borders " president musharraf on kashmir he said a string of attacks on foreigners and christians this year were both despicable and shameful and the death of innocent people served only to tarnish the image of pakistan .
ahead of the speech , police in pakistan said they had arrested at least 16 suspected members of militant groups in a series of raids in punjab province .
a senior police official said those detained in the two-day operation included members of the outlawed militant groups , jaish-e-mohammad and lashkar-e-jhangvi .
both groups are suspected of involvement in last week 's attacks on a christian hospital in the northern town of taxila and a christian school in the town of murree , which left 10 people dead .
correspondents say the attacks have raised fears of a new wave of militancy aimed at christian and western targets .
the militant groups have been angered by pakistan 's support for the american-led war on terrorism , following the 11 september attacks on the united states .
in his speech - given entirely in english - general musharraf said pakistan 's authorities had a long-term strategy in place to deal with militant groups , many of which , he said had already been broken up .
kashmir elections security at the convention centre in islamabad where general musharraf made his address to the nation was extremely tight .
the bbc 's susannah price in islamabad says the recent upsurge in violence and its effect on international confidence will be one of the main challenges for the president in the months ahead .
the pakistani leader also used the speech to dismiss planned elections in indian-administered kashmir next month as a farce which denied the people of the disputed region a real choice .
" the announcement by india to hold elections in indian-occupied kashmir is yet another effort to give a mask of legitimacy to india 's illegal occupation of jammu and kashmir , " general musharraf said .
" the government of india has organised such farcical elections in the past as well .
these so-called elections have invariably been rigged and have always been boycotted by the kashmiri people , " he added .
he also pledged military support for the people of kashmir saying " my dear countrymen , your armed forces are standing guard on the country 's borders " .
" let life and business continue as usual with the confidence that your valiant forces have the jazba-e-eman -lsb- spirit of faith -rsb- not only to defend every inch of the motherland but to carry the fight across the border , " he added .
an indian spokesman described the remarks as " provocative " and aimed at raising tension in the region .
amid continuing tensions between india and pakistan over the disputed kashmir territory the two nuclear powers have amassed more than one million troops on the border .

the company , which last month expanded its network on the mainland with the acquisition of eight local operators , said it now had 105.4 million users , nosing ahead of britain 's vodafone , which has 103.8 million worldwide .

thousands of villagers in north kent turned up to a meeting on tuesday evening , just 24 hours after neighbours of stansted airport in essex made their opposition clear at another public meeting .
the government has drawn up a shortlist of areas in which to expand or build airports to cope with the rising demand for flights .

thousands of villagers from allhallows and st mary hoo arrived at the open air meeting on tuesday .
allhallows ward councillor chris buckwell said 1,100 homes could be bought up to make way for the airport .
he said : " all these people are due to have their houses demolished .
the airport will take out the whole of allhallows village and most of st mary hoo village and most of two other villages .
" people were betrayed because they were short listed without any consultation in what we consider to be an undemocratic and secret process . "
opponents hope the site 's conservation credentials as a wetland site of international importance will help keep it off the shortlist .
in stansted , where another three runways could be built , residents packed out a school hall on monday evening to make their views known .
house prices have already been affected by the proposals , which would mean 200 homes , 64 grade-ii listed buildings and hundreds of acres of countryside would be lost .
saffron walden mp sir alan haselhurst told bbc london : " these people have lived here all their lives and do n't want to see their area changed in such a dramatic fashion .

israeli authorities arrested mr barghouti in april during an israeli incursion into the west bank in response to palestinian suicide attacks on israeli targets . "
security will only be achieved in one way , by peace , and peace will only be achieved by the end of the occupation " marwan barghouti the hearing in a small courtroom in tel aviv lasted only 20 minutes before the judge set a trial date of 5 september .
if convicted , he faces life in prison .
mr barghouti , handcuffed and dressed in a brown israeli prison uniform , was defiant throughout proceedings .
his lawyer objected when the prosecutor read out the charges .
the judge silenced mr barghouti when he stood up and said in hebrew that he wanted to present a list of 50 charges against israel for its occupation of palestinian territories .
before the start of the trial mr barghouti told reporters that israel would only find security by ending the occupation of palestinian territories .
" i am a peaceful man , " he said .
" i was trying to do everything for peace between the two peoples .
" i believe the best solution is two states for two peoples ...
security will only be achieved in one way , by peace , and peace will only be achieved by the end of the occupation . "
lawyers acting for mr barghouti say he denies the charges linking him to al-aqsa martyrs brigades - a militant offshoot of yasser arafat 's fatah movement which has claimed responsibility for numerous suicide attacks against israel .
fiery speechmaker mr barghouti is the west bank leader of the fatah movement and the tanzim militia .
he is one of the most visible leaders of the palestinian intifada , known for delivering bellicose speeches to crowds of palestinians during the early days of the violent uprising that began in september 2000 .
mr barghouti insists he is only a politician .
one of his lawyers , khader shkirat said : " he describes his role as that of a political leader , and leader of the uprising , but he does not consider himself responsible for the killings of israelis . "
but israel accuses him of orchestrating terrorist attacks on israelis by al-aqsa members .
israel 's justice ministry said mr barghouti was the " central partner in the decisions made by organisations that in the last two years carried out a series of attacks that claimed the lives of scores of israeli citizens and wounded hundreds " .
torture allegations israeli officials have claimed that mr barghouti admitted his role in the attacks during questioning , a charge his lawyers deny .
mr shkirat accuses israel 's authorities of interrogating mr barghouti around the clock following his arrest - allowing him to only sleep two hours a night and then only in a chair with his hands tied .
experts say that israel will use the trial as a chance to convince the world that the palestinian authority is a terrorist organisation .
but mr shkirat says " this is a golden opportunity to try the -lrb- israeli -rrb- occupation for all the crimes committed against the palestinian people , and to present the resistance movement as a just movement before the israeli public and the international community " .

security will only be achieved in one way , by peace , and peace will only be achieved by the end of the occupation marwan barghouti the hearing in a small courtroom in tel aviv lasted only 20 minutes before the judge set a trial date of 5 september .
if convicted , he faces life in prison .
mr barghouti , handcuffed and dressed in a brown israeli prison uniform , was defiant throughout proceedings .
his lawyer objected when the prosecutor read out the charges .
the judge silenced mr barghouti when he stood up and said in hebrew that he wanted to present a list of 50 charges against israel for its occupation of palestinian territories .
before the start of the trial mr barghouti told reporters that israel would only find security by ending the occupation of palestinian territories .
" i am a peaceful man , " he said .
" i was trying to do everything for peace between the two peoples .
" i believe the best solution is two states for two peoples ...
security will only be achieved in one way , by peace , and peace will only be achieved by the end of the occupation . "
lawyers acting for mr barghouti say he denies the charges linking him to al-aqsa martyrs brigades - a militant offshoot of yasser arafat 's fatah movement which has claimed responsibility for numerous suicide attacks against israel .
fiery speechmaker mr barghouti is the west bank leader of the fatah movement and the tanzim militia .
he is one of the most visible leaders of the palestinian intifada , known for delivering bellicose speeches to crowds of palestinians during the early days of the violent uprising that began in september 2000 .
mr barghouti insists he is only a politician .
israel says barghouti is a militant leader one of his lawyers , khader shkirat said : " he describes his role as that of a political leader , and leader of the uprising , but he does not consider himself responsible for the killings of israelis . "
but israel accuses him of orchestrating terrorist attacks on israelis by al-aqsa members .
israel 's justice ministry said mr barghouti was the " central partner in the decisions made by organisations that in the last two years carried out a series of attacks that claimed the lives of scores of israeli citizens and wounded hundreds " .
torture allegations israeli officials have claimed that mr barghouti admitted his role in the attacks during questioning , a charge his lawyers deny .
mr shkirat accuses israel 's authorities of interrogating mr barghouti around the clock following his arrest - allowing him to only sleep two hours a night and then only in a chair with his hands tied .
experts say that israel will use the trial as a chance to convince the world that the palestinian authority is a terrorist organisation .
but mr shkirat says " this is a golden opportunity to try the -lrb- israeli -rrb- occupation for all the crimes committed against the palestinian people , and to present the resistance movement as a just movement before the israeli public and the international community " . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jeremy cooke " he 's a serious player in the complex world of palestinian politics " key stories israel 's early elections bombs and labour israel seeks us cash hamas resurgent profiles ariel sharon binyamin netanyahu amram mitzna yasser arafat factfile voices from the conflict talking point what will stop the suicide bombings ?

a trial of ' broadband-in-a-box ' could mean that areas with small populations can join in the broadband revolution that has so far eluded them .
getting broadband to areas outside of main towns and cities has become the hottest potato surrounding adsl - high-speed access via the telephone line .
bt has always insisted it was only economically viable to roll out broadband to areas with between 200 and 400 customers due to the cost of adsl-enabling a telephone exchange , which it estimates at between a quarter and half a million pounds .
mini-broadband it is now planning to trial a scaled-down version of the standard adsl equipment which will mean as few as 16 customers can be connected to the technology .
campaign group broadband4britain has always disputed bt 's figures , claiming that adsl can be rolled out to exchanges with just 50 customers .
the news is a vindication of its stance said campaign manager andy williams , although he is not convinced bt is doing anything new .
" my feeling is that this is not so much to do with new technology , but a more pragmatic roll-out of existing technology combined with a more aggressive market stance , " he said .

bt is asking sponsors to contribute £ 7,000 to the trial , although the telecoms giant was unable to say what the total cost of enabling the exchanges would be .
so far seven sponsors have come forward , including the highlands and islands enterprise , the east of england development agency and the new forest business partnership .
big break ?
the sponsors will team up with an internet service provider of their choice .
after the six month trial , bt will decide whether to permanently adsl-enable the exchange involved in the experiment .
however it has given no indication of how much money it would expect sponsors to pay after the trial period .
" we will see how it develops and how the business model works out but it is important to stress that at this time it is just a trial , " said a spokesman for bt .
mr ferguson said the trial could be the breakthrough rural residents have been waiting for .
" it is quite a big change and could mean that small towns at last get broadband , " he said .
but it is far too early to say if it will outlast the trial .
" it could be something that disappears after six months if bt decides it is n't worth it . "
mr ferguson estimated that initial services could cost up to £ 30 although some of the sponsors may choose to offer it free in order to get users interested in the technology .

not so , argues online marketing expert derick hill .
advertisers just have to change the way they work , he writes .
apart from wobbly wheels on my supermarket trolley , i find nothing more annoying than a barrage of unwanted and irrelevant ads appearing before , during and after a visit to my favourite website .
but it is not usually the format that annoys me .
what does annoy me is that fact that the ads are not what i came for , bear no relation to my interests and are wasting my valuable time .
and i am going to ignore them .
so they are doing me no good and certainly doing the advertiser who is paying for them , and the site that is showing them , no good either .
but it does not have to be like that .
enter permission marketing .
happy consumers the principles behind permission marketing are nothing new .
it is all about the advertiser creating a relationship with the consumer and understanding them and their interests .
ask the consumer for permission to communicate with them by showing them adverts and listen and respond to their comments .
make sure you show them things they are going to be interested in , at a time and in a format they are happy with .
finally the successful advertiser recognises and rewards the consumer for their attention .
instant data this can be remarkably successful online .
take a simple site like www.thedailydraw.com where players specify their interest areas and play a free £ 1m lottery every day in return for seeing ads and special offers on their selected subjects .
the reason sites like this are able to make online advertising work is because they really exploit the internet 's advantages in producing a genuine win-win situation .
the advertisers are happy to pay for an attentive and receptive audience and the consumers are being respected and rewarded for looking at an advert they are actually interested in seeing .
the internet 's greatest strength for a marketer is its ability to provide a wealth of instant consumer behaviour data .
it is the advertising industry 's responsibility to collect that data , use it to understand consumers and construct products and advertising campaigns that match their changing needs .
only when we in the online advertising business have addressed the problem of relevance should we begin to address the problem of creative interpretation .
so , i do not mind if i see an ad in a skyscraper form or as a pop-up .
but in an ideal world , it appears just before i am about to go to the supermarket and offers me an instant wobbly wheel fixer kit .
