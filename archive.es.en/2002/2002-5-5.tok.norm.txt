men were slightly better informed than women , but even so , 24 % said they had no idea how much they needed for retirement , and 15 % guessed it was between £ 100,000 and £ 200,000 .
divided by age , those between 16 and 24 emerged as being most in the dark , with 36 % having no idea how much they needed , and 14 % thinking between £ 20,000 and £ 50,000 would be sufficient .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- eyewitness : albania 's blood feuds categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : europe front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 5 may , 2002 , 06:43 gmt 07:43 uk eyewitness : albania 's blood feuds marc emur fears for his life because of a blood feud by the bbc 's mike donkin in northern albania there are 72 people in what the laciy family call their " tribe " .
they live in the beautiful mountains of northern albania , but for nearly four years they have not dared stray beyond the gates of their yard because a " gjakmarrya " - a blood feud - has been declared against them .
one of their sons killed a man and so , under an ancient code revived in these remote valleys , the victim 's family must take revenge against any of the killer 's male relatives .
it means the women must farm the land and that even a 10-month-old boy , born " locked in " , will eventually be a target unless the feud is resolved .
so cousins zecir and gentian , who are 16 , can not go to school or play football with their friends .
zecir laciy could be killed if he leaves his house " if we went outside these walls we know they 'd find us with their guns , " zecir says .
" this is no life for us .
maybe we can escape to europe illegally . "
indoors and out of the line of fire the men are smoking and drinking raki as they meet with a team of peace missionaries who are trying to broker an end to the feud .
the killer 's father , lan laciy , says he prays they succeed .
" our enemies have punished us enough .
none of us men can work " he says .
" we are already ruined as a tribe . "
huge task the missionaries , who are funded by britain 's catholic agency for overseas development -lrb- cafod -rrb- , have a huge task on their hands .
this is one of hundreds of blood feuds which are blighting the lives of thousands of people in albania .
" we have to change peoples ' mentality here , " the missionaries ' leader emin spahia says .
peace missionaries negotiate with local men " but we know it wo n't be easy because we are asking them to set aside traditions they have upheld for 600 years . "
those traditions are based on the kanun law drawn up in the 15th century by feudal leader lek dugajine .
his code states that if one man kills another " blood should always be avenged by blood " and lays down precise rules for how .
kanun law was suppressed by albania 's harsh communist regime but revived when it collapsed in 1991 because in the mountains the laws of the weak new government are rarely enforced .
state security director neritan cekas insists the authorities are doing all they can to stamp out blood feuds .
" we have seized many weapons , " he says .
" and we tell citizens that this traditional law should now be just history .
bad impression " blood feud killings give a very bad impression of our country - especially at a time when albania wants to attract more foreign investors and we hope to join the european union . "
the government is relying on the peace missionaries to intervene where it can not by holding a series of village meetings in the north where the whole community is urged to " swear to abstain " from blood feuds .
these can become emotional gatherings .
in kelmend , missionary emin spahija held up a file of pictures of children , all of whose fathers were murdered under the kanun .
" set the code aside , " he pleaded .
" it brings only pain . "
villagers are shown images of fatherless children one villager asked , " why should we ?
when the state is not doing its job in punishing the guilty . "
another shouted : " it is not for the state to forgive my son 's killer .
that is for me to decide . "
kelmend 's villagers did finally vote " yes " to setting up a pilot zone where blood feuds will be outlawed - but the show of hands was far from unanimous .
after the meeting we tested the mood by calling on both sides in one bitter feud .
we called first on ardiana preka , whose husband was killed and whose men folk have sworn to avenge him .
after feeding the animals with her children ardiana went to put a fresh rose on their father 's shrine .
' hard to forgive ' we asked her : did she too want more blood spilled ?
" in these matters the women do not decide that " she said .
" but it will be hard for our men to forgive . "
we then crossed the village to the house of the man who killed ardiana 's husband and then fled .
behind the steel railings the women and the daughters of the emur family dug vegetables .
on the porch marc emur , who is 70 , cleaned his hunting rifle .
ardiana preka visits her husband 's shrine " for now i must be ready , " he said .
" but we ask the preka tribe to forgive us so that all of our children and all of theirs can grow up without their lives being threatened .
one day all this must end . "
finally we took that plea back to the preka 's farm .
prek preka , the father of the feud victim , would not talk long about the duty to kill by which he is now bound .
he said simply , " these are necessary things . "
in the mountains of northern albania when it comes to a choice between a nation 's progress and a family 's honour - for now there is little contest .
the old ways prevail .

the iran newspaper , which is owned by the official irna news agency , was suspended on saturday , believed to have been accused of blasphemy .
irna said the head of the iranian judiciary , ayatollah mohmoud hashemi shahroudi , issued an order on sunday reversing the injunction .
the temporary ban was the latest in a crackdown on reformist media by hardline rivals of iran 's moderate president mohammed khatami .
no reason was given for the paper 's suspension , although a bbc regional analyst says it is likely to do with a recent article which iranian religious authorities said insulted the prophet mohammed .
last week , the newspaper published an item which suggested the prophet enjoyed listening to women sing and play music .
women singing before a male audience is considered un-islamic in iran , which banned such activities two years ago .
the head of the newspaper , abdol rassul vessal , said the publication was closed after 96 complaints against it .
press battleground the judiciary also shut down another liberal newspaper , bonyan , to which writers of banned publications frequently contribute .
it is not known whether the order against bonyan will also be reversed .
the iranian press has become one of the main battlegrounds between conservative hardliners and president khatami .
more than 80 publications supporting the president have been shut down over the past two years and dozens of reformist campaigners jailed .

royal protection police must first approve all security arrangements in stadiums in the far east before the trip will get the go-ahead .
the princes are said to have won support for the trip from their father , prince charles , after a difficult start to the year with the deaths of the queen mother and princess margaret .
the sunday express newspaper has reported that the princes intend to travel to saitama for england 's match against sweden .
the princes ' personal bodyguards are reported by the newspaper to be in discussions with the football association .
the princes are keen sportsmen they are preparing a dossier of the safety implications of the trip , fa sources are said to have revealed .
the issues they are looking into include venues for the princes ' stay and any potential threats from terrorist attacks .
an fa source told the newspaper : " we have been told to cater for all eventualities and that includes a visit by the princes .
" both lads , particularly william , are massively popular in the far east where they are treated like pop stars - that alone creates a security headache .
" the logistics of a visit are mind-boggling because it is not simply a case of arriving , watching a game and going .
" the boys are ambassadors for the royal family and have also got to meet some diplomats out there . "
other logistics of the trip include taking time away from their studies - william is at st andrew 's university and harry at eton .
as president of the fa prince andrew will attend the world cup prince william could catch up on his studies in his own time , while prince harry is reported to have a half-term break in the first week of june .
they are also due to be in britain for the queen 's golden jubilee celebrations .
but they will be keen to meet all their obligations and fit in a visit to the world cup - they travelled with their father to watch england play colombia in lens in the 1998 competition .
that decision defied advice from both the royal protection squad and the fa 's own security department due to the high risk of hooliganism because it was the closest venue to britain .
security chiefs are said to have learned valuable lessons from the experience and intend to keep these in mind for any similar trips to this year 's world cup .
the princes are renowned for their love of sport and william is an aston villa fan , and has been spied on occasion at villa park .
the princes ' uncle , the duke of york , will definitely be attending the world cup finals and is due to fly into the opening ceremony before travelling on to watch england take on sweden .

the state-owned postal operator rebranded itself as consignia over the last couple of years to gear up for the loss of its monopoly of uk postal delivery services .
but the new name has failed to catch on and consignia chairman allan leighton has confirmed it is to go - " probably in less than two years . "
in with the old ?
" there 's not really a commercial reason to do it , but there 's a credibility reason to do it , " he told bbc tv 's breakfast with frost programme .
as to the likely replacement , he said the firm has several strong brands from its past which are held in affection by the public .
the rebranding was " unfortunate " because it had coincided with a period of underperfomance by the firm - which lost £ 1.5m a day during one-three month period last year .
mr leighton declined to comment on press speculation that the government is seeking a replacment for consignia 's chief executive , john roberts .
shake-up the financial times newspaper reported last week that the government wanted to give the job to someone with an " entrepreneurial " background .
loss-making consignia is mid-way through a radical restructuring programme aimed at shedding up to 30,000 jobs and closing a third of the urban post office network .
mr leighton agreed that 30,000 job losses - a figure set out by mr roberts - was " indicative " and a " realistic " target .
mr leighton said he had told a recent meeting of 150 " top managers " that one third of them could expect to lose their jobs .
billy hayes of the communication workers union told breakfast with frost the union was willing to accept voluntary redundancies and called for more investment in the postal service .
" we 're up for change , -lrb- but -rrb- that change has got to be negotiated , " he said .
strike averted more than 70 % of the uk population would support an increase in the cost of stamps to protect the postal service , he said .
consignia has been hit hard in recent years by competition in some segments of the postal services market , and by declining mail volumes linked to the rise of electronic communication .
the company has also been dogged by labour disputes .
on thursday , a national postal workers ' strike planned for 8 may was narrowly averted when consignia reached a preliminary agreement over pay with the communication workers ' union -lrb- cwu -rrb- .
under the deal , which still requires the backing of cwu members , consignia staff would be given a 2.2 % pay rise backdated to october last year , and a further 2.3 % from october 2002 .
under the government 's plans to liberalise postal services , the company 's monopoly would be dismantled in three phases by 2006 .

they are warning that the restrictions will increase if the severe water shortage continues .

arsenal walked away with the sport 's most prestigious trophy after defeating fellow londoners chelsea two-nil . "
the result was a great day for football supporters and a great day for cardiff " chief superintendent jeff cooksley police arrangements for the marshalling of 70,000 visiting fans passed off like clockwork , with no arrests inside the millennium stadium and only five throughout the day a sophisticated operation - rehearsed when arsenal lost to liverpool last season - saw rival groups of fans directed off the m4 motorway at separate locations .
a large part of central cardiff was shut off with road into the city quiet from about midday as fans arrived early for the match .
seven thousand fans arrived by train with services doubled and a special control system introduced to avoid fricton .
some arsenal fans chartered a jumbo plane to cut the journey from london to wales to just 25 minutes , while others arrived by helicopter .
chief superintendentt jeff cooksley of south wales police said : " i was impressed with the behaviour of both sets of fans .
" i am also delighted that everyone listened to the advice to come early .
" the result was a great day for football supporters and a great day for cardiff . "
just five arrests were made throughout the day .
the atmosphere in the city centre after the game was relaxed as jubilant arsenal and disappointed chelsea supporters poured out of the millennium stadium .
restaurants and cafe owners were counting their takings after a bumper day .
one , tony vendito of topo gigi , said he could have filled his restaurant two or three times over .
" the atmosphere had been good , " he said .
" different from on rugby internationals but its has been good all the same . "
it is the second year running that the millennium stadium - taking over the prize from the defunct wembley stadium - has hosted the glamour event with its worldwide tv audience of 2.5 billion .
the coup of staging the major footballing tournament has secured the position of the cardiff stadium as the premier venue for showpiece matches .
but the mystery " jinx " which appears to affect teams using the ground 's southern changing room continues .
chelsea , despite wearing their lucky white socks , yesterday became the tenth consecutive side to lose a major final after using the changing room .
