mother-of-triplets ann daniels and film financier caroline hamilton finished their long-haul hike on sunday 0600 bst to become the first women to walk to both poles .
in january 2000 , along with three other women , they walked to the south pole .
it was excruciating ... at times it was really difficult to put one foot in front of the other ann daniels ms hamilton , 35 , from spitalfields , central london , told the bbc that there were times when it was very hard but they never considered giving up .
" there were moments when it was really , really tough and i thought , ' this is ghastly ' , but i never wanted to give up , " she said .
she said what drove them was that they had made it to the south pole together .
there were three women in the team when it set off but pom oliver , 50 - who was a member of the south pole expedition - was forced to quit on day 47 with frostbitten feet .
since leaving ward hunt island in northern canada on march 12 , ms hamilton and ms daniels - 37 , from whimple in devon - have each pulled a 250lb -lrb- 113kg -rrb- sledge of food and equipment .
reaching the south pole in january 2000 ms daniels said afterwards : " it was excruciating ... at times it was really difficult to put one foot in front of the other . "
rapidly warming temperatures and melting ice had made the trip a race against time .
just two weeks ago fellow british walker , davie mill , had to be airlifted off after melting ice stopped him halfway into his 376-mile trip .
detours around ice holes had already stretched a trip that is 413 miles as the crow flies into 750 miles . watch / listen on this story british trekker ann daniels " it 's an absolutely wonderful feeling " see also : 23 may 02 -pipe- england race against time for polar women 07 apr 02 -pipe- england blizzards delay women 's polar trek 11 mar 02 -pipe- england women 's polar trek delayed 01 mar 02 -pipe- england three aim for polar glory 11 jan 02 -pipe- england female trio aim for polar double 06 may 01 -pipe- uk uk trio set polar records 24 jan 00 -pipe- uk polar double for british women internet links : the arctic circle expedition website -lrb- m & g investment -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top england stories now : 10,000 chased for congestion fine teenagers admit festival violence postmaster sacked over robbery beckham forgives ferguson man faces nine rape charges abuse claimants win compensation 400 jobs to go at zinc works legal row cat back with owners links to more england stories are at the foot of the page .

this is the year that mobile operators and handset makers are working hard to convince consumers to swap their existing phone for one that can handle forthcoming data services .
they are keen to get existing customers signing up and spending more on the new services because new subscribers are suddenly proving hard to find .
but experts are divided over whether the phones will prove popular and if operators will be able to squeeze more money out of their customers .
cost curse simon east , former head of technology at handheld software maker symbian , doubts that the most advanced handsets , which combine a handheld computer and phone , will be best sellers .
" these phones are far too complicated for the mass market user , " he said .
roy bedlow , spokesman for handheld maker handspring was more upbeat .
" the vision we have is that all organisers in the future will be connected , " he said .
" all devices and organisers in this class will have radio in them . "
handspring has just launched the treo 270 which combines both phone and pda into one package .
but the relatively high cost of these futuristic handsets and handhelds could put people off .
phones that have colour screens , polyphonic ringtones , cameras and can send long text messages and swap images are likely to cost around £ 200 when they go on sale .
handhelds are typically even more expensive .
businesses may use smartphones because they could easily tie them into their corporate computer networks , said mr east , but most consumers were happy making calls and sending text messages .
tight fit mr east is now head of cognima which makes software to help people co-ordinate address books across several different devices .
only when the new services were tightly integrated into a handset and were easy to use would phone firms see lots of people signing up , said mr east .
one thing is clear .
no phone operators want to repeat the miserable experience everyone had with wap - the phone data service that was over-hyped , over-sold and over , almost before it began .
" people had a really bad experience with wap , " said gilles babinet , head of mobile music firm musiwave .
" people bought wap because they thought they would have the internet on their phone .
but they did n't and people are really reluctant to go through that again , " he said .
although now almost every new phone can use wap , few mention it in as a selling point .
instead , said mr babinet , it is being used as a hidden system for delivering new services .
" we can not repeat the wap story , " he cautioned .
" the whole industry has to be really focussed on real experiences for the user . "
almost all the mobile phone operators are improving the ability of their networks to handle data using a technology called general packet radio service .
so far take-up of these services has been lacklustre , perhaps because of bad wap memories .
now , instead of relying on people to find data services for themselves , many mobile operators are embedding game and ringtone replacement services into phones to get people using them .
what needs to be sorted out is a way of securing the polyphonic ringtones , images and even video clips that people are going to be buying and downloading .
if people start sharing ringtones and images instead of paying for them , the plans of the operators to reap rewards from new data services could stumble .
" if we are going into the napster mode , we will not have a business model , " he said .

former bbc boss birt - appointed by tony blair to look at transport policy - is understood to have suggested a network of " premium " toll roads to be built alongside existing motorways .
i do n't think there is much sympathy for building a whole new network of motorways around the country alistair darling but mr darling said there was not enough room in the uk for significant new road-building .
he told the sunday telegraph : " britain is n't big enough for us to be pouring more and more concrete over its green and pleasant land .
' refocus ' " i have n't yet had a chance to speak to john since i was appointed , but i do n't think there is much sympathy for building a whole new network of motorways around the country . "
mr darling : regarded as a safe pair of hands mr darling denied that he intended to scrap his predecessor john prescott 's 10-year plan for transport , which was attacked last week by the commons transport committee .
the prime minister had asked him to look at the plan and " decide whether we needed to do more in some areas or refocus in others " , mr darling told the paper .
but he added : " what i am not going to do is tear everything up . "
congestion in an interview with the financial times on saturday , mr darling indicated the he may have to get tough with motorists in a bid to cut traffic congestion .
he said : " it 's simply not possible to have more and more traffic on streets designed hundreds of years ago for horses and carts .
" people say you must be anti-car then .
that 's nonsense .

former bbc boss birt - appointed by tony blair to look at transport policy - is understood to have suggested a network of " premium " toll roads to be built alongside existing motorways . "
i do n't think there is much sympathy for building a whole new network of motorways around the country " alistair darling but mr darling said there was not enough room in the uk for significant new road-building .
he told the sunday telegraph : " britain is n't big enough for us to be pouring more and more concrete over its green and pleasant land .
' refocus ' " i have n't yet had a chance to speak to john since i was appointed , but i do n't think there is much sympathy for building a whole new network of motorways around the country . "
mr darling denied that he intended to scrap his predecessor john prescott 's 10-year plan for transport , which was attacked last week by the commons transport committee .
the prime minister had asked him to look at the plan and " decide whether we needed to do more in some areas or refocus in others " , mr darling told the paper .
but he added : " what i am not going to do is tear everything up . "
congestion in an interview with the financial times on saturday , mr darling indicated the he may have to get tough with motorists in a bid to cut traffic congestion .
he said : " it 's simply not possible to have more and more traffic on streets designed hundreds of years ago for horses and carts .
" people say you must be anti-car then .
that 's nonsense .
i drive a car .

many here have waited for as long as 36 hours to cross the israeli army checkpoint which cuts the north of the gaza strip from the south . "
i feel trapped , as if i 'm in prison " nicola fanous german-born resident of gaza young and old , they have slept in their seats or in the sand beside their cars .
an elderly woman from rafah had a heart attack at the abu holi checkpoint ; a pregnant woman gave birth to a baby that died .
for gazans , the checkpoint is a symbol of the bitter humiliation of the israeli occupation .
students , truck drivers , civil servants all wait for hour after hour , as the israeli army closes off the main north-south road whenever a jewish settler living in gush katif , a block of seaside settlements , wants to pass .
" i ca n't bear it anymore , " said 52-year old saliya , her eyes red with tears .
" i have diabetes and high blood pressure and i 've been here since yesterday , squashed with all the men in this crowded taxi with nowhere to go to the toilet . "
the restrictions - which israeli officials describe as necessary security measures - are devastating the palestinian economy and feeding deep and dangerous frustrations .
kept apart " this is one of the biggest oppressions of the occupation , " says a 22-year-old student at the islamic university in gaza city , playing cards with a group of friends in the sand as he waits to cross the checkpoint .
" it 's a thousand times better to go to israel and blow yourself up and go to heaven than living like this . "
to thwart would-be suicide bombers , israel has sealed off gaza with fences and checkpoints , locking the palestinians in .
since the beginning of the uprising in september 2000 , gazans have not been allowed to travel to the west bank .
" i have n't seen my students in 20 months , " says ziad abu amar , a professor at the west bank university of birzeit and a member of the palestinian legislative council , which has not convened properly in months .
" now we ca n't even hold sessions through video-conferencing because members from the west bank ca n't meet in one place any more , " mr abu amar says .
" these movement restrictions are hindering our work in the legislative council and undermining our efforts to nourish a democratic process here . "
they are also affecting ziad abu amar 's personal life , preventing him from seeing his two daughters who live in the west bank .
no exceptions even foreign women married to palestinians , who have residency in gaza , have now found themselves confined to the tiny , impoverished territory .
" i feel trapped , as if i 'm in prison , " says nicola fanous , a german who met her gaza-born husband in berlin in the 1980s .
the couple settled in gaza after the 1993 peace treaty between israel and the palestinians .
nicola , who works for the united nations , wants to visit friends and relatives back home .
but israel , which last year destroyed the radar at gaza airport and dug up its runway , will not let the german passport-holder cross into israeli territory to fly out .
she says the authorities have informed the german embassy that she is not " an urgent humanitarian case " .
nicola believes there are hundreds of women like her - married to palestinians in gaza and now subjected to the same restrictions as them .
" there 's nothing here but home and work and work and home , " she says .
" it 's depressing enough without knowing that you ca n't leave . "
