the international force has successfully prevented civil war between slavic and albanian parts of the macedonian population . in the past decade of balkan crises , the international community often waited too long before it intervened militarily , deciding to do so only after many lives and livelihoods had been lost .
but there 's one balkan region where early nato intervention successfully helped avert war : macedonia .
last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .
its mission is to oversee the peace process .
in addition , the nato force protects international monitors who keep an eye on the return of macedonian refugees to areas that were held by ethnic albanian rebels last year .
a fragile peace the peace in macedonia is still extremely fragile .
it would not hold if nato pulled out any time soon .
research conducted by the u.s. department of state revealed that 87 percent of the people in macedonia have little confidence in the peace accord .
" it 's obvious that the accord has n't satisfied the albanians and that they have more ambitious plans when they think of macedonia , " the regional dnevnik newspaper commented , echoing a common sentiment .
there 's concern among nato peacekeepers in macedonia that extremists will rekindle hatred among the slavic and albanian macedonians during the upcoming election campaign .
macedonians will go to the polls on september 15 – and the campaign is already dominated by nationalist overtones .
after taking over command of " amber fox " this week , dutch general jan harm de jonge said he expects increased tension ahead of the elections .
" it is part of politics , " de jonge said .
macedonia important for the dutch when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became the country 's highest-profile military operation since the bosnian war of the 1990s .
dutch general de jonge is under extreme pressure : if he does well in macedonia , he could help heal the wounds holland suffered in that conflict .
in 1995 , dutch peacekeepers were unable to prevent a massacre in the srebrenica enclave .
bosnian serbs slaughtered up to 8,000 muslim men and boys and all the dutch peacekeepers could do was look the other way because they did not have a mandate to engage in combat .
to this day , feelings of guilt over srebrenica weigh heavily on the dutch .
earlier this year , the dutch government resigned after historians published a damning report about the massacre .
the report condemned politicians and the military for sending the dutch troops to the enclave on what it said was an impossible mission .
when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became its highest-profile military operation since srebrenica .
at the handover ceremony for operation " amber fox " , dutch general de jonge was asked if taking on new responsibility in macedonia was an attempt to rehabilitate the dutch military 's reputation .
but de jonge was reluctant to get deeper into the issue .
" i have nothing to do with that , " the general said .
" i 'm here to perform a mission ... and that 's what i have been trained to do . "
the dutch may be the last nation to command the nato mission in macedonia .
in october , the european union plans to take over from nato .
it would be the first time in history that the eu launches a peacekeeping mission – and a test case for the block 's common approach to foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr to say bye to the balkans the german defence minister announced that the number of german soldiers stationed in the balkans will be reduced this year , just as the parliament extended the german peacekeeping mission in macedonia .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .
michael verhaeghe , one of the lawyers for the group of palestinians , said his clients would take the case to belgium ’ s supreme court of appeal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.06.2002 leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch - his media empire is crumbling , but he 's still fighting the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire . media mogul leo kirch on wednesday moved to take action against long-standing rival axel springer verlag by seeking an independent investigation into a controversial put option that springer insisted on exercising in a move that kirch blames for causing the collapse of his empire .
kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .

hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .

-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .

" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .

the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .
a german world cup win would favor the incumbent gerhard schröder , who is likely praying hard for a victory these days , since poll numbers just out show his spd party trailing the opposition . dirk vogel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one world around football far from being the polarised victims of disintegrating society , the world cup has showed that we still enjoy each other ’ s company and that the language of football talks sense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.06.2002 leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch - his media empire is crumbling , but he 's still fighting the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire . media mogul leo kirch on wednesday moved to take action against long-standing rival axel springer verlag by seeking an independent investigation into a controversial put option that springer insisted on exercising in a move that kirch blames for causing the collapse of his empire .
kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .
money for decommissioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as part of the deal , russia is also to receive $ 20 billion -lrb- 20.29 billion euro -rrb- for the decommissioning of its weapons of mass destruction .

" this threat is not over yet .

tacke of the german finance ministry described the project as a holdover from the cold war era .
" there 's a collective responsibility for all countries to contribute , " he said .
" by increasing security in this area and supporting efforts to destroy hazardous materials , we 're also contributing to our own security , " he said .

u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .
but he has succeeded in making the war against terrorism the political octopus of the meeting , with tentacles reaching into virtually every theme on the agenda - from safeguarding and decommissioning russian weapons to eradicating poverty in africa , which the g8 leaders believe fuels political instability and terrorism . on wednesday , the g8 also agreed to cooperate on new airline and air freight security measures in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks , including better sharing of passenger lists , securing cockpit doors , and making it more difficult for terrorists to transport dangerous materials .
on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .

but critics say the programs on the table provide too little , too late . it 's about 11 a.m. in calgary .
eight young men in soccer uniforms are wearing enormous masks of the leaders of the g8 countries , who are meeting about one hour away in the mountain outpost of kananaskis for their annual summit .
the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .
the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .
but these men are mainly here to protest current aid proposals being discussed by the g8 for africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " africa is giving the eight heads of state a yellow card , " says jörn kalinski of the international aid organization oxfam germany .
" the purpose of this meeting is to adopt an action plan for africa .
but from everything we 've heard , it 's only going to be peanuts that they decide on here .
it wo n't be nearly enough . "
the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .
africans helping africans help themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this money could also help the five african countries planning to introduce the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- in kananaski .
the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .
schröder pledges support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder offered his support for the nepad initiative in an editorial published on wednesday in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " we need a more intensive partnership with africa , " schröder wrote .
he pledged that germany would bilaterally forgive 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.95 billion -rrb- to african countries and an additional 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- in multiladeral debt as part of its efforts to support the initiative .
additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .
" but it 's also correct that the g8 and the rich countries in general do too little for africa .
now they 're talking about a billion dollars .
take a look at the world bank 's action plan .
in order to ensure that every child in the world has access to a school education by 2015 , they predict it will cost $ 10 to 15 billion annually .
then you can see that a billion is nowhere near enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are drugs firms exploiting aids ?
more than 20 million people have died of aids since the epidemic began .
pharmaceutical companies are concerned with their profit margins and do not want to give treatments away at reduced costs , sparking an international debate over ethics .
war on terror likely to dominate g8 summit the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .
other issues like free trade and a aid for africa could be overshadowed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .

the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .
a german world cup win would favor the incumbent gerhard schröder , who is likely praying hard for a victory these days , since poll numbers just out show his spd party trailing the opposition . dirk vogel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one world around football far from being the polarised victims of disintegrating society , the world cup has showed that we still enjoy each other ’ s company and that the language of football talks sense .

such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .

the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .
a german world cup win would favor the incumbent gerhard schröder , who is likely praying hard for a victory these days , since poll numbers just out show his spd party trailing the opposition . dirk vogel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one world around football far from being the polarised victims of disintegrating society , the world cup has showed that we still enjoy each other ’ s company and that the language of football talks sense .

the international force has successfully prevented civil war between slavic and albanian parts of the macedonian population . in the past decade of balkan crises , the international community often waited too long before it intervened militarily , deciding to do so only after many lives and livelihoods had been lost .
but there 's one balkan region where early nato intervention successfully helped avert war : macedonia .
last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .
its mission is to oversee the peace process .
in addition , the nato force protects international monitors who keep an eye on the return of macedonian refugees to areas that were held by ethnic albanian rebels last year .
a fragile peace the peace in macedonia is still extremely fragile .
it would not hold if nato pulled out any time soon .
research conducted by the u.s. department of state revealed that 87 percent of the people in macedonia have little confidence in the peace accord .
" it 's obvious that the accord has n't satisfied the albanians and that they have more ambitious plans when they think of macedonia , " the regional dnevnik newspaper commented , echoing a common sentiment .
there 's concern among nato peacekeepers in macedonia that extremists will rekindle hatred among the slavic and albanian macedonians during the upcoming election campaign .

bosnian serbs slaughtered up to 8,000 muslim men and boys and all the dutch peacekeepers could do was look the other way because they did not have a mandate to engage in combat .
to this day , feelings of guilt over srebrenica weigh heavily on the dutch .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .

the international force has successfully prevented civil war between slavic and albanian parts of the macedonian population . in the past decade of balkan crises , the international community often waited too long before it intervened militarily , deciding to do so only after many lives and livelihoods had been lost .
but there 's one balkan region where early nato intervention successfully helped avert war : macedonia .
last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .
its mission is to oversee the peace process .
in addition , the nato force protects international monitors who keep an eye on the return of macedonian refugees to areas that were held by ethnic albanian rebels last year .
a fragile peace the peace in macedonia is still extremely fragile .
it would not hold if nato pulled out any time soon .
research conducted by the u.s. department of state revealed that 87 percent of the people in macedonia have little confidence in the peace accord .
" it 's obvious that the accord has n't satisfied the albanians and that they have more ambitious plans when they think of macedonia , " the regional dnevnik newspaper commented , echoing a common sentiment .
there 's concern among nato peacekeepers in macedonia that extremists will rekindle hatred among the slavic and albanian macedonians during the upcoming election campaign .
macedonians will go to the polls on september 15 – and the campaign is already dominated by nationalist overtones .
after taking over command of " amber fox " this week , dutch general jan harm de jonge said he expects increased tension ahead of the elections .
" it is part of politics , " de jonge said .
macedonia important for the dutch when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became the country 's highest-profile military operation since the bosnian war of the 1990s .
dutch general de jonge is under extreme pressure : if he does well in macedonia , he could help heal the wounds holland suffered in that conflict .
in 1995 , dutch peacekeepers were unable to prevent a massacre in the srebrenica enclave .
bosnian serbs slaughtered up to 8,000 muslim men and boys and all the dutch peacekeepers could do was look the other way because they did not have a mandate to engage in combat .
to this day , feelings of guilt over srebrenica weigh heavily on the dutch .
earlier this year , the dutch government resigned after historians published a damning report about the massacre .
the report condemned politicians and the military for sending the dutch troops to the enclave on what it said was an impossible mission .
when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became its highest-profile military operation since srebrenica .
at the handover ceremony for operation " amber fox " , dutch general de jonge was asked if taking on new responsibility in macedonia was an attempt to rehabilitate the dutch military 's reputation .
but de jonge was reluctant to get deeper into the issue .
" i have nothing to do with that , " the general said .
" i 'm here to perform a mission ... and that 's what i have been trained to do . "
the dutch may be the last nation to command the nato mission in macedonia .
in october , the european union plans to take over from nato .
it would be the first time in history that the eu launches a peacekeeping mission – and a test case for the block 's common approach to foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr to say bye to the balkans the german defence minister announced that the number of german soldiers stationed in the balkans will be reduced this year , just as the parliament extended the german peacekeeping mission in macedonia .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .

when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .

the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .
the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .

the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "

the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .

it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .
" but it 's also correct that the g8 and the rich countries in general do too little for africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.06.2002 a world cup ripple effect ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a world cup victory might just boost schröder 's chances of staying in office .
as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team chief rudi voeller stands beside figures for training during german soccer team training in seogwipo , south korea , on wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .
a german world cup win would favor the incumbent gerhard schröder , who is likely praying hard for a victory these days , since poll numbers just out show his spd party trailing the opposition . dirk vogel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one world around football far from being the polarised victims of disintegrating society , the world cup has showed that we still enjoy each other ’ s company and that the language of football talks sense .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .

but critics say the programs on the table provide too little , too late . it 's about 11 a.m. in calgary .
eight young men in soccer uniforms are wearing enormous masks of the leaders of the g8 countries , who are meeting about one hour away in the mountain outpost of kananaskis for their annual summit .
the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .
the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .
but these men are mainly here to protest current aid proposals being discussed by the g8 for africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " africa is giving the eight heads of state a yellow card , " says jörn kalinski of the international aid organization oxfam germany .
" the purpose of this meeting is to adopt an action plan for africa .
but from everything we 've heard , it 's only going to be peanuts that they decide on here .
it wo n't be nearly enough . "
the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .
africans helping africans help themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this money could also help the five african countries planning to introduce the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- in kananaski .
the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .
schröder pledges support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder offered his support for the nepad initiative in an editorial published on wednesday in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " we need a more intensive partnership with africa , " schröder wrote .
he pledged that germany would bilaterally forgive 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.95 billion -rrb- to african countries and an additional 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- in multiladeral debt as part of its efforts to support the initiative .
additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .
" but it 's also correct that the g8 and the rich countries in general do too little for africa .
now they 're talking about a billion dollars .
take a look at the world bank 's action plan .
in order to ensure that every child in the world has access to a school education by 2015 , they predict it will cost $ 10 to 15 billion annually .
then you can see that a billion is nowhere near enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are drugs firms exploiting aids ?

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .
michael verhaeghe , one of the lawyers for the group of palestinians , said his clients would take the case to belgium ’ s supreme court of appeal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .

under the plan , the u.s. will contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.18 billion euro -rrb- and the other erstwhile g7 nations an additional $ 10 billion over the next ten years .
" this threat is not over yet .
we have to make sure that at every single level , " british prime minister tony blair said at kananaskis , " we carry this fight on , and it will take a long time , " he said .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .
michael verhaeghe , one of the lawyers for the group of palestinians , said his clients would take the case to belgium ’ s supreme court of appeal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .

" this threat is not over yet .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team chief rudi voeller stands beside figures for training during german soccer team training in seogwipo , south korea , on wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .
a german world cup win would favor the incumbent gerhard schröder , who is likely praying hard for a victory these days , since poll numbers just out show his spd party trailing the opposition . dirk vogel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one world around football far from being the polarised victims of disintegrating society , the world cup has showed that we still enjoy each other ’ s company and that the language of football talks sense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.06.2002 leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch - his media empire is crumbling , but he 's still fighting the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire . media mogul leo kirch on wednesday moved to take action against long-standing rival axel springer verlag by seeking an independent investigation into a controversial put option that springer insisted on exercising in a move that kirch blames for causing the collapse of his empire .
kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

but critics say the programs on the table provide too little , too late . it 's about 11 a.m. in calgary .
eight young men in soccer uniforms are wearing enormous masks of the leaders of the g8 countries , who are meeting about one hour away in the mountain outpost of kananaskis for their annual summit .
the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .
the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .
but these men are mainly here to protest current aid proposals being discussed by the g8 for africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " africa is giving the eight heads of state a yellow card , " says jörn kalinski of the international aid organization oxfam germany .
" the purpose of this meeting is to adopt an action plan for africa .
but from everything we 've heard , it 's only going to be peanuts that they decide on here .
it wo n't be nearly enough . "
the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .
africans helping africans help themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this money could also help the five african countries planning to introduce the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- in kananaski .
the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .
schröder pledges support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder offered his support for the nepad initiative in an editorial published on wednesday in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " we need a more intensive partnership with africa , " schröder wrote .
he pledged that germany would bilaterally forgive 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.95 billion -rrb- to african countries and an additional 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- in multiladeral debt as part of its efforts to support the initiative .
additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .
" but it 's also correct that the g8 and the rich countries in general do too little for africa .
now they 're talking about a billion dollars .
take a look at the world bank 's action plan .
in order to ensure that every child in the world has access to a school education by 2015 , they predict it will cost $ 10 to 15 billion annually .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .
money for decommissioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as part of the deal , russia is also to receive $ 20 billion -lrb- 20.29 billion euro -rrb- for the decommissioning of its weapons of mass destruction .
under the plan , the u.s. will contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.18 billion euro -rrb- and the other erstwhile g7 nations an additional $ 10 billion over the next ten years .
" this threat is not over yet .
we have to make sure that at every single level , " british prime minister tony blair said at kananaskis , " we carry this fight on , and it will take a long time , " he said .
tacke of the german finance ministry described the project as a holdover from the cold war era .
" there 's a collective responsibility for all countries to contribute , " he said .
" by increasing security in this area and supporting efforts to destroy hazardous materials , we 're also contributing to our own security , " he said .
extending the olive branch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's membership in the g8 is the latest olive branch offered to the former cold war superpower as an acknowledgement of its efforts to expand democracy and free market systems within its borders and to increase its role in international security cooperation . last month , the north atlantic treaty organization created a new nato-russia council that will transform its former nemesis into a strategic partner in many of its military initiatives .
u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .
but he has succeeded in making the war against terrorism the political octopus of the meeting , with tentacles reaching into virtually every theme on the agenda - from safeguarding and decommissioning russian weapons to eradicating poverty in africa , which the g8 leaders believe fuels political instability and terrorism . on wednesday , the g8 also agreed to cooperate on new airline and air freight security measures in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks , including better sharing of passenger lists , securing cockpit doors , and making it more difficult for terrorists to transport dangerous materials .
on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .
since the start of the program , close to $ 40 billion in debt has been forgiven for the world 's poorest countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and russia bury the cold war hatchet it divided germany and the world , but with the historic signing of an arms reduction treaty in moscow , bush and putin say the countdown to doomsday has been stopped .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .

but critics say the programs on the table provide too little , too late . it 's about 11 a.m. in calgary .
eight young men in soccer uniforms are wearing enormous masks of the leaders of the g8 countries , who are meeting about one hour away in the mountain outpost of kananaskis for their annual summit .
the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .
the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .
but these men are mainly here to protest current aid proposals being discussed by the g8 for africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " africa is giving the eight heads of state a yellow card , " says jörn kalinski of the international aid organization oxfam germany .
" the purpose of this meeting is to adopt an action plan for africa .

it wo n't be nearly enough . "
the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .

the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .
schröder pledges support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder offered his support for the nepad initiative in an editorial published on wednesday in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " we need a more intensive partnership with africa , " schröder wrote .

additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team chief rudi voeller stands beside figures for training during german soccer team training in seogwipo , south korea , on wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .

but critics say the programs on the table provide too little , too late . it 's about 11 a.m. in calgary .
eight young men in soccer uniforms are wearing enormous masks of the leaders of the g8 countries , who are meeting about one hour away in the mountain outpost of kananaskis for their annual summit .
the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .
the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .
but these men are mainly here to protest current aid proposals being discussed by the g8 for africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " africa is giving the eight heads of state a yellow card , " says jörn kalinski of the international aid organization oxfam germany .
" the purpose of this meeting is to adopt an action plan for africa .
but from everything we 've heard , it 's only going to be peanuts that they decide on here .
it wo n't be nearly enough . "
the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .
africans helping africans help themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this money could also help the five african countries planning to introduce the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- in kananaski .
the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .
schröder pledges support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder offered his support for the nepad initiative in an editorial published on wednesday in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " we need a more intensive partnership with africa , " schröder wrote .
he pledged that germany would bilaterally forgive 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.95 billion -rrb- to african countries and an additional 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- in multiladeral debt as part of its efforts to support the initiative .
additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .
" but it 's also correct that the g8 and the rich countries in general do too little for africa .
now they 're talking about a billion dollars .
take a look at the world bank 's action plan .
in order to ensure that every child in the world has access to a school education by 2015 , they predict it will cost $ 10 to 15 billion annually .
then you can see that a billion is nowhere near enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are drugs firms exploiting aids ?
more than 20 million people have died of aids since the epidemic began .
pharmaceutical companies are concerned with their profit margins and do not want to give treatments away at reduced costs , sparking an international debate over ethics .
war on terror likely to dominate g8 summit the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .
michael verhaeghe , one of the lawyers for the group of palestinians , said his clients would take the case to belgium ’ s supreme court of appeal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but critics say the programs on the table provide too little , too late . it 's about 11 a.m. in calgary .
eight young men in soccer uniforms are wearing enormous masks of the leaders of the g8 countries , who are meeting about one hour away in the mountain outpost of kananaskis for their annual summit .
the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .
the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .
but these men are mainly here to protest current aid proposals being discussed by the g8 for africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " africa is giving the eight heads of state a yellow card , " says jörn kalinski of the international aid organization oxfam germany .
" the purpose of this meeting is to adopt an action plan for africa .
but from everything we 've heard , it 's only going to be peanuts that they decide on here .
it wo n't be nearly enough . "
the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .
africans helping africans help themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this money could also help the five african countries planning to introduce the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- in kananaski .
the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .
schröder pledges support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder offered his support for the nepad initiative in an editorial published on wednesday in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " we need a more intensive partnership with africa , " schröder wrote .
he pledged that germany would bilaterally forgive 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.95 billion -rrb- to african countries and an additional 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- in multiladeral debt as part of its efforts to support the initiative .
additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .
" but it 's also correct that the g8 and the rich countries in general do too little for africa .
now they 're talking about a billion dollars .
take a look at the world bank 's action plan .
in order to ensure that every child in the world has access to a school education by 2015 , they predict it will cost $ 10 to 15 billion annually .
then you can see that a billion is nowhere near enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are drugs firms exploiting aids ?

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .
michael verhaeghe , one of the lawyers for the group of palestinians , said his clients would take the case to belgium ’ s supreme court of appeal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team chief rudi voeller stands beside figures for training during german soccer team training in seogwipo , south korea , on wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .
a german world cup win would favor the incumbent gerhard schröder , who is likely praying hard for a victory these days , since poll numbers just out show his spd party trailing the opposition . dirk vogel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one world around football far from being the polarised victims of disintegrating society , the world cup has showed that we still enjoy each other ’ s company and that the language of football talks sense .

last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .
michael verhaeghe , one of the lawyers for the group of palestinians , said his clients would take the case to belgium ’ s supreme court of appeal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.06.2002 a marshall plan for africa - sort of großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing with africa 's future the g8 leaders gathering in canada this week want to unveil a new action plan to reduce poverty , corruption , stop the spread of aids in africa .
but critics say the programs on the table provide too little , too late . it 's about 11 a.m. in calgary .
eight young men in soccer uniforms are wearing enormous masks of the leaders of the g8 countries , who are meeting about one hour away in the mountain outpost of kananaskis for their annual summit .
the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .
the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .
but these men are mainly here to protest current aid proposals being discussed by the g8 for africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " africa is giving the eight heads of state a yellow card , " says jörn kalinski of the international aid organization oxfam germany .
" the purpose of this meeting is to adopt an action plan for africa .
but from everything we 've heard , it 's only going to be peanuts that they decide on here .
it wo n't be nearly enough . "
the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .
africans helping africans help themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this money could also help the five african countries planning to introduce the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- in kananaski .
the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .
schröder pledges support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder offered his support for the nepad initiative in an editorial published on wednesday in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " we need a more intensive partnership with africa , " schröder wrote .
he pledged that germany would bilaterally forgive 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.95 billion -rrb- to african countries and an additional 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- in multiladeral debt as part of its efforts to support the initiative .
additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .
" but it 's also correct that the g8 and the rich countries in general do too little for africa .
now they 're talking about a billion dollars .
take a look at the world bank 's action plan .
in order to ensure that every child in the world has access to a school education by 2015 , they predict it will cost $ 10 to 15 billion annually .
then you can see that a billion is nowhere near enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are drugs firms exploiting aids ?
more than 20 million people have died of aids since the epidemic began .
pharmaceutical companies are concerned with their profit margins and do not want to give treatments away at reduced costs , sparking an international debate over ethics .
war on terror likely to dominate g8 summit the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .
other issues like free trade and a aid for africa could be overshadowed .

but critics say the programs on the table provide too little , too late . it 's about 11 a.m. in calgary .
eight young men in soccer uniforms are wearing enormous masks of the leaders of the g8 countries , who are meeting about one hour away in the mountain outpost of kananaskis for their annual summit .
the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .
the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .
but these men are mainly here to protest current aid proposals being discussed by the g8 for africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " africa is giving the eight heads of state a yellow card , " says jörn kalinski of the international aid organization oxfam germany .
" the purpose of this meeting is to adopt an action plan for africa .
but from everything we 've heard , it 's only going to be peanuts that they decide on here .
it wo n't be nearly enough . "
the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .
africans helping africans help themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this money could also help the five african countries planning to introduce the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- in kananaski .
the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .
schröder pledges support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder offered his support for the nepad initiative in an editorial published on wednesday in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " we need a more intensive partnership with africa , " schröder wrote .
he pledged that germany would bilaterally forgive 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.95 billion -rrb- to african countries and an additional 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- in multiladeral debt as part of its efforts to support the initiative .
additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .
" but it 's also correct that the g8 and the rich countries in general do too little for africa .

but critics say the programs on the table provide too little , too late . it 's about 11 a.m. in calgary .
eight young men in soccer uniforms are wearing enormous masks of the leaders of the g8 countries , who are meeting about one hour away in the mountain outpost of kananaskis for their annual summit .
the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .
the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .
but these men are mainly here to protest current aid proposals being discussed by the g8 for africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " africa is giving the eight heads of state a yellow card , " says jörn kalinski of the international aid organization oxfam germany .
" the purpose of this meeting is to adopt an action plan for africa .
but from everything we 've heard , it 's only going to be peanuts that they decide on here .
it wo n't be nearly enough . "
the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .
africans helping africans help themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this money could also help the five african countries planning to introduce the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- in kananaski .
the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .
schröder pledges support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder offered his support for the nepad initiative in an editorial published on wednesday in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " we need a more intensive partnership with africa , " schröder wrote .
he pledged that germany would bilaterally forgive 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.95 billion -rrb- to african countries and an additional 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- in multiladeral debt as part of its efforts to support the initiative .
additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .
" but it 's also correct that the g8 and the rich countries in general do too little for africa .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .

relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .
michael verhaeghe , one of the lawyers for the group of palestinians , said his clients would take the case to belgium ’ s supreme court of appeal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.06.2002 a world cup ripple effect ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a world cup victory might just boost schröder 's chances of staying in office .
as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team chief rudi voeller stands beside figures for training during german soccer team training in seogwipo , south korea , on wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .
a german world cup win would favor the incumbent gerhard schröder , who is likely praying hard for a victory these days , since poll numbers just out show his spd party trailing the opposition . dirk vogel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one world around football far from being the polarised victims of disintegrating society , the world cup has showed that we still enjoy each other ’ s company and that the language of football talks sense .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .

a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .

the international force has successfully prevented civil war between slavic and albanian parts of the macedonian population . in the past decade of balkan crises , the international community often waited too long before it intervened militarily , deciding to do so only after many lives and livelihoods had been lost .
but there 's one balkan region where early nato intervention successfully helped avert war : macedonia .
last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .
its mission is to oversee the peace process .
in addition , the nato force protects international monitors who keep an eye on the return of macedonian refugees to areas that were held by ethnic albanian rebels last year .
a fragile peace the peace in macedonia is still extremely fragile .
it would not hold if nato pulled out any time soon .
research conducted by the u.s. department of state revealed that 87 percent of the people in macedonia have little confidence in the peace accord .
" it 's obvious that the accord has n't satisfied the albanians and that they have more ambitious plans when they think of macedonia , " the regional dnevnik newspaper commented , echoing a common sentiment .
there 's concern among nato peacekeepers in macedonia that extremists will rekindle hatred among the slavic and albanian macedonians during the upcoming election campaign .
macedonians will go to the polls on september 15 – and the campaign is already dominated by nationalist overtones .
after taking over command of " amber fox " this week , dutch general jan harm de jonge said he expects increased tension ahead of the elections .

dutch general de jonge is under extreme pressure : if he does well in macedonia , he could help heal the wounds holland suffered in that conflict .
in 1995 , dutch peacekeepers were unable to prevent a massacre in the srebrenica enclave .
bosnian serbs slaughtered up to 8,000 muslim men and boys and all the dutch peacekeepers could do was look the other way because they did not have a mandate to engage in combat .
to this day , feelings of guilt over srebrenica weigh heavily on the dutch .
earlier this year , the dutch government resigned after historians published a damning report about the massacre .
the report condemned politicians and the military for sending the dutch troops to the enclave on what it said was an impossible mission .
when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became its highest-profile military operation since srebrenica .
at the handover ceremony for operation " amber fox " , dutch general de jonge was asked if taking on new responsibility in macedonia was an attempt to rehabilitate the dutch military 's reputation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.06.2002 leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch - his media empire is crumbling , but he 's still fighting the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire . media mogul leo kirch on wednesday moved to take action against long-standing rival axel springer verlag by seeking an independent investigation into a controversial put option that springer insisted on exercising in a move that kirch blames for causing the collapse of his empire .
kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .

under the plan , the u.s. will contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.18 billion euro -rrb- and the other erstwhile g7 nations an additional $ 10 billion over the next ten years .
" this threat is not over yet .
we have to make sure that at every single level , " british prime minister tony blair said at kananaskis , " we carry this fight on , and it will take a long time , " he said .
tacke of the german finance ministry described the project as a holdover from the cold war era .
" there 's a collective responsibility for all countries to contribute , " he said .
" by increasing security in this area and supporting efforts to destroy hazardous materials , we 're also contributing to our own security , " he said .

u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .
but he has succeeded in making the war against terrorism the political octopus of the meeting , with tentacles reaching into virtually every theme on the agenda - from safeguarding and decommissioning russian weapons to eradicating poverty in africa , which the g8 leaders believe fuels political instability and terrorism . on wednesday , the g8 also agreed to cooperate on new airline and air freight security measures in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks , including better sharing of passenger lists , securing cockpit doors , and making it more difficult for terrorists to transport dangerous materials .
on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .
money for decommissioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as part of the deal , russia is also to receive $ 20 billion -lrb- 20.29 billion euro -rrb- for the decommissioning of its weapons of mass destruction .
under the plan , the u.s. will contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.18 billion euro -rrb- and the other erstwhile g7 nations an additional $ 10 billion over the next ten years .
" this threat is not over yet .
we have to make sure that at every single level , " british prime minister tony blair said at kananaskis , " we carry this fight on , and it will take a long time , " he said .
tacke of the german finance ministry described the project as a holdover from the cold war era .
" there 's a collective responsibility for all countries to contribute , " he said .
" by increasing security in this area and supporting efforts to destroy hazardous materials , we 're also contributing to our own security , " he said .
extending the olive branch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's membership in the g8 is the latest olive branch offered to the former cold war superpower as an acknowledgement of its efforts to expand democracy and free market systems within its borders and to increase its role in international security cooperation . last month , the north atlantic treaty organization created a new nato-russia council that will transform its former nemesis into a strategic partner in many of its military initiatives .
u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .
but he has succeeded in making the war against terrorism the political octopus of the meeting , with tentacles reaching into virtually every theme on the agenda - from safeguarding and decommissioning russian weapons to eradicating poverty in africa , which the g8 leaders believe fuels political instability and terrorism . on wednesday , the g8 also agreed to cooperate on new airline and air freight security measures in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks , including better sharing of passenger lists , securing cockpit doors , and making it more difficult for terrorists to transport dangerous materials .
on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .

the international force has successfully prevented civil war between slavic and albanian parts of the macedonian population . in the past decade of balkan crises , the international community often waited too long before it intervened militarily , deciding to do so only after many lives and livelihoods had been lost .
but there 's one balkan region where early nato intervention successfully helped avert war : macedonia .
last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .
its mission is to oversee the peace process .
in addition , the nato force protects international monitors who keep an eye on the return of macedonian refugees to areas that were held by ethnic albanian rebels last year .
a fragile peace the peace in macedonia is still extremely fragile .
it would not hold if nato pulled out any time soon .
research conducted by the u.s. department of state revealed that 87 percent of the people in macedonia have little confidence in the peace accord .
" it 's obvious that the accord has n't satisfied the albanians and that they have more ambitious plans when they think of macedonia , " the regional dnevnik newspaper commented , echoing a common sentiment .
there 's concern among nato peacekeepers in macedonia that extremists will rekindle hatred among the slavic and albanian macedonians during the upcoming election campaign .
macedonians will go to the polls on september 15 – and the campaign is already dominated by nationalist overtones .
after taking over command of " amber fox " this week , dutch general jan harm de jonge said he expects increased tension ahead of the elections .
" it is part of politics , " de jonge said .
macedonia important for the dutch when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became the country 's highest-profile military operation since the bosnian war of the 1990s .
dutch general de jonge is under extreme pressure : if he does well in macedonia , he could help heal the wounds holland suffered in that conflict .
in 1995 , dutch peacekeepers were unable to prevent a massacre in the srebrenica enclave .
bosnian serbs slaughtered up to 8,000 muslim men and boys and all the dutch peacekeepers could do was look the other way because they did not have a mandate to engage in combat .
to this day , feelings of guilt over srebrenica weigh heavily on the dutch .
earlier this year , the dutch government resigned after historians published a damning report about the massacre .
the report condemned politicians and the military for sending the dutch troops to the enclave on what it said was an impossible mission .
when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became its highest-profile military operation since srebrenica .
at the handover ceremony for operation " amber fox " , dutch general de jonge was asked if taking on new responsibility in macedonia was an attempt to rehabilitate the dutch military 's reputation .
but de jonge was reluctant to get deeper into the issue .
" i have nothing to do with that , " the general said .
" i 'm here to perform a mission ... and that 's what i have been trained to do . "
the dutch may be the last nation to command the nato mission in macedonia .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .

on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team chief rudi voeller stands beside figures for training during german soccer team training in seogwipo , south korea , on wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .
a german world cup win would favor the incumbent gerhard schröder , who is likely praying hard for a victory these days , since poll numbers just out show his spd party trailing the opposition . dirk vogel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one world around football far from being the polarised victims of disintegrating society , the world cup has showed that we still enjoy each other ’ s company and that the language of football talks sense .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .
money for decommissioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as part of the deal , russia is also to receive $ 20 billion -lrb- 20.29 billion euro -rrb- for the decommissioning of its weapons of mass destruction .
under the plan , the u.s. will contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.18 billion euro -rrb- and the other erstwhile g7 nations an additional $ 10 billion over the next ten years .
" this threat is not over yet .
we have to make sure that at every single level , " british prime minister tony blair said at kananaskis , " we carry this fight on , and it will take a long time , " he said .
tacke of the german finance ministry described the project as a holdover from the cold war era .
" there 's a collective responsibility for all countries to contribute , " he said .
" by increasing security in this area and supporting efforts to destroy hazardous materials , we 're also contributing to our own security , " he said .
extending the olive branch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's membership in the g8 is the latest olive branch offered to the former cold war superpower as an acknowledgement of its efforts to expand democracy and free market systems within its borders and to increase its role in international security cooperation . last month , the north atlantic treaty organization created a new nato-russia council that will transform its former nemesis into a strategic partner in many of its military initiatives .
u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .
but he has succeeded in making the war against terrorism the political octopus of the meeting , with tentacles reaching into virtually every theme on the agenda - from safeguarding and decommissioning russian weapons to eradicating poverty in africa , which the g8 leaders believe fuels political instability and terrorism . on wednesday , the g8 also agreed to cooperate on new airline and air freight security measures in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks , including better sharing of passenger lists , securing cockpit doors , and making it more difficult for terrorists to transport dangerous materials .
on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .
since the start of the program , close to $ 40 billion in debt has been forgiven for the world 's poorest countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and russia bury the cold war hatchet it divided germany and the world , but with the historic signing of an arms reduction treaty in moscow , bush and putin say the countdown to doomsday has been stopped .

the international force has successfully prevented civil war between slavic and albanian parts of the macedonian population . in the past decade of balkan crises , the international community often waited too long before it intervened militarily , deciding to do so only after many lives and livelihoods had been lost .
but there 's one balkan region where early nato intervention successfully helped avert war : macedonia .
last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .
its mission is to oversee the peace process .
in addition , the nato force protects international monitors who keep an eye on the return of macedonian refugees to areas that were held by ethnic albanian rebels last year .
a fragile peace the peace in macedonia is still extremely fragile .
it would not hold if nato pulled out any time soon .
research conducted by the u.s. department of state revealed that 87 percent of the people in macedonia have little confidence in the peace accord .
" it 's obvious that the accord has n't satisfied the albanians and that they have more ambitious plans when they think of macedonia , " the regional dnevnik newspaper commented , echoing a common sentiment .
there 's concern among nato peacekeepers in macedonia that extremists will rekindle hatred among the slavic and albanian macedonians during the upcoming election campaign .
macedonians will go to the polls on september 15 – and the campaign is already dominated by nationalist overtones .
after taking over command of " amber fox " this week , dutch general jan harm de jonge said he expects increased tension ahead of the elections .
" it is part of politics , " de jonge said .
macedonia important for the dutch when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became the country 's highest-profile military operation since the bosnian war of the 1990s .
dutch general de jonge is under extreme pressure : if he does well in macedonia , he could help heal the wounds holland suffered in that conflict .
in 1995 , dutch peacekeepers were unable to prevent a massacre in the srebrenica enclave .
bosnian serbs slaughtered up to 8,000 muslim men and boys and all the dutch peacekeepers could do was look the other way because they did not have a mandate to engage in combat .
to this day , feelings of guilt over srebrenica weigh heavily on the dutch .
earlier this year , the dutch government resigned after historians published a damning report about the massacre .
the report condemned politicians and the military for sending the dutch troops to the enclave on what it said was an impossible mission .
when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became its highest-profile military operation since srebrenica .
at the handover ceremony for operation " amber fox " , dutch general de jonge was asked if taking on new responsibility in macedonia was an attempt to rehabilitate the dutch military 's reputation .
but de jonge was reluctant to get deeper into the issue .
" i have nothing to do with that , " the general said .
" i 'm here to perform a mission ... and that 's what i have been trained to do . "

the men kick the soccer ball back and forth to one another , always keeping the ball to themselves .
an african referee blows his whistle and pulls out a yellow card for each teammate , saying they 're playing an unfair game .

according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .

60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "

the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .

according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .
africans helping africans help themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this money could also help the five african countries planning to introduce the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- in kananaski .
the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .
schröder pledges support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder offered his support for the nepad initiative in an editorial published on wednesday in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " we need a more intensive partnership with africa , " schröder wrote .
he pledged that germany would bilaterally forgive 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.95 billion -rrb- to african countries and an additional 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- in multiladeral debt as part of its efforts to support the initiative .
additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .
" but it 's also correct that the g8 and the rich countries in general do too little for africa .
now they 're talking about a billion dollars .
take a look at the world bank 's action plan .
in order to ensure that every child in the world has access to a school education by 2015 , they predict it will cost $ 10 to 15 billion annually .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .

the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .

" this threat is not over yet .
we have to make sure that at every single level , " british prime minister tony blair said at kananaskis , " we carry this fight on , and it will take a long time , " he said .
tacke of the german finance ministry described the project as a holdover from the cold war era .

" by increasing security in this area and supporting efforts to destroy hazardous materials , we 're also contributing to our own security , " he said .

u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .
but he has succeeded in making the war against terrorism the political octopus of the meeting , with tentacles reaching into virtually every theme on the agenda - from safeguarding and decommissioning russian weapons to eradicating poverty in africa , which the g8 leaders believe fuels political instability and terrorism . on wednesday , the g8 also agreed to cooperate on new airline and air freight security measures in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks , including better sharing of passenger lists , securing cockpit doors , and making it more difficult for terrorists to transport dangerous materials .
on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

the international force has successfully prevented civil war between slavic and albanian parts of the macedonian population . in the past decade of balkan crises , the international community often waited too long before it intervened militarily , deciding to do so only after many lives and livelihoods had been lost .
but there 's one balkan region where early nato intervention successfully helped avert war : macedonia .
last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .
its mission is to oversee the peace process .
in addition , the nato force protects international monitors who keep an eye on the return of macedonian refugees to areas that were held by ethnic albanian rebels last year .
a fragile peace the peace in macedonia is still extremely fragile .
it would not hold if nato pulled out any time soon .
research conducted by the u.s. department of state revealed that 87 percent of the people in macedonia have little confidence in the peace accord .
" it 's obvious that the accord has n't satisfied the albanians and that they have more ambitious plans when they think of macedonia , " the regional dnevnik newspaper commented , echoing a common sentiment .
there 's concern among nato peacekeepers in macedonia that extremists will rekindle hatred among the slavic and albanian macedonians during the upcoming election campaign .
macedonians will go to the polls on september 15 – and the campaign is already dominated by nationalist overtones .
after taking over command of " amber fox " this week , dutch general jan harm de jonge said he expects increased tension ahead of the elections .
" it is part of politics , " de jonge said .
macedonia important for the dutch when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became the country 's highest-profile military operation since the bosnian war of the 1990s .
dutch general de jonge is under extreme pressure : if he does well in macedonia , he could help heal the wounds holland suffered in that conflict .
in 1995 , dutch peacekeepers were unable to prevent a massacre in the srebrenica enclave .
bosnian serbs slaughtered up to 8,000 muslim men and boys and all the dutch peacekeepers could do was look the other way because they did not have a mandate to engage in combat .
to this day , feelings of guilt over srebrenica weigh heavily on the dutch .
earlier this year , the dutch government resigned after historians published a damning report about the massacre .
the report condemned politicians and the military for sending the dutch troops to the enclave on what it said was an impossible mission .
when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became its highest-profile military operation since srebrenica .
at the handover ceremony for operation " amber fox " , dutch general de jonge was asked if taking on new responsibility in macedonia was an attempt to rehabilitate the dutch military 's reputation .
but de jonge was reluctant to get deeper into the issue .
" i have nothing to do with that , " the general said .
" i 'm here to perform a mission ... and that 's what i have been trained to do . "
the dutch may be the last nation to command the nato mission in macedonia .
in october , the european union plans to take over from nato .

since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team chief rudi voeller stands beside figures for training during german soccer team training in seogwipo , south korea , on wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .
a german world cup win would favor the incumbent gerhard schröder , who is likely praying hard for a victory these days , since poll numbers just out show his spd party trailing the opposition . dirk vogel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one world around football far from being the polarised victims of disintegrating society , the world cup has showed that we still enjoy each other ’ s company and that the language of football talks sense .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.06.2002 the " amber fox " now speaks dutch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the past nine months , germany was in charge of nato 's macedonia force the netherlands has taken over command of nato 's " amber fox " peacekeeping force in macedonia .
the international force has successfully prevented civil war between slavic and albanian parts of the macedonian population . in the past decade of balkan crises , the international community often waited too long before it intervened militarily , deciding to do so only after many lives and livelihoods had been lost .
but there 's one balkan region where early nato intervention successfully helped avert war : macedonia .
last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .
its mission is to oversee the peace process .
in addition , the nato force protects international monitors who keep an eye on the return of macedonian refugees to areas that were held by ethnic albanian rebels last year .
a fragile peace the peace in macedonia is still extremely fragile .
it would not hold if nato pulled out any time soon .
research conducted by the u.s. department of state revealed that 87 percent of the people in macedonia have little confidence in the peace accord .
" it 's obvious that the accord has n't satisfied the albanians and that they have more ambitious plans when they think of macedonia , " the regional dnevnik newspaper commented , echoing a common sentiment .
there 's concern among nato peacekeepers in macedonia that extremists will rekindle hatred among the slavic and albanian macedonians during the upcoming election campaign .
macedonians will go to the polls on september 15 – and the campaign is already dominated by nationalist overtones .
after taking over command of " amber fox " this week , dutch general jan harm de jonge said he expects increased tension ahead of the elections .
" it is part of politics , " de jonge said .
macedonia important for the dutch when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became the country 's highest-profile military operation since the bosnian war of the 1990s .
dutch general de jonge is under extreme pressure : if he does well in macedonia , he could help heal the wounds holland suffered in that conflict .
in 1995 , dutch peacekeepers were unable to prevent a massacre in the srebrenica enclave .
bosnian serbs slaughtered up to 8,000 muslim men and boys and all the dutch peacekeepers could do was look the other way because they did not have a mandate to engage in combat .
to this day , feelings of guilt over srebrenica weigh heavily on the dutch .
earlier this year , the dutch government resigned after historians published a damning report about the massacre .
the report condemned politicians and the military for sending the dutch troops to the enclave on what it said was an impossible mission .
when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became its highest-profile military operation since srebrenica .
at the handover ceremony for operation " amber fox " , dutch general de jonge was asked if taking on new responsibility in macedonia was an attempt to rehabilitate the dutch military 's reputation .
but de jonge was reluctant to get deeper into the issue .
" i have nothing to do with that , " the general said .
" i 'm here to perform a mission ... and that 's what i have been trained to do . "
the dutch may be the last nation to command the nato mission in macedonia .
in october , the european union plans to take over from nato .
it would be the first time in history that the eu launches a peacekeeping mission – and a test case for the block 's common approach to foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr to say bye to the balkans the german defence minister announced that the number of german soldiers stationed in the balkans will be reduced this year , just as the parliament extended the german peacekeeping mission in macedonia .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .

the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .
a german world cup win would favor the incumbent gerhard schröder , who is likely praying hard for a victory these days , since poll numbers just out show his spd party trailing the opposition . dirk vogel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one world around football far from being the polarised victims of disintegrating society , the world cup has showed that we still enjoy each other ’ s company and that the language of football talks sense .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .
money for decommissioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as part of the deal , russia is also to receive $ 20 billion -lrb- 20.29 billion euro -rrb- for the decommissioning of its weapons of mass destruction .
under the plan , the u.s. will contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.18 billion euro -rrb- and the other erstwhile g7 nations an additional $ 10 billion over the next ten years .
" this threat is not over yet .
we have to make sure that at every single level , " british prime minister tony blair said at kananaskis , " we carry this fight on , and it will take a long time , " he said .
tacke of the german finance ministry described the project as a holdover from the cold war era .
" there 's a collective responsibility for all countries to contribute , " he said .
" by increasing security in this area and supporting efforts to destroy hazardous materials , we 're also contributing to our own security , " he said .
extending the olive branch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's membership in the g8 is the latest olive branch offered to the former cold war superpower as an acknowledgement of its efforts to expand democracy and free market systems within its borders and to increase its role in international security cooperation . last month , the north atlantic treaty organization created a new nato-russia council that will transform its former nemesis into a strategic partner in many of its military initiatives .
u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .
but he has succeeded in making the war against terrorism the political octopus of the meeting , with tentacles reaching into virtually every theme on the agenda - from safeguarding and decommissioning russian weapons to eradicating poverty in africa , which the g8 leaders believe fuels political instability and terrorism . on wednesday , the g8 also agreed to cooperate on new airline and air freight security measures in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks , including better sharing of passenger lists , securing cockpit doors , and making it more difficult for terrorists to transport dangerous materials .
on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team chief rudi voeller stands beside figures for training during german soccer team training in seogwipo , south korea , on wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .
money for decommissioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as part of the deal , russia is also to receive $ 20 billion -lrb- 20.29 billion euro -rrb- for the decommissioning of its weapons of mass destruction .
under the plan , the u.s. will contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.18 billion euro -rrb- and the other erstwhile g7 nations an additional $ 10 billion over the next ten years .
" this threat is not over yet .
we have to make sure that at every single level , " british prime minister tony blair said at kananaskis , " we carry this fight on , and it will take a long time , " he said .
tacke of the german finance ministry described the project as a holdover from the cold war era .
" there 's a collective responsibility for all countries to contribute , " he said .
" by increasing security in this area and supporting efforts to destroy hazardous materials , we 're also contributing to our own security , " he said .

u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .
but he has succeeded in making the war against terrorism the political octopus of the meeting , with tentacles reaching into virtually every theme on the agenda - from safeguarding and decommissioning russian weapons to eradicating poverty in africa , which the g8 leaders believe fuels political instability and terrorism . on wednesday , the g8 also agreed to cooperate on new airline and air freight security measures in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks , including better sharing of passenger lists , securing cockpit doors , and making it more difficult for terrorists to transport dangerous materials .
on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .

the international force has successfully prevented civil war between slavic and albanian parts of the macedonian population . in the past decade of balkan crises , the international community often waited too long before it intervened militarily , deciding to do so only after many lives and livelihoods had been lost .
but there 's one balkan region where early nato intervention successfully helped avert war : macedonia .
last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .
its mission is to oversee the peace process .
in addition , the nato force protects international monitors who keep an eye on the return of macedonian refugees to areas that were held by ethnic albanian rebels last year .
a fragile peace the peace in macedonia is still extremely fragile .
it would not hold if nato pulled out any time soon .
research conducted by the u.s. department of state revealed that 87 percent of the people in macedonia have little confidence in the peace accord .
" it 's obvious that the accord has n't satisfied the albanians and that they have more ambitious plans when they think of macedonia , " the regional dnevnik newspaper commented , echoing a common sentiment .
there 's concern among nato peacekeepers in macedonia that extremists will rekindle hatred among the slavic and albanian macedonians during the upcoming election campaign .
macedonians will go to the polls on september 15 – and the campaign is already dominated by nationalist overtones .
after taking over command of " amber fox " this week , dutch general jan harm de jonge said he expects increased tension ahead of the elections .
" it is part of politics , " de jonge said .
macedonia important for the dutch when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became the country 's highest-profile military operation since the bosnian war of the 1990s .
dutch general de jonge is under extreme pressure : if he does well in macedonia , he could help heal the wounds holland suffered in that conflict .
in 1995 , dutch peacekeepers were unable to prevent a massacre in the srebrenica enclave .
bosnian serbs slaughtered up to 8,000 muslim men and boys and all the dutch peacekeepers could do was look the other way because they did not have a mandate to engage in combat .
to this day , feelings of guilt over srebrenica weigh heavily on the dutch .
earlier this year , the dutch government resigned after historians published a damning report about the massacre .
the report condemned politicians and the military for sending the dutch troops to the enclave on what it said was an impossible mission .
when the netherlands took charge of nato 's peacekeeping force in macedonia this week , the new command became its highest-profile military operation since srebrenica .
at the handover ceremony for operation " amber fox " , dutch general de jonge was asked if taking on new responsibility in macedonia was an attempt to rehabilitate the dutch military 's reputation .
but de jonge was reluctant to get deeper into the issue .
" i have nothing to do with that , " the general said .
" i 'm here to perform a mission ... and that 's what i have been trained to do . "
the dutch may be the last nation to command the nato mission in macedonia .
in october , the european union plans to take over from nato .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .
money for decommissioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as part of the deal , russia is also to receive $ 20 billion -lrb- 20.29 billion euro -rrb- for the decommissioning of its weapons of mass destruction .
under the plan , the u.s. will contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.18 billion euro -rrb- and the other erstwhile g7 nations an additional $ 10 billion over the next ten years .
" this threat is not over yet .
we have to make sure that at every single level , " british prime minister tony blair said at kananaskis , " we carry this fight on , and it will take a long time , " he said .
tacke of the german finance ministry described the project as a holdover from the cold war era .
" there 's a collective responsibility for all countries to contribute , " he said .
" by increasing security in this area and supporting efforts to destroy hazardous materials , we 're also contributing to our own security , " he said .
extending the olive branch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's membership in the g8 is the latest olive branch offered to the former cold war superpower as an acknowledgement of its efforts to expand democracy and free market systems within its borders and to increase its role in international security cooperation . last month , the north atlantic treaty organization created a new nato-russia council that will transform its former nemesis into a strategic partner in many of its military initiatives .
u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .
but he has succeeded in making the war against terrorism the political octopus of the meeting , with tentacles reaching into virtually every theme on the agenda - from safeguarding and decommissioning russian weapons to eradicating poverty in africa , which the g8 leaders believe fuels political instability and terrorism . on wednesday , the g8 also agreed to cooperate on new airline and air freight security measures in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks , including better sharing of passenger lists , securing cockpit doors , and making it more difficult for terrorists to transport dangerous materials .
on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .
since the start of the program , close to $ 40 billion in debt has been forgiven for the world 's poorest countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and russia bury the cold war hatchet it divided germany and the world , but with the historic signing of an arms reduction treaty in moscow , bush and putin say the countdown to doomsday has been stopped .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team chief rudi voeller stands beside figures for training during german soccer team training in seogwipo , south korea , on wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the german national soccer team won their last group e , 2002 world cup soccer match against cameroon in shizuoka 2-0 on tuesday , june 11 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .
zeh and hagen concluded that non-political issues like sports can have a decisive impact on voters ‘ decisions .
" we found that something like the ‚ general mood ‘ actually exists and that top-events like a soccer world championship have an influence on it , " hagen told dw-world .
hagen and his colleague observed what they call a " halo-effect , " where pleasant events from one walk of life " radiate " their emotional energy into others , even if they be as seemingly far apart as soccer and politics .

the demonstration has been organized by oxfam , the global aid organization .
indeed , organizations like oxfam and even the 2,500 journalists gathered in the canadian province of alberta wo n't have any access to the g8 meeting .
following the violence and fears of a terrorist attack that clouded the last summit in genoa , italy , canadian officials are keeping demonstrators at a safe distance .

the g8 gets serious about africa at the close of the last g8 summit in genoa , the leaders of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia agreed to develop an action plan to reduce poverty in africa , which has been plagued by war , famine , extreme poverty and ravaged by aids in recent years .
according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "
the latter would include , for example , countries that have begun the process of democratization and those that have cracked down on corruption and other political maladies .

the leaders of south africa , algeria , nigeria , senegal and egypt are traveling with un general secretary kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce the plan .
the premise behind nepad is that african countries need to take their own initiative for advancement in order to not be seen by the rest of the world as a " hardship case . "
a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .
in return , the african leaders are asking for more investment from the west and better access to western markets for their products and services .
the core goal of the $ 64 billion -lrb- 64.6 billion euro -rrb- annual project is to cut poverty in half and double the number of telephones in africa by 2015 .

additionally , he reiterated the european union 's plan to increase by $ 7 billion -lrb- 7.067 billion euro -rrb- annual aid to the poorest countries by 2006 .
it currently spends $ 25.4 billion -lrb- 25.64 billion euro -rrb- .
" it 's nowhere near enough " some are less than optimistic about the prospects for nepad in the long run .
kalinski of oxfam germany says he is doubtful that nepad will be strong enough to bring about the revolutionary change needed to help africa to pull itself up by the bootstraps .
" first of all , i think it 's good that african leaders are saying that they need to take responsibilities for themselves , " he says .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .

when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .

on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .

as the german soccer team dribbles its way to the world cup finals , some say bringing home the cup would do more than make fans happy , it could have a positive effect on the country ‘ s economy and politics . if german captain oliver kahn and his teammates do raise the 18-carat gold cup above their heads this sunday , overall effects could go beyond merely filling the streets with flag-waving crowds .
financial experts believe that winning the title may provide a boost for germany ’ s stalled economy , currently suffering in part from weak consumer spending .
some political strategists also expect a victory to heighten confidence in the current government .
" the result would be a positive boost in public opinion and consumer behavior , " dieter hundt , president of the german employers association , told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
important models why is the national team so important ?
hundt says the nation 's all-star line-up provides important identification figures .
this is especially significant at times when most national league teams recruit most of their players from abroad .
hundt points to the 1950s , when most of the team-members of first-league vfb stuttgart actually came from the city 's vicinity .
today , that ’ s no longer the case .
since national teams that participate in the world cup rely solely on native players , they could set a positive example for german industry in encouraging them to invest more in drafting new talent at home , says hundt .
according to recently released figures , german industry is hiring more and more of its top-managers from foreign countries .
will history repeat itself ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend fritz walter pictured in berne , switzerland june 23 , 1995 .
walter was the teamcaptain of the german national soccer team winning the worldchampionship in 1954 .
walter died at the age of 81 monday june 17 , 2002 in his house in enkenbach-alsenborn near kaiserslautern , germany .
-lrb- ap photo / michel euler -rrb- hundt , once a goalkeeper for a swiss major league team , says he bases his opinions on historical precedents , since a world cup victory has proven a potent stimulant to the german economy before .
when german soccer-legend fritz walter and his team took home the world cup in 1954 -lrb- photo -rrb- , a wave of enthusiasm took hold of a nation still struggling to rebuild from the ruins of world war ii .
winning the world cup in 2002 could raise self-esteem and motivate germans to excel in areas other than soccer , hundt said .
such motivation is sorely needed , he said , especially in the fields of education and economy .
other nations are also rooting for the german team as well .
dutch financial experts say a german win would cheer up the country ’ s shoppers , who have been staying away from stores in droves .
a rejuvenated german economy would help europe as a whole , they say .
they add that a victory would increase sales of german products worldwide .
" if the germans win the cup with their simple and efficient game , foreign interest in german products would also rise , " said an official with abm / amro , a dutch bank .
never change a winning team a german triumph could also make itself felt in politics and with national elections just around the corner , political analysts are keeping a close eye on events on the soccer-field .

-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- since it 's not usual for national teams to fire their coaches after losing the tournament , a german victory could not only save coach rudi völler 's -lrb- photo -rrb- job , but could keep ruling chancellor gerhard schroeder from being benched after september ’ s parliamentary elections .
" we are in fact thinking in that direction , " a speaker for the spd-party said .
" but that ’ s more based more on dinner table psychology than actual findings . "
still , the general mood in society would improve , the source said , since voters would feel more content with the current situation .
scientific support dinner table talk or not , there are again precedents to this line of thinking .
a study conducted during the 1998 parliamentary election , when the german team was sent home in the quarter-finals and weeks later chancellor helmut kohl was replaced by challenger gerhard schroeder , found a connection between the world cup and voter behavior .
the study , led by german media analysts reimar zeh and lutz hagen , evaluated the effects of television news on popular attitudes towards candidates .

u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .

according to german government sources , it is likely that the world 's leading industrial nations meeting in canada will agree to an additional injection of financial aid for the poorest countries in africa this week .
two key proposals are being considered : the first is the g8 's own plan , developed by germany and britain , to provide an addition $ 1 billion -lrb- 1.009 billion euro -rrb- toward debt forgiveness and development projects .
60 percent of the supplementary billion , german government sources say , will be allocated for debt relief , with another 40 percent being given as a reward to the countries that have shown the most initiative toward establishing " good governance . "

a good deal of this would be achieved by building an infrastructure that would be desirable for foreign investors .
nepad also calls on member states to eliminate nepotism and ramp up efforts in the international war against terrorism - two areas that make industrial nations skeptical of investment there .

the leaders of the world 's major industrialized countries named russia as a full member of the g8 on wednesday .
the change becomes official in 2006 , when russia will host the group 's summit for the first time . before wednesday 's surprise move , russian president vladimir putin had only been allowed to participate in political discussions at the g8 's annual summit meetings , which bring together the world 's seven richest countries - from the united states to japan - and russia .
but now , putin will be given an equal voice in the body 's economic decision-making as well .
" russia will become a full member of the g8 in 2006 , " alfred tacke , undersecretary in the german ministry of economics , told deutsche welle .
" the french president and the german chancellor pushed hard for the deal . "
as part of the new development , germany will postpone by one year its planned hosting of the summit and its role as rotating g8 chair .
money for decommissioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as part of the deal , russia is also to receive $ 20 billion -lrb- 20.29 billion euro -rrb- for the decommissioning of its weapons of mass destruction .
under the plan , the u.s. will contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.18 billion euro -rrb- and the other erstwhile g7 nations an additional $ 10 billion over the next ten years .
" this threat is not over yet .
we have to make sure that at every single level , " british prime minister tony blair said at kananaskis , " we carry this fight on , and it will take a long time , " he said .
tacke of the german finance ministry described the project as a holdover from the cold war era .
" there 's a collective responsibility for all countries to contribute , " he said .
" by increasing security in this area and supporting efforts to destroy hazardous materials , we 're also contributing to our own security , " he said .
extending the olive branch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's membership in the g8 is the latest olive branch offered to the former cold war superpower as an acknowledgement of its efforts to expand democracy and free market systems within its borders and to increase its role in international security cooperation . last month , the north atlantic treaty organization created a new nato-russia council that will transform its former nemesis into a strategic partner in many of its military initiatives .
u.s. president george w. bush failed in his effort to make the middle east the agenda-driving issue at the canadian summit .
but he has succeeded in making the war against terrorism the political octopus of the meeting , with tentacles reaching into virtually every theme on the agenda - from safeguarding and decommissioning russian weapons to eradicating poverty in africa , which the g8 leaders believe fuels political instability and terrorism . on wednesday , the g8 also agreed to cooperate on new airline and air freight security measures in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks , including better sharing of passenger lists , securing cockpit doors , and making it more difficult for terrorists to transport dangerous materials .
on thursday , the g8 is expected to agree on a $ 1 billion debt-relief package for africa as part of an initiative established in cologne , germany in 1999 .
since the start of the program , close to $ 40 billion in debt has been forgiven for the world 's poorest countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and russia bury the cold war hatchet it divided germany and the world , but with the historic signing of an arms reduction treaty in moscow , bush and putin say the countdown to doomsday has been stopped .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .

but there 's one balkan region where early nato intervention successfully helped avert war : macedonia .
last august , an international nato force managed to end an insurgency of ethnic albanian rebel forces in the former yugoslav republic .
the conflict ended with a western-brokered peace accord granting the large ethnic albanian minority greater civil rights .
in return , nato monitored rebel disarmament .
since then , some 700 soldiers from eleven countries have been working on " operation amber fox " .

a group of palestinians and lebanese had charged sharon with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . ariel sharon will not be facing charges in a brussels courtroom under a controversial belgian law that allows the country ’ s courts the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are committed .
last year in belgium , a complaint was brought against the israeli prime minister by a group of palestinians and lebanese charging him with crimes allegedly committed in 1982 while he was israel 's defense minister .
then , an israeli-backed lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at two refugee camps in beirut , which was occupied by israel at the time .
the following year an israeli commission found him indirectly responsible for the massacre .
but on wednesday , a belgian court dismissed the lawsuit , saying it " is not admissible because of the principle of belgian law that crimes committed in other countries can not be prosecuted in belgium unless the author or presumed author has been found in belgium , " according to a court spokesman .
the rejection deals a major blow to belgium ’ s controversial law , one that was used successfully last year in the prosecution of four rwandans , two nuns and two men , for parts in their country ’ s 1994 genocide .
relief and anger there was jubiliation among sharon ’ s backers when the 22-page ruling was handed out in brussels ’ palais de justice on wednesday .
" it ’ s a lawsuit that started with more politics than law and it is lucky that the outcome is more law then politics , " daniel shek , director of european affairs at the israeli foreign ministry , told reporters at the court .
in israel , prime minister sharon said belgium should not have even considered the complaint .
" one nation can not judge another nation , " he told reporters .
" a nation that doesn ’ t , fortunately , have to fight terror and war will hardly understand a nation that has to do it . "
in lebanon , palestinian refugees saw the ruling as a sign that europe had adopted the position of the united states in backing israel against the palestinians .
" there were already steps to head off court proceedings , but they let them go on to display a sort of fraudulent democracy , " said hussein al-jamal , a resident of the rashideyeh camp in south lebanon .
human rights groups also spoke out against the court ’ s decision .
amnesty international called the ruling a " catastrophe scenario " .
michael verhaeghe , one of the lawyers for the group of palestinians , said his clients would take the case to belgium ’ s supreme court of appeal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

kirch , who holds a 40 % stake in springer , also asked shareholders at springer ’ s annual general meeting on wednesday to support a claim for damages against springer ’ s management board and its main shareholder , friede springer .
the move is the latest episode in a rivalry that goes back to the 1980s when friede springer fought a long battle with leo kirch for control of the springer group , created by her late husband axel .
kirch , whose empire is now almost completely insolvent , wants an investigation of a 767 million euro put option on shares in broadcaster prosiebensat.1 media – part of kirch media – that springer exercised against kirch in january .
the move is widely regarded as having triggered the eventual collapse of the kirch empire .
leo kirch believes that the action was taken to force him to sell his stake in springer and rid friede springer of an uncomfortable minority shareholder .
" the board acted in the interests of the main shareholder , friede springer , but not in the interests of the company and other shareholders , " kirch lawyer ronald frohne told the annual general shareholders ' meeting .
frohne presented shareholders with a motion to force springer to sue its own board and its main shareholder friede springer for damages incurred when it invoked a little-used clause in share law and went ahead and exercised the put option instead of accepting alternative proposals .
he said the board had rejected an offer by kirch to swap the put option for a bigger stake in prosieben , which would have given it a 100 million euro book profit instead of a 767 million euro claim rendered almost worthless after kirch 's insolvency .
springer ’ s chief executive , mathias döpfner , rejected the argument that it had deliberately driven kirch into the ground .
" axel springer verlag had no interest in weakening kirch group , " he said .
" after lengthy negotiations failed to find an alternative solution , we had to exercise the put option . "
leo kirch is the second largest shareholder in springer , behind founder axel springer 's heirs , who hold just over 50 % .
leo kirch is currently trying to sell his springer shares to repay a 720 million euro loan to deutsche bank secured by the stake .
springer has teamed up with privately held heinrich bauer publishing group to consider a bid for the assets of kirch 's media rights group kirchmedia , the unit that controls prosieben .
döpfner said a decision on a bid would be taken in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 26.06.02 © economy .

by nick higham bbc media correspondent they could be doctors or lab technicians in their white coveralls and face masks , surrounded by hi-tech lab equipment .
in fact they are soldiers , members of one of the newest units in the british armed forces .
their job , using specially-designed and equipped vehicles , is to detect chemical or biological weapons used by an enemy on the battlefield .
the joint nbc regiment draws three-quarters of its members from the first royal tank regiment , a quarter from the raf regiment .
like all britain 's servicemen and women , those in the jnbc have been steeped in the traditions of their parent units .
they have sworn an oath of allegiance to the queen , whose portrait hangs on their mess walls .
she is both regiments ' colonel-in-chief .
but the technology they use would be unrecognisable to an earlier generation of soldiers .
so - do they still share the same values as their predecessors ?
in particular , do they still serve - and are they still prepared to die - in the old phrase " for queen and country " ?
lance corporal stephen loughlin from 1 rtr - known as locky - has no doubt .
he is motivated firstly by a sense of comradeship , but secondly by the notion of serving both queen and country .
the queen is , in his words , " the be all and end all " .
locky may not be typical : he originally served in the queen 's regiment but left when it was amalgamated with another regiment and he could not come to terms with the loss of its unique traditions .
he became a security guard , then a dustman , before rejoining the regular army via the ta .
contradictory views however corporal steven higgs from the raf regiment says something very similar .
the queen is a soldier 's ultimate commander : she is special , she needs looking up to and he is proud to have her as his boss .
but staff sergeant pete brooks is more sceptical .
he thinks " queen and country " a rather old-fashioned phrase .
in his view soldiers are motivated more by loyalty to those around them , by a fear of letting down their mates , than by the rather abstract notion of loyalty to the crown .
although , he does concede that in the " royal " tank regiment and elsewhere in the army reminders of the monarchy , even if it 's just the crown as a badge of rank , are rarely far away .
no-one seems too sure about whether it is possible to be a republican and a serving soldier , but at the very least it must involve an ability to hold two quite contradictory sets of views .
the officers , for the most part university-educated , seem less likely to include loyalty to the queen among the things that motivate them .
josh king , a young second lieutenant who commands a tank troop in 1 rtr and has yet to serve a stint in the jnbc , takes a similar line to brooks .
he joined not out of any abstract notion of service to the nation but because he has always loved tanks .
he sees himself motivated more by patriotism and by loyalty to friends and comrades - though as the country 's figurehead the queen clearly comes into it somewhere .
the commanding officer , lt col patrick kidd , says the regiment is like a close-knit family , with the queen as its head .
but he also says that what drives individuals is principally their relationship with the other members of that close-knit team .
certainly the oldest member of the regiment thinks things have changed in recent years .
abstract notion warrant office mike taylor is still in post after 34 years at the age of 51 .
despite his grey hair he is the very picture of a senior nco .
he served as an assistant parade marshal during the queen mother 's funeral and was immensely proud to have done so .
as society has changed , and the old habits of deference to authority and unspoken loyalty to the queen have disappeared from civilian life , so the character of new recruits has changed , he thinks .
they join for the adventure , the travel and the job security , not out of abstract notions of service , he believes , and it worries him .
the day the armed forces lose their reverence for tradition , and for traditional values , is the day we should all start to worry , he says .
but with stalwart figures like wo taylor around , you feel , there is little danger of that .

the three tenors have said this will be the last of their joint world cup concerts , which started 12 years ago in rome .
on wednesday , pavarotti , 66 , announced he would retire on his 70th birthday , 12 october 2005 , following speculation that he wanted to end his singing career .
it was thought to be the first time the opera star had publicly discussed the date of his own retirement .
the most popular artist in the history of the classical recording industry , pavarotti recently cancelled a number of engagements , including an appearance at new york 's metropolitan opera house .
and he joked that after that date , " i never sing even in the bathroom , not even when i 'm taking a shower " .
he also said he is planning to marry nicoletta mantovani , 32 , his companion of six years , and added the couple is thinking about having children - " one or two or 10 " .
" i proposed to her several years ago , " he said .
" she says yes .
and she still say yes - i think she 's a masochist . "
pavarotti 's 34-year marriage to his wife , adua , ended after photographs of him with ms mantovani were published .
his three daughters from his marriage are all older than his fiancée .
referring to criticism for pulling out of what was rumoured to be his last appearance at the new york met on 11 may , pavarotti said he had been ill with laryngitis and could not talk .
" it 's stupid , absolutely stupid , to make such a big fuss , " he said .

researchers at sunderland university questioned the parents of 4,000 sufferers of autism across the country .
their results led them to believe at least 10 % of the cases of autism were triggered by the controversial triple mumps , measles and rubella vaccine .
most of the research has not been published and the team behind the study say more work is needed by other scientists .
during the study the researchers used an eight-page questionnaire to quiz the parents .
they also took urine samples and found those who had received the vaccine had different levels of a particular protein .
the study is at odds with a recent published review of previous research , which found no evidence that mmr is associated with autism .
epidemic fears earlier this month , a team led by dr anna donald and dr vivek muthu produced research into mmr which they had gathered from 180 countries around the world . "
our advice remains that mmr is the best way to protect children against measles , mumps and rubella " department of health they found no evidence to suggest mmr or single measles vaccines were associated with either autism or inflammatory bowel disease .
and just last week it was claimed that a controversial scientist alleging a link between the mmr vaccine and autism had failed to help officials verify his work .
doctors in london are worried about the risk of a measles epidemic and there are concerns about the low numbers of children being given the mmr vaccine .
there were 16 new cases of measles in the capital in may alone .
more than 70 % of children in london have been given the mmr jab , but the government target is 90 % .
experts say mmr can protect 90 % of all children who have an initial vaccination , while a second dose raises the level of protection from measles to 99 % .
dr paul shattock , director of the autism research unit at sunderland university , said the evidence that mmr was linked to autism was strong - but not conclusive .
claims dismissed however , dr peter dukes , research strategy manager at the medical research council , said there was plenty of independent research to suggest that mmr was not linked to autism .
he told the bbc : " there is strong positive evidence of no link . "
a spokesperson for the department of health stressed that the sunderland research was still work in progress , and had not been vetted by other scientists .
" the british medical journal recently commissioned and published the most comprehensive review yet of all the epidemiological evidence in this area .
" this confirmed earlier studies that the scientific evidence finds no link between mmr and autism or inflammatory bowel disease .
last december the government pledged £ 2.5 million towards further research into the causes of autism .
" we will continue to keep all the evidence under review .

the money will be used to maintain upland footpaths across the country to give walkers better access to scottish mountains .
the extra cash has been made available by the heritage lottery fund and will be used by the national trust for scotland to carry out a five-year programme of path repair .
it will improve public access at the same time as reducing its impact on the natural landscape of the mountains , which the trust has called some of the finest in the world .
national trust chief executive robin pellew said : " this is absolutely wonderful news .
" this support represents a huge public affirmation of the worthiness of the trust 's determination to secure sustainability for its mountains . "
six mountainous properties owned by the national trust will benefit - glencoe , ben lawers , ben lomond , goatfell , torridon , and kintail .
they need concerted attention because of the volume of workers that tramp over them annually .
the trust said it now hoped to obtain further funding to help maintain mountain pathways .
more than 1.7 million people visit scotland 's mountains every year .

the shares of railtrack group have been re-listed on the london stock exchange , nine months after its subsidiary - network operator railtrack - was put into administration .
bbc business correspondent russel hayes explains what 's behind the move .
all that 's left of railtrack group is a husk - why bother to re-list its shares at all ?
it does seem odd .
railtrack group has now lost its main assets , the network operator railtrack plc , and phase 1 of the channel tunnel rail link .
but it is still a public company with 515 million issued shares .
stock market rules require that , unless there is a compelling reason , shareholders should be allowed to buy and sell them .
trading was suspended last october , because of the huge uncertainty caused by railtrack plc being put into administration .
today 's deal means that doubt has now been removed .
but with so little of the company left , what are the shares likely to be worth ?
its main businesses have gone , that 's true .
but of course they 've got cash for them , which is now in the bank .
there are also two assets left ; a collection of prime development land around railway stations , and £ 350m in cash already in its account .
when you add that to the money it has received today , it comes to about £ 1.3bn , which is about £ 2.50 a share .
so will they actually sell for that ?
not a chance .
railtrack group ca n't continue as a company , so it 's plan is to also sell its property portfolio and close itself down - so it can hand the £ 2.50 a share back to shareholders .
but the first instalment will not be received until january 2003 .
in the meantime , uncertainties over how much the property will sell for , possible legal action from shareholder groups and other liabilities , mean they 'll be worth considerably less .
who would possibly want to buy railtrack shares ?
anyone who thinks they can make money out of them .
provided the price does n't fall much below £ 2.25 , quite a few shareholders will probably decide it 's worth cashing-in now rather than waiting until november for a possible £ 2.50 .
that would create an opportunity for anyone who thinks the money they could make by buying now and holding the shares until the pay-out is worth the risk .
in reality this means hedge funds and other professional investors .
but if the price is much above £ 2.25 , then the profit would not cover the commission or the risk .
that 's why it 's expected the shares will trade in a range of £ 2.25-2.30 .
how does the government justify subsidising the deal after pledging that it would n't ?
the then transport secretary stephen byers got into a real hole over this one .
whether his decision to place railtrack into administration brought down railtrack group is a hotly debated point .
but it did lead to the suspension of the shares , and howls of protest from shareholders , worried that they had lost most of their money .
it also severely damaged the government 's relations with the private sector , at a time when ministers were relying on it to finance many new public sector projects .
so after initially saying there would be no taxpayers ' money to help shareholders , mr byers relented and put up £ 300m to help network rail buy railtrack .
a blatant u-turn ?
no , he said .
the money would have been spent anyway on court cases and the costs of keeping railtrack in administration which are about £ 1m a day .
the government 's critics though say the money is a bribe , to try to repair its relations with the city . ^ ^ back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- feedback -pipe- ©

the r & b star , who was released on $ 750,000 -lrb- £ 513,500 -rrb- bail after his arrest on 5 june in florida , is accused of appearing in a video showing him having sex with an underage girl .
the video has been widely distributed in the us and over the internet .
mr kelly says he is not the man on the 26-minute tape .
if found guilty , mr kelly could face up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 100,000 -lrb- £ 68,500 -rrb- .
another hearing was set for 7 august and mr kelly remained free on bond , as he has been since shortly after his arrest .
mr kelly , whose first name is robert , made no statement during his court appearance .
but he smiled and waved to fans who lined the corridor of the cook county courthouse , many of whom wore t-shirts reading : " r kelly we luv you . "
sam adam , one of the singer 's lawyers , told reporters outside the court that his client was innocent .
song cook county state 's attorney richard devine says the video was made in november 1997 or later and that the girl involved was born in september 1984 .
a week ago , the grammy award-winning singer released a song to a chicago radio station stating his innocence .
in the song , heaven , i need a hug he criticises his detractors and says he hopes to regain his fans ' support .
his defence lawyer , edward genson , says he will prove that the woman on the tape was not younger than 18 .
mr kelly - who was discovered busking in the chicago underground system - has become a best-selling singer and producer .
his best-known songs include i believe i can fly and if i could turn back the hands of time , and he has worked with michael and janet jackson .
controversy chicago is mr kelly 's home town .
following his arrest , one of chicago 's top music stations dropped his music from its playlist .
a survey of local residents showed that 56 % of people thought all radio stations should do the same .
the r & b star has been ordered to avoid contact with children he is not related to and to check in with police once a week .
he has been hit with a string of legal cases from women who say the star had sex with them when they were below the legal age of consent .
