he made the claim after mr sixsmith said he never agreed to leave the department and is considering returning to work as its chief press officer on monday .
shadow transport secretary theresa may said the latest twist in the row about " burying " bad news proves mr byers has lost control of his department and that he should quit .
but speaking on itv1 's dimbleby programme , the minister insisted he had done no wrong and called on members of the public to judge him at the election for his work to improve transport and housing .
' fresh start ' mr byers said the resignations of mr sixsmith and special adviser jo moore were a " personnel matter " for his permanent secretary , sir richard mottram , to deal with . "
his department is in absolute chaos , there 's no trust between ministers and civil servants " theresa may he said ms moore had had enough and wanted to go , adding : " i also felt in order to have a fresh start in the department because confidence had been lost , there was n't the trust that needed to be there , that it would be good if martin sixsmith went as well .

mr byers admitted " it certainly would have made my life a lot easier " if ms moore had been sacked over her " bad news " 11 september email .
" but whether it would have been the right thing i think is a question of judgement , " he added .
the shadow transport secretary called on mr byers to quit in light of the new claims .
ms may told the bbc : " i think it is quite clear he is incapable of running his department .
" his department is in absolute chaos , there 's no trust between ministers and civil servants , he compromised the impartiality of civil servants and i think it 's clearly a resigning matter . "
scottish secretary , helen liddel , told the same programme the row proved the communications side of that department was dysfunctional and needed sorting out .
' alarmed ' the " spin row " controversy resurfaced on saturday night when mr sixsmith said : " i was n't sacked , i did n't resign , i have n't offered my resignation .
" so when -lsb- stephen byers -rsb- announced it , he was in the very least mistaken . "
he said that on 15 february , sir richard had asked him to resign with ms moore .
mr sixsmith said he would consider it , but later that day he heard on the radio that both he and ms moore had quit .
" i was somewhat alarmed by that .
i asked to see byers but he would n't see me , " he said .
sir richard , he said , then told him he was sorry but there had been a " complete cock-up " , and someone had leaked the news of two resignations .
accusations the row began with a reported disagreement between mr sixsmith and ms moore over whether rail statistics should be published on the day of princess margaret 's funeral .
there were reports that mr sixsmith rebuked ms moore , who infamously wanted to " bury " bad news on 11 september , for planning to release bad rail figures on that day .
the affair led to accusations that the ministry was " at war " with itself , with staff leaking against each other , and that the neutrality of the civil service was being undermined .

china minsheng banking corp has acknowledged that it may never retrieve a sizeable slice of 354m yuan -lrb- $ 43m ; £ 30m -rrb- in loans it made to one of its own tellers .
the loans , the bank now says , were made between 1997 and 2000 on the basis of forged documents .
the shanghai-based teller , 29-year-old huang jin , is now in custody .
" we recovered some of the funds with police assistance , and will take further legal action soon , " minsheng said in a statement to shanghai securities news .
" our bank will use all means available to minimise losses from this instance . "
so far huang has repaid the bank about 246m yuan .
but the rest of the money may never be recovered .
no more mr clean the affair may damage minsheng , which last year saw net profits rise 60 % to 686m yuan and loans expand 90 % , over and above the financial loss .
the bank has traded on its position as sole private lender , claiming that the discipline of the private sector means its risk control beats that of state banks hands down .
that claim may be rather more difficult to pursue from now on - even though this scandal pales beside those at public sector banks .
bank of china was last month fined $ 20m by regulators in both the us and china after a decade of suspect loans totalling more than 6bn yuan .
minsheng shares , which can only be owned by domestic investors , were down about 4 % .

daikyo and towa real estate development are both deep in the red thanks to the plummeting property market in japan since the economic bubble of the 1980s burst a decade ago .
but now , the papers claim , their banks are ready to bail them out .
koizumi : reform plans under fire and that prospect worries observers already concerned about whether the government is prepared to make the tough calls on economic reform .
noises from kasumigaseki , the tokyo neighbourhood which houses most of the national government , indicate that the banking sector will after all get an injection of state funds .
but that is likely further to dent the government 's popularity should the banks prove unwilling to crack down on their problem loans themselves .
rescue according to the papers , condominium developer daikyo could get as much as 400bn yen -lrb- $ 3bn ; £ 2.1bn -rrb- from its lead bank , ufj , and other lenders .
towa , meanwhile , is looking for waivers and debt-for-equity swaps worth 200bn yen , mostly from ufj and sumitomo mitsui .
its total debts amount to 521.2bn yen , despite a 290bn yen waiver it received in march 1999 .
and misawa homes , a third builder , said over the weekend that it could be looking for a bailout of its own - the second in just three years .
shaky foundations the reason these suggestions cause such concern is that the construction sector constitutes one of japan inc 's biggest black holes .
last month , custom-made house builder shokusan jutaku sogo asked the courts for protection from its creditors with debts totalling 13.5bn yen .
and aoki corp , another construction firm , was given debt forgiveness early in 2001 , but still went bust in december as demand slackened and its debts piled up .
but that is only the tip of the iceberg .
construction firms took advantage of the massive property price boom of the 1980s , borrowing astronomical sums from their lead banks .
the close relationship between the firms and their lenders meant risk oversight was minimal .
state help the sector has been kept artificially afloat over the past decade by huge injections of government money intended to pump-prime the economy .
but much of the cash has gone on make-work public works projects with little long-term economic benefit .
construction companies and general contractors are traditionally close to the liberal democratic party , which has ruled japan - with only one short break of less than a year - even since 1955 .
firesale behaviour at bankrupt retailer mycal the construction " zoku " , or tribe , as the industry 's many supporters in the ldp are termed , have over the years received vast sums in election expenses and other inducements , and have made sure their friends keep their chins just above water .
the fact that some parts of the construction industry is also very closely allied with japan 's 80,000-strong army of professional gangsters , known as the yakuza , has also helped keep banks and government regulators off their backs .
more to come ...
whatever happens to daikyo and towa , bankruptcy is now a way of life in japan .
in 2001 , 14 companies listed on the tokyo stock exchange went under , including mycal , the country 's fourth biggest supermarket , with debts of as much as 1,700bn yen .
and daiei , a leading japanese retailer , is now working on a three-year plan to pull itself around .
it could get even worse after april , when the government removes the unlimited deposit guarantees which have protected the banking system up to now .

the research by one of the government 's top advisers on the disease has found it is virtually impossible that bse can be passed from an infected cow to her calf .
professor john wilesmith fears that as there has been a ban on feeding cattle meat and bone meal in britain since 1996 any contamination must be coming from another source - possibly infected cargo .
in professor wilesmith 's experiments , embryos from cows that had the disease were fertilised with semen from infected bulls and put in the womb of surrogate cows .
none of the calves or the surrogate mothers contracted bse .
experimental results the bbc reporter sarah mukherjee said : " this research is seen as good news by the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- .
" but it begs the question why cows are still getting the disease - about 500 last year in britain and hundreds across europe . "
professor wilesmith , from the veterinary laboratories agency , told bbc radio 4 's farming today programme : " if maternal transmission is occurring , then we have no idea how because everything we have looked at in terms of excretions and secretions from cows have all proved negative .
" my working hypothesis is that we are still dealing with cross contamination but not from a british source but from ships importing -lsb- feed -rsb- into britain . "
banned feed professor wilesmith 's theory of bone meal contamination is supported by a report presented to the european parliament earlier this month .
that study said farmers in member states were still feeding their cattle meat and bone meal , which was banned by the eu in 1994 .
bse in cattle is believed to be linked to variant creutzfeldt-jacob disease -lrb- cjd -rrb- in humans , which is invariably fatal .
many scientists believe the disease can be passed to humans through infected meat .
according to the uk creutzfeldt-jakob disease surveillance unit in edinburgh , there have been 104 vcjd deaths in britain since 1995 and nine people have the disease at present .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- obesity link to birth defects categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 25 february , 2002 , 08:17 gmt obesity link to birth defects obesity among women is increasing women who are obese before pregnancy are risking the health of themselves and their unborn child , according to a study .
obese women can develop gestational diabetes , high blood pressure and need to be hospitalised during pregnancy .
their babies can be born prematurely or suffer serious birth defects and other severe problems , says dr richard deckelbaum , professor of nutrition at new york 's columbia university .
weight before pregnancy matters much more than people realise dr richard deckelbaum this has special significance for the uk , where obesity among women of childbearing age is continuing to rise .
dr deckelbaum said : " weight before pregnancy matters much more than people realise , even health professionals . "
he is particularly concerned about the health of babies born to obese women .
he said : " when these babies grow up , they are more likely to suffer from obesity , cardiovascular disease , diabetes and other health problems .
" obesity is particularly dangerous for women of childbearing age because it creates a life cycle of serious problems that can be passed from generation to generation . "
dr deckelbaum urges women to prepare for their future children by eating " family friendly " or " baby friendly " portion sizes to reduce calorie intake and to limit second helpings of food .
he also advocates more physical exercise for women .
obesity ' epidemic ' the international obesity task force -lrb- iotf -rrb- says this report reinforces their concerns over the growing problem of obesity .
it suggests england has been leading the world in the speed at which obesity has been growing .
the iotf 's director of policy neville rigby said : " a high proportion of young girls are becoming obese in the uk .
" they need to look at incorporating exercise and better eating and nutrition into their lifestyle , not just for themselves but of future generations . "
obesity has crept up from 7 % of the uk population in 1980 to 21 % in 2002 .
in 1993 , 11 % of women in the prime childbearing age range o 25-34 were obese .
by 2000 , the rate had jumped to 16 % .

obese women can develop gestational diabetes , high blood pressure and need to be hospitalised during pregnancy .
their babies can be born prematurely or suffer serious birth defects and other severe problems , says dr richard deckelbaum , professor of nutrition at new york 's columbia university . "
weight before pregnancy matters much more than people realise " dr richard deckelbaum this has special significance for the uk , where obesity among women of childbearing age is continuing to rise .
dr deckelbaum said : " weight before pregnancy matters much more than people realise , even health professionals . "
he is particularly concerned about the health of babies born to obese women .
he said : " when these babies grow up , they are more likely to suffer from obesity , cardiovascular disease , diabetes and other health problems .
" obesity is particularly dangerous for women of childbearing age because it creates a life cycle of serious problems that can be passed from generation to generation . "
dr deckelbaum urges women to prepare for their future children by eating " family friendly " or " baby friendly " portion sizes to reduce calorie intake and to limit second helpings of food .
he also advocates more physical exercise for women .
obesity ' epidemic ' the international obesity task force -lrb- iotf -rrb- says this report reinforces their concerns over the growing problem of obesity .
it suggests england has been leading the world in the speed at which obesity has been growing .
the iotf 's director of policy neville rigby said : " a high proportion of young girls are becoming obese in the uk .
" they need to look at incorporating exercise and better eating and nutrition into their lifestyle , not just for themselves but of future generations . "

the film , which stars russell crowe as john nash and jennifer connelly as his wife alicia , has won four oscars , including best film , best director and best supporting actress .
howard 's film portrays nash as an intellectually brilliant man , who succumbed to schizophrenia for many years and then finally triumphed over his illness , winning a nobel prize in 1994 .
this interpretation is wrong , according to new york-based film critic charles taylor .
the film is loosely based on a biography of the same age he claims nash admitted he never made a total recovery from his illness and hollywood is trying to turn his life story into an unconditional triumph .
taylor , who reviews films for salon.com , says : " it 's been conceived as something to make audiences weep and to win oscars . "
' love conquers all ' the new york times critic who praised certain aspects of a beautiful mind also found that the story was " almost entirely counterfeit . "
other reviewers complained nash 's recovery from schizophrenia was presented too much in terms of a " love conquers all " narrative .
in defending their picture , the film-makers insist a beautiful mind is not a biography , but a human drama " inspired " by events in john nash 's life .
jennifer connelly plays alicia nash director ron howard says : " it is very true in terms of his life .
it 's not his complete life .
" all the scenes are not the absolute words that john nash said , but then again , the sweep of his life , the architecture of his life , is very true to what he and his wife alicia have dealt with . "
but critics say it airbrushes away certain uncomfortable realities .
nash and his wife divorced , before remarrying last year , but this is never mentioned in the film .
neither is the fact that he nash fathered a child with another woman and then reportedly abandoned them both .
also nash was arrested in the 1950 's for soliciting sex in a men 's public lavatory , and also had a number of apparently sexual liaisons with men , but these details too have been omitted .
' not relevant ' screenwriter akiva goldsman maintains all these aspects of nash 's life were left out because they just were n't relevant to the basic thrust of the screenplay .
goldsman says , " john did or did n't have sexual relationships with men .
according to john , he did n't .
crowe won a golden globe for his role " but in any case , it was n't what the story was about .
john also had a wife , a long relationship with another woman and another son .
all these incidents occurred outside the context of the story that we 're telling .
" our story is about one abiding relationship - john and alicia - and the way that relationship carried him through his journey to healing . "
syliva nasar , who wrote the biography on which the film is partly based , thinks much of the criticism misses the point .
she believes the picture presents a valuable and realistic portrait of schizophrenia that is rarely seen .
nasar says : " this is the first time someone with this illness not only survives it , and triumphs over it but is seen as a fully multi-dimensional human being who 's loved .
that 's amazing .
" i think anyone who knows , either through personal experience or otherwise , about this illness that is what 's amazing about the movie . "
nasar does not stand alone in this assessment because many mental health professionals have confirmed the film gives a very accurate portrayal of a person suffering from paranoid schizophrenia .
but critic charles taylor says that alone " does n't make it a good movie " .
" movies are not public service announcements .
if you 're saying ' i 'm going to go and present a positive image of mental illness , ' you 're really in the advertising business , " he says .
defending the film : producer brian grazer and ron howard ' jeopardy ' in previous years similar films which have had the veracity of their storytelling challenged have found the negative criticism jeopardised their oscar chances .
but this seems unlikely to happen with a beautiful mind .
john nash has seen the film and , according to his biographer , really likes it .
the picture also has many admirers who believe the essential truth of nash 's story has been preserved .
russell crowe and jennifer connelly 's acting has been widely praised and won several awards on the road to the oscars .
akiva goldsman 's ingenious screenplay has its fans , as well as detractors .
finally , ron howard 's time has come .

there was no serious congestion as blackburn and tottenham fans arrived at the millennium stadium in plenty of time for the game .
despite the rain there were few traffic problems there was a touch of history as the game - which blackburn won two-one - was played under the stadium 's closed retractable roof because of heavy rain .
south wales police said they made five arrests following the match .
three men from northern england were arrested for assaulting another man from the north of england .
one man from the swansea area was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and another man from the north of england was arrested for a public order offence .
however , the whole event and policing operation has been hailed as a success , with officers reporting a ' carnival ' atmosphere around the city and a good-natured attitude from the visiting fans of both teams .
a major traffic operation was organised following the embarrassing delays which marred the 2001 final .
many fans missed the start of that game - the first major football event ever held at the millennium stadium .
lessons learned senior officers said measures had been put in place to ensure there was no disruption to the build-up for the 2002 final .
the main traffic problem before the match was a tailback of around a mile on the m50 motorway in herefordshire which held up some blackburn fans travelling from the north of england .
the millennium stadium is winning a good reputation police warned people to be patient on their way home on sunday evening after the game .
they said the m4 , rail services and all major routes heading north and east from cardiff were likely to be busy .
but officers praised the behaviour of supporters , saying there had been no trouble and no arrests .
last year , birmingham and liverpool fans held up in traffic congestion arrived angry and frustrated at the stadium having missed the first half of the match .
the police later admitted they had expected hundreds more coaches and rail passengers for the 2001 final and they were unprepared for the volume of cars .

only history will tell the consequences of the death of jonas savimbi , but at this stage it is safe to predict that they will be profound and complicated .
for the government , savimbi 's death makes life simultaneously easier and more difficult .
there is one large drawback to losing its arch-enemy - it also loses its best excuse for the fact that a country of such natural wealth has one of the lowest standards of living in the world .
without the alibi of a war budget , luanda will be under pressure at home and abroad to ensure that a decent proportion of the country 's oil earnings goes towards improving the lives of angolans .
and the continued delaying of elections - angolans last voted in 1992 - will be increasingly difficult to justify .
the government has promised elections this year or next year , as long as the situation in the country allows the free movement of people and goods .
most observers agree that this is a reasonable proviso - but the onus is now much more clearly on the government to ensure that these conditions are met . "
the government is much more likely to be able to have peace on its own terms " at the same time , a militarily weakened unita strengthens the hand of the government , making it better able to determine , on its own , the shape of a future angola .
savimbi died at a time when united nations officials had been saying that the rebel leadership was creeping towards the acceptance of a negotiated settlement .
with savimbi out of the way , the government is much more likely to be able to have peace on its own terms .
this prospect will be greeted with dismay by those who had hoped that a peace plan would also include mechanisms to broaden democracy in angola .
recently churches , civic organisations and traditional chiefs have been demanding that all groups within society , and not just the two warring parties , be allowed a say in angola 's future .
within unita , the death of savimbi is being greeted with quiet relief by some members of the movement who , after the 1992 election , stayed on as politicians in luanda rather than follow their leader back to war .
without a man like savimbi at the top , unita would never have lasted as long as it did as a rebel army .
with the founder out of the way , the prospect of the the rebels disarming and reuniting with unita 's legal political wing under civilian leadership now seems better than ever before .
caution but after an initial mood of euphoria in luanda , few people are still predicting that savimbi 's death will bring an immediate end to the war .
their caution is well founded , since over the years , the angolan conflict has taken on a momentum of its own .
unita guerrillas have been operating in many regions of angola , reliant on looting and ambushing for their survival .
often they are barely distinguishable from ordinary bandits .
and after so many years under savimbi 's domination , the new unita leadership could have a hard time asserting its authority .
if future leaders decide to follow the path of peace , they may find it difficult to persuade the scattered unita forces to give up their guns .
