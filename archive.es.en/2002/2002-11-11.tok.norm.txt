program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2002 germany 's opposition leader receives strong party endorsement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - a woman on top germany 's most powerful woman in politics , angela merkel , accuses gerhard schröder 's government of blatant lies as her christian democratic union looks to reinvent itself . monday saw germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , hunker down for its one-day party conference in the northern city of hanover .
actually , make that one-person conference , for although the party base was asked to vote in the cdu 's new leadership and the party presidium , the main focus of interest was rather more parochial than that .
all eyes were on angela merkel , whose formal re-election with 93.7 percent of the vote as party leader by the 1,000 delegates was a foregone conclusion .
never one for mincing her words , merkel in her address accused chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic-led government of lying to voters .
" this government has blatantly and cold-bloodedly lied into the faces of the german people .
they have been deceived like never before , " she said .
continuing in a similar vein she said that germany had reached a " post-war lowpoint " economically , socially and morally .
the country 's future , she warned , was at stake .
strong words from a strong-willed woman .
having unceremoniously muscled and bustled her way past potential post-election stumbling blocks such as friedrich merz , the former parliamentary group chairman , merkel is shaping up to turn the party into her platform from where she can launch her bid to become chancellor candidate .
merkel seen as party saviour for there are many within the cdu who overtly opine that the feisty 48-year-old from the eastern german state of brandenburg , would indeed have made a better chancellor candidate than edmund stoiber , leader of the cdu 's smaller conservative sister party , the christian social union .
the most vociferous in the pro-merkel camp say that her eastern roots would have guaranteed the party a high percentage of votes from women in eastern germany , an area which stoiber dramatically failed to tap into at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel can merkel be the cdu 's saviour ?
observers say that the party is still struggling to come to terms with its narrow election defeat two months ago and needs a strong , dominating figure to position it as a modern , centrist party , with emphasis on christian and family values .
fast rise to the top merkel seems better-placed than anyone to assume that mantle .
the daughter of a pastor , she got her first taste of politics working for an eastern german organization under the aegis of the protestant church just prior to reunification .
she joined the cdu in 1990 and quickly rose through the ranks impressing her political allies and foes alike with her unassuming , yet determined manner .
she quickly caught the attention of former chancellor helmut kohl who took her under his guiding wing and , appointed her minister of women and youth affairs in 1991 .
she worked her way through various political posts , including a stint as environment minister , honing her political instinct .
after the cdu was dumped from power in 1998 , she became the chief party whip , realigning the party in her pet competencies of family , education and social policies .
not long afterward , she took advantage of the illegal donations scandal surrounding kohl and then party chairman wolfgang schäuble to demand a much-publicized break with the past , a barely veiled barb at cdu party grandees such as kohl and schäuble .
it is a sign of her political savvy that she has personally pushed for schäuble 's appointment as a co-chairman and the party 's spokesman on foreign and european affairs .
the party base thanked her for it and helped her become the first ever woman in german politics to lead a party .
although political commentators have in the past criticized her leadership style as being too timid and hesitant , she is increasingly proving her detractors wrong that she is too thin-skinned for the job .
new strategies for now , it 's all about strategies and while many in the cdu are clamoring for a long-term realignment of the party , her focus is clearly on the upcoming state elections in hesse and lower saxony next year .
merkel wants to turn the polls into a plebiscite on schröder 's dismal record so far .
with unemployment spiralling out of control , a mounting public debt and imminent tax hikes , opinion polls show that merkel and her party would win if the federal election were held this week .
merkel knows her party must take advantage of the present disgruntled state of the electorate to reposition the cdu as a functioning and united opposition party and a future ruling party .
but merkel will no doubt be looking ahead , indeed a special party conference is already being lined up for next year which will focus on the cdu 's long-term strategy .
her own strategy right now has to be to survive a much-predicted onslaught on her leadership qualities by roland koch , premier of the state of hesse and her main challenger to a chancellor candidacy .
if she passes that test , observers say she has a real chance of leading the party successfully through a programmatic readjustment making it a viable and attractive alternative to the social democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de selling the conservative family ’ s silver ?
opposition leader angela merkel 's calls for her party to focus more on families and the environment to woo voters away from the greens and social democrats have spurred a major split among christian democrats .

actually , make that one-person conference , for although the party base was asked to vote in the cdu 's new leadership and the party presidium , the main focus of interest was rather more parochial than that .
all eyes were on angela merkel , whose formal re-election with 93.7 percent of the vote as party leader by the 1,000 delegates was a foregone conclusion .
never one for mincing her words , merkel in her address accused chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic-led government of lying to voters .
" this government has blatantly and cold-bloodedly lied into the faces of the german people .
they have been deceived like never before , " she said .
continuing in a similar vein she said that germany had reached a " post-war lowpoint " economically , socially and morally .
the country 's future , she warned , was at stake .
strong words from a strong-willed woman .
having unceremoniously muscled and bustled her way past potential post-election stumbling blocks such as friedrich merz , the former parliamentary group chairman , merkel is shaping up to turn the party into her platform from where she can launch her bid to become chancellor candidate .
merkel seen as party saviour for there are many within the cdu who overtly opine that the feisty 48-year-old from the eastern german state of brandenburg , would indeed have made a better chancellor candidate than edmund stoiber , leader of the cdu 's smaller conservative sister party , the christian social union .
the most vociferous in the pro-merkel camp say that her eastern roots would have guaranteed the party a high percentage of votes from women in eastern germany , an area which stoiber dramatically failed to tap into at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel can merkel be the cdu 's saviour ?
observers say that the party is still struggling to come to terms with its narrow election defeat two months ago and needs a strong , dominating figure to position it as a modern , centrist party , with emphasis on christian and family values .
fast rise to the top merkel seems better-placed than anyone to assume that mantle .
the daughter of a pastor , she got her first taste of politics working for an eastern german organization under the aegis of the protestant church just prior to reunification .
she joined the cdu in 1990 and quickly rose through the ranks impressing her political allies and foes alike with her unassuming , yet determined manner .
she quickly caught the attention of former chancellor helmut kohl who took her under his guiding wing and , appointed her minister of women and youth affairs in 1991 .
she worked her way through various political posts , including a stint as environment minister , honing her political instinct .
after the cdu was dumped from power in 1998 , she became the chief party whip , realigning the party in her pet competencies of family , education and social policies .
not long afterward , she took advantage of the illegal donations scandal surrounding kohl and then party chairman wolfgang schäuble to demand a much-publicized break with the past , a barely veiled barb at cdu party grandees such as kohl and schäuble .
it is a sign of her political savvy that she has personally pushed for schäuble 's appointment as a co-chairman and the party 's spokesman on foreign and european affairs .
the party base thanked her for it and helped her become the first ever woman in german politics to lead a party .
although political commentators have in the past criticized her leadership style as being too timid and hesitant , she is increasingly proving her detractors wrong that she is too thin-skinned for the job .
new strategies for now , it 's all about strategies and while many in the cdu are clamoring for a long-term realignment of the party , her focus is clearly on the upcoming state elections in hesse and lower saxony next year .
merkel wants to turn the polls into a plebiscite on schröder 's dismal record so far .
with unemployment spiralling out of control , a mounting public debt and imminent tax hikes , opinion polls show that merkel and her party would win if the federal election were held this week .
merkel knows her party must take advantage of the present disgruntled state of the electorate to reposition the cdu as a functioning and united opposition party and a future ruling party .
but merkel will no doubt be looking ahead , indeed a special party conference is already being lined up for next year which will focus on the cdu 's long-term strategy .
her own strategy right now has to be to survive a much-predicted onslaught on her leadership qualities by roland koch , premier of the state of hesse and her main challenger to a chancellor candidacy .
if she passes that test , observers say she has a real chance of leading the party successfully through a programmatic readjustment making it a viable and attractive alternative to the social democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de selling the conservative family ’ s silver ?
opposition leader angela merkel 's calls for her party to focus more on families and the environment to woo voters away from the greens and social democrats have spurred a major split among christian democrats .

charles faber has claimed he was victimised by cardiff county council after revealing his concerns to the bbc wales programme , week in week out .
the authority has always maintained it sacked charles faber because of financial mismanagement .
councillors alleged he paid himself more than £ 20,000 overtime in one year .
but mr faber and his union have claimed he was fired for going public with concerns about the council 's children 's services department .
he told week in week out that he felt vulnerable children in cardiff were slipping through the net and had been abandoned by social services .
' unacceptable ' in march , more than 3,000 council staff went out on strike in support of mr faber .
six months later , a report by the audit commission agreed that cardiff 's social services department was exposing vulnerable children to unacceptable risks .
the tribunal hearing , which will be held in cardiff , is expected to last four days .
in august it emerged that a row had broken out over the legal bill the council had run up during legal action against staff who were sacked after raising concerns about care services .
' valid criticisms ' a senior opposition councillor in cardiff claimed the local authority had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds with a private law firm defending cases brought by employees who have been suspended or sacked .
but gareth neale , leader of the conservative group on the council , suggested the failings pointed out by the whistleblowing workers had proved valid criticisms of the city 's social services .
he said senior cardiff councillors and council officials are in a " state of denial " over the shortcomings in the city 's services for caring for children and the elderly .
mr neale said the taxpayers ' cash which the local authority has spent on legal fees - estimated at £ 500,000 - could have been used on the services which are soon to be the subject of a report by the audit commission and the assembly 's social services inspectorate .

in a letter to chancellor gordon brown , cbi director general digby jones called on monday for tax restraint , saying that businesses have been hit by " relentless and damaging " rise in corporate levies .
the cbi estimated that tax rises brought in since the labour government came to power in 1997 will have cost british firms £ 47bn by 2005 .
when the cost of complying with a raft of new business regulations brought in by labour is factored in , the total cost to uk companies could rise to £ 15bn a year , the cbi has calculated .
" where taxes go from here could be the biggest test yet of the government 's pro-business credentials , " mr jones said .
hard times " ministers can not keep siphoning off company funds without damaging investment productivity and competitiveness . "
he urged the government to make up any shortfall in its revenues through extra borrowing rather than new taxes .
the cbi 's strongly worded warning comes amid falling business investment and weakening economic growth , and foreshadows mr brown 's annual pre-budget report , due out later this month .
the organisation has been one of the most vociferous critics of the labour government 's record on business taxes and red tape .
it has protested particularly strongly against taxes , such as national insurance contributions , which are administered by employers through the company payroll .
rival business lobby the institute of directors is also planning to plead for a halt to higher taxes ahead of the pre-budget report .

more than 150,000 people are expected to watch the sport 's top drivers in action over 17 stages which begins on thursday and takes place at locations across south east and west wales .
organisers say only people with tickets will be allowed in to watch the stages .
for the first time a dedicated spectator safety officer has been appointed , who will work alongside an event safety officer .
the four-day event - the final round of the world rally championship - is based in cardiff for the second year in succession , and stages will also be run across south west wales . "
it is a dangerous sport and it is also up to spectators to look out for their own safety as well " sue sanders-peppitt , spectator safety organisers have introduced a number of measures to prevent a repeat of last year 's incident in which a 13-year-old girl suffered a broken leg .
the accident happened when carlos sainz 's car came off the track on a bend in the brechfa forest in carmarthenshire .
sue sanders-peppitt is in charge of spectator safety for this year 's event .
she said : " there has been a lot of good safety practice over the years but we have introduced consistency to the whole event .
" we have tried to allow people to be as close to the action as is deemed acceptable .
' exciting ' " it is a dangerous sport and it is also up to spectators to look out for their own safety as well .
" people who buy tickets for the events want to get something exciting out of it and we have to guarantee that they can see something .
" what we have done is to pick viewing areas for their excitement and then make them as safe as possible .
" they will only be allowed on the outside of a bend if there is a high back there .
" forest enterprise has also put in place walkways between special viewing areas so people do n't go on the competitive routes to the next vantage point and trees have been cleared to provide better views , " she added .
nearly 4,500 voluntary marshals will be on duty during the rally - fewer than last year because spectators will be limited to the designated viewing areas within stages .
the new safety measures include : dedicated spectator safety officer ticket only entry registered marshals designated spectator viewing areas forest walkways risk assessment of viewing areas related to this story : rally organisers meet about crash -lrb- 26 jan 02 -pipe- wales -rrb- rally victim undergoes surgery -lrb- 27 nov 01 -pipe- wales -rrb- rally fans recover in hospital -lrb- 26 nov 01 -pipe- wales -rrb- children hurt as rally car crashes -lrb- 24 nov 01 -pipe- wales -rrb- spectators airlifted as rally car crashes -lrb- 24 nov 01 -pipe- wales -rrb- internet links : network q rally of great britain -pipe- motorsports association events -pipe- world rally championship the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point uk news contents : england -pipe- n ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- politics -pipe- education -pipe- ^ ^ back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- feedback -pipe- ©

sue sanders-peppitt : in charge of spectator safety more than 150,000 people are expected to watch the sport 's top drivers in action over 17 stages which begins on thursday and takes place at locations across south east and west wales .
organisers say only people with tickets will be allowed in to watch the stages .
for the first time a dedicated spectator safety officer has been appointed , who will work alongside an event safety officer .
the four-day event - the final round of the world rally championship - is based in cardiff for the second year in succession , and stages will also be run across south west wales .
it is a dangerous sport and it is also up to spectators to look out for their own safety as well sue sanders-peppitt , spectator safety organisers have introduced a number of measures to prevent a repeat of last year 's incident in which a 13-year-old girl suffered a broken leg .
the accident happened when carlos sainz 's car came off the track on a bend in the brechfa forest in carmarthenshire .
sue sanders-peppitt is in charge of spectator safety for this year 's event .
she said : " there has been a lot of good safety practice over the years but we have introduced consistency to the whole event .
" we have tried to allow people to be as close to the action as is deemed acceptable .
' exciting ' " it is a dangerous sport and it is also up to spectators to look out for their own safety as well .
" people who buy tickets for the events want to get something exciting out of it and we have to guarantee that they can see something .
" what we have done is to pick viewing areas for their excitement and then make them as safe as possible .
" they will only be allowed on the outside of a bend if there is a high back there .
" forest enterprise has also put in place walkways between special viewing areas so people do n't go on the competitive routes to the next vantage point and trees have been cleared to provide better views , " she added .
nearly 4,500 voluntary marshals will be on duty during the rally - fewer than last year because spectators will be limited to the designated viewing areas within stages .
the new safety measures include : dedicated spectator safety officer ticket only entry registered marshals designated spectator viewing areas forest walkways risk assessment of viewing areas see also : 26 jan 02 -pipe- wales rally organisers meet about crash 27 nov 01 -pipe- wales rally victim undergoes surgery 26 nov 01 -pipe- wales rally fans recover in hospital 24 nov 01 -pipe- wales children hurt as rally car crashes 24 nov 01 -pipe- wales spectators airlifted as rally car crashes internet links : network q rally of great britain motorsports association events world rally championship the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : boyfriend sought in murder inquiry girl will wait for jailed ' rapist ' lover cash boost for brecon jazz hello !

despite the lack of native speakers in monmouthshire , the local council has been busy preparing its case for being the focal point for the 2010 event .

the national eisteddfod - the annual celebration of welsh song , dance and prose - last visited monmouthshire in 1913 , when abergavenny was the host town .

a report has been submitted to the eisteddfod council. witha decision expected to be reached at a meeting on 30 november .

there are currently three planning applications being made to build wind farms in the west of northern ireland .
the plan for the farm in fermanagh , at the knocks , would be the biggest on the island of ireland to date and local people are making clear their feelings about the proposal .
they say it would have a major impact on the scenery around the townland .
however , according to the company behind the proposal for a wind farm , the site at carricknabrattoge meets all the criteria .
there are currently three planning applications they say it is not designated for conservation , is a suitable distance from housing and is in a very windy area .
it is a trade-off between scenic value and green value , acknowledged by sasha workman from the company , b9 energy .
it is holding exhibitions at knocks and in nearby newtownbutler to allow residents to see what is being planned .
supply power but in the knocks , local people say they will not be easily persuaded .
earlier this year , several hundred people held a protest against plans to build a wind farm off the north coast of northern ireland .
the £ 200m project would be located in the sea between portstewart in county londonderry and donegal in the republic of ireland .
if successful , it could supply power to 170,000 homes , 28 % of all homes in northern ireland .
locals cite the beauty of the portstewart coastline however , the north coast is famous for its sea views and some residents feel " clean " energy would be generated to the detriment of tourism , one of the area 's main incomes .
the plans would involve constructing up to 85 turbines , each almost 200 feet tall .
if the project goes ahead , one third of the output of kilroot power station would be generated in what would be the largest off-shore wind farm in the uk .
a consortium has been appointed to investigate the feasibility of the project .
it is made up of b9 energy offshore developments , renewable energy systems and powergen renewables developments .
if initial exploration is successful , work to construct the wind farm could start in 2005 . watch / listen on this story bbc ni 's louise cullen : " it 's a trade-off between scenic value and green value " see also : 19 aug 02 -pipe- n ireland protest over wind farm plan 25 jun 02 -pipe- n ireland wind farm plan edges closer 12 nov 01 -pipe- uk q & a : wind and wave power 14 feb 02 -pipe- n ireland tourism fears over wind farm plan 14 feb 02 -pipe- scotland energy review to be published internet links : department of enterprise , trade and investment b9 energy the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top n ireland stories now : nail bombs thrown at station omagh detectives make arrest orde defends inquiry comments warders still concerned at breach sdlp member ' being forced out ' jobs threat at council family claim attack was ' sectarian ' adair fails in prison challenge links to more n ireland stories are at the foot of the page .

police said the suspect , known only as amrozi , studied under mr ba 'asyir when they were living in malaysia and that they had kept in contact .
according to amrozi , he and his group wanted to kill as many americans as possible i made mangku pastika , head of the bali investigation it was the first time police suggested formal links between the bali bombers and mr ba 'asyir , who police are detaining and waiting to question over bomb attacks in 2000 .
mr ba 'asyir has denied any terrorist involvement and denies being a leader of a radical muslim group jemaah islamiah , which some governments accuse of being involved in the 12 october bali attack .
police also said the 10 men suspected of carrying out the bali bombing were all indonesians , and that amrozi had told them his real target was american tourists .
' many students ' major-general i made mangku pastika , in charge of the indonesian investigation into the bali attack , said amrozi had taken religious lessons under mr ba 'asyir in the late 1990s .
" abu bakar ba 'asyir is a major preacher who has many students .
one of his students is amrozi , " he said .
mr pastika said amrozi had invited mr ba 'asyir several times to an islamic school in the east javan village of tenggulun , where police detained amrozi last tuesday .
amrozi was arrested last week in east java according to the police , amrozi has already admitted to being the owner of the minivan packed with explosives which blew up outside the bali nightclub in october , and to having been involved in the attack .
mr pastika said amrozi took part in the attack because he wanted to retaliate for us attacks on iraq and afghanistan .
" according to amrozi , he and his group wanted to kill as many americans as possible , " mr pastika said .
" he says america is oppressing islam , " the major-general added .
" according to him america attacked iraq and afghanistan , and america is not fair in the cases of palestine and israel . "
mr pastika said amrozi 's only regret about the bombing was the fact that most of the dead were australians rather than americans .
" he thought many americans were in bali .
when he knew many australians died he was not happy .
he does n't regret it but he is just unhappy , " mr pastika added .
appeal rejected in jakarta on monday , a court rejected an appeal by mr ba 'asyir against his continued detention .
abu bakar ba 'asyir lost his appeal on monday mr ba 'asyir 's legal team argued that the police case against his detention - regarding a series of church bombings in indonesia on christmas eve 2000 - was built entirely on the testimony of one self-confessed member of the al-qaeda network .
but the prosecution argued that the case rested on far more than that .
more arrests indonesian police have arrested two more men in connection with the bali bombing .
officers raided a house in tenggulun early on monday and seized a former forest ranger known as komarudin while he was asleep , according to police sources .
komarudin is thought to have stored weapons and explosives for amrozi .
