poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "

among the many us campaign tactics borrowed by german politicians in this year ’ s election campaign is the use of weekly polls .
but what happens when the polls don ’ t agree ? it was so much simpler in the old days . every four weeks , the country ’ s polling institutes would present the results of their campaign surveys that asked a sample group of germans who they would vote for should federal elections be held the following sunday .
the sunday polls , as they ’ re called , were politely paid attention to , but saved exhaustive analysis . how things have changed .
polls on chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger edmund stoiber ’ s chances have appeared every week in the months leading up to the sept .
22 elections .
the results , commissioned by newspapers and television stations , are quickly broken down and then reassembled again as the basis of the week ’ s news stories . graphics with line charts appear showing a candidate 's rise or fall . the trend is somewhat troubling to hans jürgen weiss , professor at the insitute for media and communication studies at berlin ’ s free university .
the campaign researcher said that the “ exponential ” increase in polling has reduced the quality of the results . “ the quality of the research suffers as a result of competition between the institutes , ” said weiss , in a dw-world interview .
“ the accuracy also suffers . ” everyone 's a winner witness polls taken this week followed germany ’ s media events in the past two weeks : the floods in east germany and the televised debate between schröder and stoiber . analysts predicted schröder and his social democrats would win votes following the chancellor ’ s handling of the flood disaster and his self-assured debate appearance .
polls taken by the forsa institute seemed to confirm their predictions , giving the spd 38 percent – two points more than previous weeks – and bringing them within two points of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union and christian social union bloc . particularly dramatic was the spd ’ s progress in polls following the conclusion of the sunday debates . forsa revealed that schröder scored more points than stoiber in a majority of personal categories , such as sympathy and competence .
other polls by the institutes infratest dimap and forschungs wahlgruppe -lrb- voter group research -rrb- posted similar results . the schröder camp declared victory .
stoiber and the union bloc cried foul . polling institutes ' political ties a day after the poll results were splashed across germany ’ s front pages , the union accused forsa , whose director is a longtime member of the spd , of playing sides . “ forsa is a campaign instrument for the spd , ” said cdu laurenz meyer earlier this week amid union fears the polls would give schröder ’ s a push . he pointed to polls taken by the insitute for public opinion research in allensbach , which showed the spd winning only 32.9 percent of the vote , a one percent increase over the weeks before .
the union remained solid at 40.1 percent . “ the numbers show that the situation for the union on sept .
22 looks good , ” meyer said . like forsa , the whiff of party politics hovers above allensbach , germany 's oldest polling firm , as well .
its 85-year-old founder , elisabeth noelle-neumann , was a longtime political advisor to former cdu chancellor helmut kohl . accusations are " dumb stuff " both polling institutes emphatically deny their results are in any way tainted by the party preference of their leading officials . “ we don ’ t falsify our data , ” said forsa chief manfred güllner , adding meyer ’ s accusation was “ dumb stuff . ”
allensbach says their face-to-face method of research , as opposed to the telephone polls forsa does , is one of the main reasons the institutes offer such different results . weiss also dismisses accusations like meyer ’ s . “ an institute ’ s main business is not political research , but media and marketing research – so they have to work professionally , ” he said . “ my impression is that the the actual numbers don ’ t favor anyone , rather it ’ s the interpretation of those numbers . ” analysts have four more weeks to spend hunched over the weekly polls , predicting either a schröder comeback , or a stoiber march to victory . weiss says the practice will repeat itself with greater frequency in coming elections .

among the many us campaign tactics borrowed by german politicians in this year ’ s election campaign is the use of weekly polls .
but what happens when the polls don ’ t agree ? it was so much simpler in the old days . every four weeks , the country ’ s polling institutes would present the results of their campaign surveys that asked a sample group of germans who they would vote for should federal elections be held the following sunday .
the sunday polls , as they ’ re called , were politely paid attention to , but saved exhaustive analysis . how things have changed .
polls on chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger edmund stoiber ’ s chances have appeared every week in the months leading up to the sept .
22 elections .
the results , commissioned by newspapers and television stations , are quickly broken down and then reassembled again as the basis of the week ’ s news stories . graphics with line charts appear showing a candidate 's rise or fall . the trend is somewhat troubling to hans jürgen weiss , professor at the insitute for media and communication studies at berlin ’ s free university .
the campaign researcher said that the “ exponential ” increase in polling has reduced the quality of the results . “ the quality of the research suffers as a result of competition between the institutes , ” said weiss , in a dw-world interview .
“ the accuracy also suffers . ” everyone 's a winner witness polls taken this week followed germany ’ s media events in the past two weeks : the floods in east germany and the televised debate between schröder and stoiber . analysts predicted schröder and his social democrats would win votes following the chancellor ’ s handling of the flood disaster and his self-assured debate appearance .
polls taken by the forsa institute seemed to confirm their predictions , giving the spd 38 percent – two points more than previous weeks – and bringing them within two points of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union and christian social union bloc . particularly dramatic was the spd ’ s progress in polls following the conclusion of the sunday debates . forsa revealed that schröder scored more points than stoiber in a majority of personal categories , such as sympathy and competence .
other polls by the institutes infratest dimap and forschungs wahlgruppe -lrb- voter group research -rrb- posted similar results . the schröder camp declared victory .
stoiber and the union bloc cried foul . polling institutes ' political ties a day after the poll results were splashed across germany ’ s front pages , the union accused forsa , whose director is a longtime member of the spd , of playing sides . “ forsa is a campaign instrument for the spd , ” said cdu laurenz meyer earlier this week amid union fears the polls would give schröder ’ s a push . he pointed to polls taken by the insitute for public opinion research in allensbach , which showed the spd winning only 32.9 percent of the vote , a one percent increase over the weeks before .
the union remained solid at 40.1 percent . “ the numbers show that the situation for the union on sept .
22 looks good , ” meyer said . like forsa , the whiff of party politics hovers above allensbach , germany 's oldest polling firm , as well .
its 85-year-old founder , elisabeth noelle-neumann , was a longtime political advisor to former cdu chancellor helmut kohl . accusations are " dumb stuff " both polling institutes emphatically deny their results are in any way tainted by the party preference of their leading officials . “ we don ’ t falsify our data , ” said forsa chief manfred güllner , adding meyer ’ s accusation was “ dumb stuff . ”

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "

edmund stoiber 's party is leading most election polls .
as state premier of bavaria for close to ten years , edmund stoiber has steered the state to economic success and the country 's lowest regional unemployment rate . he 's sharp-tongued , sometimes belligerent , but always determined .
and these are all qualities that helped bavarian premier and chancellor candidate edmund stoiber win absolute majorities in the state legislature in two consecutive elections .
but his biggest coup yet is planned for this fall , when stoiber hopes to unseat the social democrats in germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and replace gerhard schröder to become the country 's eighth chancellor .
waiting for the crowning moment on sept .
28 , stoiber turns 61 , but the father of three and grandfather of two is hoping to celebrate six days earlier when germany decides on a new chancellor .
it would be the crowning moment of a political career for a native son of bavaria educated as an attorney but more famous for his work for the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union , beginning in the early 1970s .
after working with the csu 's youth organization , stoiber ran a successful campaign for a seat in the bavarian state legislature in 1974 .
just four years later , he was appointed as the party 's general-secretary .
his tight relationship at the time with then-csu chairman and bavarian premier franz-josef strauss turned professional when strauss appointed him his chief advisor during his unsuccessful run at the chancellor ’ s job in 1980 .
two years later , stoiber became chief of staff in the csu icon ’ s cabinet , an office he held for six years .
after strauss ' death in 1988 , stoiber was appointed bavarian interior minister .
from arch conservative to moderate while holding the office , he drew great attention with his heated rhetoric on the issues of domestic security , legislation relating to foreigners and asylum-seekers , which were among his central political themes .
later , as bavarian premier , stoiber demanded a stricter approach to asylum policies and , at one point , warned against a " multinational society on german ground . "
at times , his image was more akin to a conservative hard-liner than the center-right moderate he is positioning himself as in the current election .
meanwhile , stoiber 's influence within the party continued to increase .
following a series of scandals , bavarian premier max streibl stepped down in may 1993 .
at the time , stoiber beat out csu chairman theo waigel as streibl 's successor .
stoiber then secured absolute majorities in the state legislature for his party during two successive terms .
as a result of the successes , the csu catapulted stoiber to the position of party chairman in january 1999 .
bavaria , inc .
he set himself apart from other politicians for the vigor with which he promoted bavarian industry and the southern state as an investment destination .
the hard work paid off .
bavaria is considered the economic engine of germany , with many high-tech and biotechnology firms calling munich home .
on a national level , stoiber matched his suspicion of a lax immigration policy with a skepticism of brussels as the power of the european union grew .
but despite his criticism of the introduction of the euro , as well as several political scandals and quarrels within bavaria , he still managed to become the key player within the opposition union-bloc parties .
when the parties started contemplating who they would position to challenge gerhard schröder in the 2002 elections , stoiber was among the top candidates on the list .
and after a winter of speculation over who would represent the sister parties in the parliamentary elections , cdu chairwoman angela merkel abandoned her own aspirations for the nation 's highest office , paving the way for edmund stoiber . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

edmund stoiber 's party is leading most election polls .
as state premier of bavaria for close to ten years , edmund stoiber has steered the state to economic success and the country 's lowest regional unemployment rate . he 's sharp-tongued , sometimes belligerent , but always determined .
and these are all qualities that helped bavarian premier and chancellor candidate edmund stoiber win absolute majorities in the state legislature in two consecutive elections .
but his biggest coup yet is planned for this fall , when stoiber hopes to unseat the social democrats in germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and replace gerhard schröder to become the country 's eighth chancellor .
waiting for the crowning moment on sept .
28 , stoiber turns 61 , but the father of three and grandfather of two is hoping to celebrate six days earlier when germany decides on a new chancellor .
it would be the crowning moment of a political career for a native son of bavaria educated as an attorney but more famous for his work for the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union , beginning in the early 1970s .
after working with the csu 's youth organization , stoiber ran a successful campaign for a seat in the bavarian state legislature in 1974 .
just four years later , he was appointed as the party 's general-secretary .
his tight relationship at the time with then-csu chairman and bavarian premier franz-josef strauss turned professional when strauss appointed him his chief advisor during his unsuccessful run at the chancellor ’ s job in 1980 .
two years later , stoiber became chief of staff in the csu icon ’ s cabinet , an office he held for six years .
after strauss ' death in 1988 , stoiber was appointed bavarian interior minister .
from arch conservative to moderate while holding the office , he drew great attention with his heated rhetoric on the issues of domestic security , legislation relating to foreigners and asylum-seekers , which were among his central political themes .
later , as bavarian premier , stoiber demanded a stricter approach to asylum policies and , at one point , warned against a " multinational society on german ground . "
at times , his image was more akin to a conservative hard-liner than the center-right moderate he is positioning himself as in the current election .
meanwhile , stoiber 's influence within the party continued to increase .
following a series of scandals , bavarian premier max streibl stepped down in may 1993 .
at the time , stoiber beat out csu chairman theo waigel as streibl 's successor .
stoiber then secured absolute majorities in the state legislature for his party during two successive terms .
as a result of the successes , the csu catapulted stoiber to the position of party chairman in january 1999 .

the hard work paid off .
bavaria is considered the economic engine of germany , with many high-tech and biotechnology firms calling munich home .
on a national level , stoiber matched his suspicion of a lax immigration policy with a skepticism of brussels as the power of the european union grew .
but despite his criticism of the introduction of the euro , as well as several political scandals and quarrels within bavaria , he still managed to become the key player within the opposition union-bloc parties .
when the parties started contemplating who they would position to challenge gerhard schröder in the 2002 elections , stoiber was among the top candidates on the list .

on a national level , stoiber matched his suspicion of a lax immigration policy with a skepticism of brussels as the power of the european union grew .

when the parties started contemplating who they would position to challenge gerhard schröder in the 2002 elections , stoiber was among the top candidates on the list .

among the many us campaign tactics borrowed by german politicians in this year ’ s election campaign is the use of weekly polls .
but what happens when the polls don ’ t agree ? it was so much simpler in the old days . every four weeks , the country ’ s polling institutes would present the results of their campaign surveys that asked a sample group of germans who they would vote for should federal elections be held the following sunday .

other polls by the institutes infratest dimap and forschungs wahlgruppe -lrb- voter group research -rrb- posted similar results . the schröder camp declared victory .

the union remained solid at 40.1 percent . “ the numbers show that the situation for the union on sept .

among the many us campaign tactics borrowed by german politicians in this year ’ s election campaign is the use of weekly polls .
but what happens when the polls don ’ t agree ? it was so much simpler in the old days . every four weeks , the country ’ s polling institutes would present the results of their campaign surveys that asked a sample group of germans who they would vote for should federal elections be held the following sunday .
the sunday polls , as they ’ re called , were politely paid attention to , but saved exhaustive analysis . how things have changed .
polls on chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger edmund stoiber ’ s chances have appeared every week in the months leading up to the sept .
22 elections .
the results , commissioned by newspapers and television stations , are quickly broken down and then reassembled again as the basis of the week ’ s news stories . graphics with line charts appear showing a candidate 's rise or fall . the trend is somewhat troubling to hans jürgen weiss , professor at the insitute for media and communication studies at berlin ’ s free university .
the campaign researcher said that the “ exponential ” increase in polling has reduced the quality of the results . “ the quality of the research suffers as a result of competition between the institutes , ” said weiss , in a dw-world interview .
“ the accuracy also suffers . ” everyone 's a winner witness polls taken this week followed germany ’ s media events in the past two weeks : the floods in east germany and the televised debate between schröder and stoiber . analysts predicted schröder and his social democrats would win votes following the chancellor ’ s handling of the flood disaster and his self-assured debate appearance .
polls taken by the forsa institute seemed to confirm their predictions , giving the spd 38 percent – two points more than previous weeks – and bringing them within two points of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union and christian social union bloc . particularly dramatic was the spd ’ s progress in polls following the conclusion of the sunday debates . forsa revealed that schröder scored more points than stoiber in a majority of personal categories , such as sympathy and competence .
other polls by the institutes infratest dimap and forschungs wahlgruppe -lrb- voter group research -rrb- posted similar results . the schröder camp declared victory .
stoiber and the union bloc cried foul . polling institutes ' political ties a day after the poll results were splashed across germany ’ s front pages , the union accused forsa , whose director is a longtime member of the spd , of playing sides . “ forsa is a campaign instrument for the spd , ” said cdu laurenz meyer earlier this week amid union fears the polls would give schröder ’ s a push . he pointed to polls taken by the insitute for public opinion research in allensbach , which showed the spd winning only 32.9 percent of the vote , a one percent increase over the weeks before .
the union remained solid at 40.1 percent . “ the numbers show that the situation for the union on sept .
22 looks good , ” meyer said . like forsa , the whiff of party politics hovers above allensbach , germany 's oldest polling firm , as well .
its 85-year-old founder , elisabeth noelle-neumann , was a longtime political advisor to former cdu chancellor helmut kohl . accusations are " dumb stuff " both polling institutes emphatically deny their results are in any way tainted by the party preference of their leading officials . “ we don ’ t falsify our data , ” said forsa chief manfred güllner , adding meyer ’ s accusation was “ dumb stuff . ”
allensbach says their face-to-face method of research , as opposed to the telephone polls forsa does , is one of the main reasons the institutes offer such different results . weiss also dismisses accusations like meyer ’ s . “ an institute ’ s main business is not political research , but media and marketing research – so they have to work professionally , ” he said . “ my impression is that the the actual numbers don ’ t favor anyone , rather it ’ s the interpretation of those numbers . ” analysts have four more weeks to spend hunched over the weekly polls , predicting either a schröder comeback , or a stoiber march to victory . weiss says the practice will repeat itself with greater frequency in coming elections .

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "

among the many us campaign tactics borrowed by german politicians in this year ’ s election campaign is the use of weekly polls .
but what happens when the polls don ’ t agree ? it was so much simpler in the old days . every four weeks , the country ’ s polling institutes would present the results of their campaign surveys that asked a sample group of germans who they would vote for should federal elections be held the following sunday .
the sunday polls , as they ’ re called , were politely paid attention to , but saved exhaustive analysis . how things have changed .
polls on chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger edmund stoiber ’ s chances have appeared every week in the months leading up to the sept .
22 elections .
the results , commissioned by newspapers and television stations , are quickly broken down and then reassembled again as the basis of the week ’ s news stories . graphics with line charts appear showing a candidate 's rise or fall . the trend is somewhat troubling to hans jürgen weiss , professor at the insitute for media and communication studies at berlin ’ s free university .
the campaign researcher said that the “ exponential ” increase in polling has reduced the quality of the results . “ the quality of the research suffers as a result of competition between the institutes , ” said weiss , in a dw-world interview .
“ the accuracy also suffers . ” everyone 's a winner witness polls taken this week followed germany ’ s media events in the past two weeks : the floods in east germany and the televised debate between schröder and stoiber . analysts predicted schröder and his social democrats would win votes following the chancellor ’ s handling of the flood disaster and his self-assured debate appearance .
polls taken by the forsa institute seemed to confirm their predictions , giving the spd 38 percent – two points more than previous weeks – and bringing them within two points of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union and christian social union bloc . particularly dramatic was the spd ’ s progress in polls following the conclusion of the sunday debates . forsa revealed that schröder scored more points than stoiber in a majority of personal categories , such as sympathy and competence .
other polls by the institutes infratest dimap and forschungs wahlgruppe -lrb- voter group research -rrb- posted similar results . the schröder camp declared victory .
stoiber and the union bloc cried foul . polling institutes ' political ties a day after the poll results were splashed across germany ’ s front pages , the union accused forsa , whose director is a longtime member of the spd , of playing sides . “ forsa is a campaign instrument for the spd , ” said cdu laurenz meyer earlier this week amid union fears the polls would give schröder ’ s a push . he pointed to polls taken by the insitute for public opinion research in allensbach , which showed the spd winning only 32.9 percent of the vote , a one percent increase over the weeks before .
the union remained solid at 40.1 percent . “ the numbers show that the situation for the union on sept .
22 looks good , ” meyer said . like forsa , the whiff of party politics hovers above allensbach , germany 's oldest polling firm , as well .
its 85-year-old founder , elisabeth noelle-neumann , was a longtime political advisor to former cdu chancellor helmut kohl . accusations are " dumb stuff " both polling institutes emphatically deny their results are in any way tainted by the party preference of their leading officials . “ we don ’ t falsify our data , ” said forsa chief manfred güllner , adding meyer ’ s accusation was “ dumb stuff . ”
allensbach says their face-to-face method of research , as opposed to the telephone polls forsa does , is one of the main reasons the institutes offer such different results . weiss also dismisses accusations like meyer ’ s . “ an institute ’ s main business is not political research , but media and marketing research – so they have to work professionally , ” he said . “ my impression is that the the actual numbers don ’ t favor anyone , rather it ’ s the interpretation of those numbers . ” analysts have four more weeks to spend hunched over the weekly polls , predicting either a schröder comeback , or a stoiber march to victory . weiss says the practice will repeat itself with greater frequency in coming elections .
it is something he calls the “ professionalization , ” of german campaigning through american political influence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lots of touchés , but no clear winner in german debate chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger , edmund stoiber , both won points .

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .

edmund stoiber 's party is leading most election polls .
as state premier of bavaria for close to ten years , edmund stoiber has steered the state to economic success and the country 's lowest regional unemployment rate . he 's sharp-tongued , sometimes belligerent , but always determined .
and these are all qualities that helped bavarian premier and chancellor candidate edmund stoiber win absolute majorities in the state legislature in two consecutive elections .
but his biggest coup yet is planned for this fall , when stoiber hopes to unseat the social democrats in germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and replace gerhard schröder to become the country 's eighth chancellor .
waiting for the crowning moment on sept .
28 , stoiber turns 61 , but the father of three and grandfather of two is hoping to celebrate six days earlier when germany decides on a new chancellor .
it would be the crowning moment of a political career for a native son of bavaria educated as an attorney but more famous for his work for the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union , beginning in the early 1970s .
after working with the csu 's youth organization , stoiber ran a successful campaign for a seat in the bavarian state legislature in 1974 .
just four years later , he was appointed as the party 's general-secretary .
his tight relationship at the time with then-csu chairman and bavarian premier franz-josef strauss turned professional when strauss appointed him his chief advisor during his unsuccessful run at the chancellor ’ s job in 1980 .
two years later , stoiber became chief of staff in the csu icon ’ s cabinet , an office he held for six years .
after strauss ' death in 1988 , stoiber was appointed bavarian interior minister .
from arch conservative to moderate while holding the office , he drew great attention with his heated rhetoric on the issues of domestic security , legislation relating to foreigners and asylum-seekers , which were among his central political themes .
later , as bavarian premier , stoiber demanded a stricter approach to asylum policies and , at one point , warned against a " multinational society on german ground . "
at times , his image was more akin to a conservative hard-liner than the center-right moderate he is positioning himself as in the current election .
meanwhile , stoiber 's influence within the party continued to increase .
following a series of scandals , bavarian premier max streibl stepped down in may 1993 .
at the time , stoiber beat out csu chairman theo waigel as streibl 's successor .
stoiber then secured absolute majorities in the state legislature for his party during two successive terms .
as a result of the successes , the csu catapulted stoiber to the position of party chairman in january 1999 .

bavaria is considered the economic engine of germany , with many high-tech and biotechnology firms calling munich home .
on a national level , stoiber matched his suspicion of a lax immigration policy with a skepticism of brussels as the power of the european union grew .
but despite his criticism of the introduction of the euro , as well as several political scandals and quarrels within bavaria , he still managed to become the key player within the opposition union-bloc parties .
when the parties started contemplating who they would position to challenge gerhard schröder in the 2002 elections , stoiber was among the top candidates on the list .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .
it simply gives people another choice .
perhaps the best indication of how south africans are laying claim to this new technology is the story of the nicknames people are giving to the units .
" once , we went to the field , and one lady said , look this is a mandela microwave , " says gtz ’ s biermann .
" from that time on , we always say this is our mandela ’ s microwave .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .

among the many us campaign tactics borrowed by german politicians in this year ’ s election campaign is the use of weekly polls .
but what happens when the polls don ’ t agree ? it was so much simpler in the old days . every four weeks , the country ’ s polling institutes would present the results of their campaign surveys that asked a sample group of germans who they would vote for should federal elections be held the following sunday .
the sunday polls , as they ’ re called , were politely paid attention to , but saved exhaustive analysis . how things have changed .
polls on chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger edmund stoiber ’ s chances have appeared every week in the months leading up to the sept .
22 elections .
the results , commissioned by newspapers and television stations , are quickly broken down and then reassembled again as the basis of the week ’ s news stories . graphics with line charts appear showing a candidate 's rise or fall . the trend is somewhat troubling to hans jürgen weiss , professor at the insitute for media and communication studies at berlin ’ s free university .
the campaign researcher said that the “ exponential ” increase in polling has reduced the quality of the results . “ the quality of the research suffers as a result of competition between the institutes , ” said weiss , in a dw-world interview .
“ the accuracy also suffers . ” everyone 's a winner witness polls taken this week followed germany ’ s media events in the past two weeks : the floods in east germany and the televised debate between schröder and stoiber . analysts predicted schröder and his social democrats would win votes following the chancellor ’ s handling of the flood disaster and his self-assured debate appearance .
polls taken by the forsa institute seemed to confirm their predictions , giving the spd 38 percent – two points more than previous weeks – and bringing them within two points of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union and christian social union bloc . particularly dramatic was the spd ’ s progress in polls following the conclusion of the sunday debates . forsa revealed that schröder scored more points than stoiber in a majority of personal categories , such as sympathy and competence .
other polls by the institutes infratest dimap and forschungs wahlgruppe -lrb- voter group research -rrb- posted similar results . the schröder camp declared victory .
stoiber and the union bloc cried foul . polling institutes ' political ties a day after the poll results were splashed across germany ’ s front pages , the union accused forsa , whose director is a longtime member of the spd , of playing sides . “ forsa is a campaign instrument for the spd , ” said cdu laurenz meyer earlier this week amid union fears the polls would give schröder ’ s a push . he pointed to polls taken by the insitute for public opinion research in allensbach , which showed the spd winning only 32.9 percent of the vote , a one percent increase over the weeks before .
the union remained solid at 40.1 percent . “ the numbers show that the situation for the union on sept .
22 looks good , ” meyer said . like forsa , the whiff of party politics hovers above allensbach , germany 's oldest polling firm , as well .
its 85-year-old founder , elisabeth noelle-neumann , was a longtime political advisor to former cdu chancellor helmut kohl . accusations are " dumb stuff " both polling institutes emphatically deny their results are in any way tainted by the party preference of their leading officials . “ we don ’ t falsify our data , ” said forsa chief manfred güllner , adding meyer ’ s accusation was “ dumb stuff . ”
allensbach says their face-to-face method of research , as opposed to the telephone polls forsa does , is one of the main reasons the institutes offer such different results . weiss also dismisses accusations like meyer ’ s . “ an institute ’ s main business is not political research , but media and marketing research – so they have to work professionally , ” he said . “ my impression is that the the actual numbers don ’ t favor anyone , rather it ’ s the interpretation of those numbers . ” analysts have four more weeks to spend hunched over the weekly polls , predicting either a schröder comeback , or a stoiber march to victory . weiss says the practice will repeat itself with greater frequency in coming elections .

polls taken by the forsa institute seemed to confirm their predictions , giving the spd 38 percent – two points more than previous weeks – and bringing them within two points of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union and christian social union bloc . particularly dramatic was the spd ’ s progress in polls following the conclusion of the sunday debates . forsa revealed that schröder scored more points than stoiber in a majority of personal categories , such as sympathy and competence .

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "

edmund stoiber 's party is leading most election polls .
as state premier of bavaria for close to ten years , edmund stoiber has steered the state to economic success and the country 's lowest regional unemployment rate . he 's sharp-tongued , sometimes belligerent , but always determined .
and these are all qualities that helped bavarian premier and chancellor candidate edmund stoiber win absolute majorities in the state legislature in two consecutive elections .
but his biggest coup yet is planned for this fall , when stoiber hopes to unseat the social democrats in germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and replace gerhard schröder to become the country 's eighth chancellor .
waiting for the crowning moment on sept .
28 , stoiber turns 61 , but the father of three and grandfather of two is hoping to celebrate six days earlier when germany decides on a new chancellor .
it would be the crowning moment of a political career for a native son of bavaria educated as an attorney but more famous for his work for the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union , beginning in the early 1970s .
after working with the csu 's youth organization , stoiber ran a successful campaign for a seat in the bavarian state legislature in 1974 .
just four years later , he was appointed as the party 's general-secretary .
his tight relationship at the time with then-csu chairman and bavarian premier franz-josef strauss turned professional when strauss appointed him his chief advisor during his unsuccessful run at the chancellor ’ s job in 1980 .
two years later , stoiber became chief of staff in the csu icon ’ s cabinet , an office he held for six years .
after strauss ' death in 1988 , stoiber was appointed bavarian interior minister .
from arch conservative to moderate while holding the office , he drew great attention with his heated rhetoric on the issues of domestic security , legislation relating to foreigners and asylum-seekers , which were among his central political themes .

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "
now that the democratic republic of congo and rwanda have signed a peace deal designed to end africa 's biggest war , perhaps environmental issues will take on a new significance . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .
it simply gives people another choice .
perhaps the best indication of how south africans are laying claim to this new technology is the story of the nicknames people are giving to the units .
" once , we went to the field , and one lady said , look this is a mandela microwave , " says gtz ’ s biermann .

" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .
it simply gives people another choice .
perhaps the best indication of how south africans are laying claim to this new technology is the story of the nicknames people are giving to the units .
" once , we went to the field , and one lady said , look this is a mandela microwave , " says gtz ’ s biermann .
" from that time on , we always say this is our mandela ’ s microwave .
i hope one day we meet him and we will tell him the story and he will laugh at it .

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .

" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "
now that the democratic republic of congo and rwanda have signed a peace deal designed to end africa 's biggest war , perhaps environmental issues will take on a new significance . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

among the many us campaign tactics borrowed by german politicians in this year ’ s election campaign is the use of weekly polls .
but what happens when the polls don ’ t agree ? it was so much simpler in the old days . every four weeks , the country ’ s polling institutes would present the results of their campaign surveys that asked a sample group of germans who they would vote for should federal elections be held the following sunday .
the sunday polls , as they ’ re called , were politely paid attention to , but saved exhaustive analysis . how things have changed .
polls on chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger edmund stoiber ’ s chances have appeared every week in the months leading up to the sept .
22 elections .
the results , commissioned by newspapers and television stations , are quickly broken down and then reassembled again as the basis of the week ’ s news stories . graphics with line charts appear showing a candidate 's rise or fall . the trend is somewhat troubling to hans jürgen weiss , professor at the insitute for media and communication studies at berlin ’ s free university .
the campaign researcher said that the “ exponential ” increase in polling has reduced the quality of the results . “ the quality of the research suffers as a result of competition between the institutes , ” said weiss , in a dw-world interview .
“ the accuracy also suffers . ” everyone 's a winner witness polls taken this week followed germany ’ s media events in the past two weeks : the floods in east germany and the televised debate between schröder and stoiber . analysts predicted schröder and his social democrats would win votes following the chancellor ’ s handling of the flood disaster and his self-assured debate appearance .
polls taken by the forsa institute seemed to confirm their predictions , giving the spd 38 percent – two points more than previous weeks – and bringing them within two points of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union and christian social union bloc . particularly dramatic was the spd ’ s progress in polls following the conclusion of the sunday debates . forsa revealed that schröder scored more points than stoiber in a majority of personal categories , such as sympathy and competence .
other polls by the institutes infratest dimap and forschungs wahlgruppe -lrb- voter group research -rrb- posted similar results . the schröder camp declared victory .
stoiber and the union bloc cried foul . polling institutes ' political ties a day after the poll results were splashed across germany ’ s front pages , the union accused forsa , whose director is a longtime member of the spd , of playing sides . “ forsa is a campaign instrument for the spd , ” said cdu laurenz meyer earlier this week amid union fears the polls would give schröder ’ s a push . he pointed to polls taken by the insitute for public opinion research in allensbach , which showed the spd winning only 32.9 percent of the vote , a one percent increase over the weeks before .
the union remained solid at 40.1 percent . “ the numbers show that the situation for the union on sept .
22 looks good , ” meyer said . like forsa , the whiff of party politics hovers above allensbach , germany 's oldest polling firm , as well .

edmund stoiber 's party is leading most election polls .

and these are all qualities that helped bavarian premier and chancellor candidate edmund stoiber win absolute majorities in the state legislature in two consecutive elections .
but his biggest coup yet is planned for this fall , when stoiber hopes to unseat the social democrats in germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and replace gerhard schröder to become the country 's eighth chancellor .

it would be the crowning moment of a political career for a native son of bavaria educated as an attorney but more famous for his work for the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union , beginning in the early 1970s .
after working with the csu 's youth organization , stoiber ran a successful campaign for a seat in the bavarian state legislature in 1974 .
just four years later , he was appointed as the party 's general-secretary .
his tight relationship at the time with then-csu chairman and bavarian premier franz-josef strauss turned professional when strauss appointed him his chief advisor during his unsuccessful run at the chancellor ’ s job in 1980 .
two years later , stoiber became chief of staff in the csu icon ’ s cabinet , an office he held for six years .
after strauss ' death in 1988 , stoiber was appointed bavarian interior minister .
from arch conservative to moderate while holding the office , he drew great attention with his heated rhetoric on the issues of domestic security , legislation relating to foreigners and asylum-seekers , which were among his central political themes .

meanwhile , stoiber 's influence within the party continued to increase .
following a series of scandals , bavarian premier max streibl stepped down in may 1993 .
at the time , stoiber beat out csu chairman theo waigel as streibl 's successor .

edmund stoiber 's party is leading most election polls .
as state premier of bavaria for close to ten years , edmund stoiber has steered the state to economic success and the country 's lowest regional unemployment rate . he 's sharp-tongued , sometimes belligerent , but always determined .
and these are all qualities that helped bavarian premier and chancellor candidate edmund stoiber win absolute majorities in the state legislature in two consecutive elections .
but his biggest coup yet is planned for this fall , when stoiber hopes to unseat the social democrats in germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and replace gerhard schröder to become the country 's eighth chancellor .
waiting for the crowning moment on sept .
28 , stoiber turns 61 , but the father of three and grandfather of two is hoping to celebrate six days earlier when germany decides on a new chancellor .
it would be the crowning moment of a political career for a native son of bavaria educated as an attorney but more famous for his work for the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union , beginning in the early 1970s .
after working with the csu 's youth organization , stoiber ran a successful campaign for a seat in the bavarian state legislature in 1974 .
just four years later , he was appointed as the party 's general-secretary .
his tight relationship at the time with then-csu chairman and bavarian premier franz-josef strauss turned professional when strauss appointed him his chief advisor during his unsuccessful run at the chancellor ’ s job in 1980 .
two years later , stoiber became chief of staff in the csu icon ’ s cabinet , an office he held for six years .
after strauss ' death in 1988 , stoiber was appointed bavarian interior minister .
from arch conservative to moderate while holding the office , he drew great attention with his heated rhetoric on the issues of domestic security , legislation relating to foreigners and asylum-seekers , which were among his central political themes .
later , as bavarian premier , stoiber demanded a stricter approach to asylum policies and , at one point , warned against a " multinational society on german ground . "
at times , his image was more akin to a conservative hard-liner than the center-right moderate he is positioning himself as in the current election .
meanwhile , stoiber 's influence within the party continued to increase .
following a series of scandals , bavarian premier max streibl stepped down in may 1993 .
at the time , stoiber beat out csu chairman theo waigel as streibl 's successor .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .
it simply gives people another choice .
perhaps the best indication of how south africans are laying claim to this new technology is the story of the nicknames people are giving to the units .
" once , we went to the field , and one lady said , look this is a mandela microwave , " says gtz ’ s biermann .
" from that time on , we always say this is our mandela ’ s microwave .
i hope one day we meet him and we will tell him the story and he will laugh at it .

biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .

richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .

the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .

motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .

but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "

hand in glove with corrupt business people , they are trapping whole nations in poverty and hampering sustainable development . ” three steps forwards , two steps back according to transparency international there were a few positive signs in the former communist countries but most nations of the former soviet union were still riddled with corruption .
the situation was similar in the world 's developing countries - latin america as a whole has slipped down considerably in the rankings of perceived public corruption . there is little to crow about among the developed nations , too .
finland retained its place at the top of the table , followed by denmark , new zealand , iceland , singapore and sweden .
but italy , in 31st place , and greece , down at number 44 , are now behind ex-communist slovenia , and ireland 's rating has also slipped from 7.5 to 6.9 . speaking in malaysia on the launch of cpi 2002 , ti vice-chairman tunku abdul aziz said , “ the cpi has once again confirmed that corruption is a malady afflicting not only the developing countries , but also the developed world . ” in germany , which ranked 18 in the 102 countries on the list , ti founder peter eigen warned that the country 's international reputaion could be seriously damaged if it did not fight corrruption .
" one must fear that botswana -lrb- ranking 24 -rrb- may one day overtake germany " , he said . cpi not the whole picture the cpi is collated from a number of independent surveys by non-governmental organisations , country analysts and business .
a country is only taken into the cpi if it features three or more surveys .
“ it is important to emphasise that the cpi , even with 102 countries , is only a snapshot , ” said eigen .
“ there is not sufficient data on other countries , many of which are likely to be corrupt . ” talking about the un summit in johannesburg , eigen stressed that it “ must lead to action .

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "

hand in glove with corrupt business people , they are trapping whole nations in poverty and hampering sustainable development . ” three steps forwards , two steps back according to transparency international there were a few positive signs in the former communist countries but most nations of the former soviet union were still riddled with corruption .
the situation was similar in the world 's developing countries - latin america as a whole has slipped down considerably in the rankings of perceived public corruption . there is little to crow about among the developed nations , too .
finland retained its place at the top of the table , followed by denmark , new zealand , iceland , singapore and sweden .
but italy , in 31st place , and greece , down at number 44 , are now behind ex-communist slovenia , and ireland 's rating has also slipped from 7.5 to 6.9 . speaking in malaysia on the launch of cpi 2002 , ti vice-chairman tunku abdul aziz said , “ the cpi has once again confirmed that corruption is a malady afflicting not only the developing countries , but also the developed world . ” in germany , which ranked 18 in the 102 countries on the list , ti founder peter eigen warned that the country 's international reputaion could be seriously damaged if it did not fight corrruption .
" one must fear that botswana -lrb- ranking 24 -rrb- may one day overtake germany " , he said . cpi not the whole picture the cpi is collated from a number of independent surveys by non-governmental organisations , country analysts and business .
a country is only taken into the cpi if it features three or more surveys .
“ it is important to emphasise that the cpi , even with 102 countries , is only a snapshot , ” said eigen .
“ there is not sufficient data on other countries , many of which are likely to be corrupt . ” talking about the un summit in johannesburg , eigen stressed that it “ must lead to action .
corruption impedes sustainable growth and robs the children of today of the resources they will need to survive tomorrow . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .

among the many us campaign tactics borrowed by german politicians in this year ’ s election campaign is the use of weekly polls .
but what happens when the polls don ’ t agree ? it was so much simpler in the old days . every four weeks , the country ’ s polling institutes would present the results of their campaign surveys that asked a sample group of germans who they would vote for should federal elections be held the following sunday .
the sunday polls , as they ’ re called , were politely paid attention to , but saved exhaustive analysis . how things have changed .
polls on chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger edmund stoiber ’ s chances have appeared every week in the months leading up to the sept .
22 elections .
the results , commissioned by newspapers and television stations , are quickly broken down and then reassembled again as the basis of the week ’ s news stories . graphics with line charts appear showing a candidate 's rise or fall . the trend is somewhat troubling to hans jürgen weiss , professor at the insitute for media and communication studies at berlin ’ s free university .
the campaign researcher said that the “ exponential ” increase in polling has reduced the quality of the results . “ the quality of the research suffers as a result of competition between the institutes , ” said weiss , in a dw-world interview .
“ the accuracy also suffers . ” everyone 's a winner witness polls taken this week followed germany ’ s media events in the past two weeks : the floods in east germany and the televised debate between schröder and stoiber . analysts predicted schröder and his social democrats would win votes following the chancellor ’ s handling of the flood disaster and his self-assured debate appearance .
polls taken by the forsa institute seemed to confirm their predictions , giving the spd 38 percent – two points more than previous weeks – and bringing them within two points of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union and christian social union bloc . particularly dramatic was the spd ’ s progress in polls following the conclusion of the sunday debates . forsa revealed that schröder scored more points than stoiber in a majority of personal categories , such as sympathy and competence .
other polls by the institutes infratest dimap and forschungs wahlgruppe -lrb- voter group research -rrb- posted similar results . the schröder camp declared victory .
stoiber and the union bloc cried foul . polling institutes ' political ties a day after the poll results were splashed across germany ’ s front pages , the union accused forsa , whose director is a longtime member of the spd , of playing sides . “ forsa is a campaign instrument for the spd , ” said cdu laurenz meyer earlier this week amid union fears the polls would give schröder ’ s a push . he pointed to polls taken by the insitute for public opinion research in allensbach , which showed the spd winning only 32.9 percent of the vote , a one percent increase over the weeks before .
the union remained solid at 40.1 percent . “ the numbers show that the situation for the union on sept .

allensbach says their face-to-face method of research , as opposed to the telephone polls forsa does , is one of the main reasons the institutes offer such different results . weiss also dismisses accusations like meyer ’ s . “ an institute ’ s main business is not political research , but media and marketing research – so they have to work professionally , ” he said . “ my impression is that the the actual numbers don ’ t favor anyone , rather it ’ s the interpretation of those numbers . ” analysts have four more weeks to spend hunched over the weekly polls , predicting either a schröder comeback , or a stoiber march to victory . weiss says the practice will repeat itself with greater frequency in coming elections .

hand in glove with corrupt business people , they are trapping whole nations in poverty and hampering sustainable development . ” three steps forwards , two steps back according to transparency international there were a few positive signs in the former communist countries but most nations of the former soviet union were still riddled with corruption .
the situation was similar in the world 's developing countries - latin america as a whole has slipped down considerably in the rankings of perceived public corruption . there is little to crow about among the developed nations , too .
finland retained its place at the top of the table , followed by denmark , new zealand , iceland , singapore and sweden .
but italy , in 31st place , and greece , down at number 44 , are now behind ex-communist slovenia , and ireland 's rating has also slipped from 7.5 to 6.9 . speaking in malaysia on the launch of cpi 2002 , ti vice-chairman tunku abdul aziz said , “ the cpi has once again confirmed that corruption is a malady afflicting not only the developing countries , but also the developed world . ” in germany , which ranked 18 in the 102 countries on the list , ti founder peter eigen warned that the country 's international reputaion could be seriously damaged if it did not fight corrruption .
" one must fear that botswana -lrb- ranking 24 -rrb- may one day overtake germany " , he said . cpi not the whole picture the cpi is collated from a number of independent surveys by non-governmental organisations , country analysts and business .
a country is only taken into the cpi if it features three or more surveys .
“ it is important to emphasise that the cpi , even with 102 countries , is only a snapshot , ” said eigen .
“ there is not sufficient data on other countries , many of which are likely to be corrupt . ” talking about the un summit in johannesburg , eigen stressed that it “ must lead to action .
corruption impedes sustainable growth and robs the children of today of the resources they will need to survive tomorrow . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "

among the many us campaign tactics borrowed by german politicians in this year ’ s election campaign is the use of weekly polls .
but what happens when the polls don ’ t agree ? it was so much simpler in the old days . every four weeks , the country ’ s polling institutes would present the results of their campaign surveys that asked a sample group of germans who they would vote for should federal elections be held the following sunday .
the sunday polls , as they ’ re called , were politely paid attention to , but saved exhaustive analysis . how things have changed .
polls on chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger edmund stoiber ’ s chances have appeared every week in the months leading up to the sept .
22 elections .
the results , commissioned by newspapers and television stations , are quickly broken down and then reassembled again as the basis of the week ’ s news stories . graphics with line charts appear showing a candidate 's rise or fall . the trend is somewhat troubling to hans jürgen weiss , professor at the insitute for media and communication studies at berlin ’ s free university .
the campaign researcher said that the “ exponential ” increase in polling has reduced the quality of the results . “ the quality of the research suffers as a result of competition between the institutes , ” said weiss , in a dw-world interview .
“ the accuracy also suffers . ” everyone 's a winner witness polls taken this week followed germany ’ s media events in the past two weeks : the floods in east germany and the televised debate between schröder and stoiber . analysts predicted schröder and his social democrats would win votes following the chancellor ’ s handling of the flood disaster and his self-assured debate appearance .
polls taken by the forsa institute seemed to confirm their predictions , giving the spd 38 percent – two points more than previous weeks – and bringing them within two points of stoiber ’ s christian democratic union and christian social union bloc . particularly dramatic was the spd ’ s progress in polls following the conclusion of the sunday debates . forsa revealed that schröder scored more points than stoiber in a majority of personal categories , such as sympathy and competence .
other polls by the institutes infratest dimap and forschungs wahlgruppe -lrb- voter group research -rrb- posted similar results . the schröder camp declared victory .

the union remained solid at 40.1 percent . “ the numbers show that the situation for the union on sept .

among the many us campaign tactics borrowed by german politicians in this year ’ s election campaign is the use of weekly polls .

the results , commissioned by newspapers and television stations , are quickly broken down and then reassembled again as the basis of the week ’ s news stories . graphics with line charts appear showing a candidate 's rise or fall . the trend is somewhat troubling to hans jürgen weiss , professor at the insitute for media and communication studies at berlin ’ s free university .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .
it simply gives people another choice .
perhaps the best indication of how south africans are laying claim to this new technology is the story of the nicknames people are giving to the units .
" once , we went to the field , and one lady said , look this is a mandela microwave , " says gtz ’ s biermann .
" from that time on , we always say this is our mandela ’ s microwave .
i hope one day we meet him and we will tell him the story and he will laugh at it .

hand in glove with corrupt business people , they are trapping whole nations in poverty and hampering sustainable development . ” three steps forwards , two steps back according to transparency international there were a few positive signs in the former communist countries but most nations of the former soviet union were still riddled with corruption .
the situation was similar in the world 's developing countries - latin america as a whole has slipped down considerably in the rankings of perceived public corruption . there is little to crow about among the developed nations , too .
finland retained its place at the top of the table , followed by denmark , new zealand , iceland , singapore and sweden .
but italy , in 31st place , and greece , down at number 44 , are now behind ex-communist slovenia , and ireland 's rating has also slipped from 7.5 to 6.9 . speaking in malaysia on the launch of cpi 2002 , ti vice-chairman tunku abdul aziz said , “ the cpi has once again confirmed that corruption is a malady afflicting not only the developing countries , but also the developed world . ” in germany , which ranked 18 in the 102 countries on the list , ti founder peter eigen warned that the country 's international reputaion could be seriously damaged if it did not fight corrruption .
" one must fear that botswana -lrb- ranking 24 -rrb- may one day overtake germany " , he said . cpi not the whole picture the cpi is collated from a number of independent surveys by non-governmental organisations , country analysts and business .
a country is only taken into the cpi if it features three or more surveys .
“ it is important to emphasise that the cpi , even with 102 countries , is only a snapshot , ” said eigen .
“ there is not sufficient data on other countries , many of which are likely to be corrupt . ” talking about the un summit in johannesburg , eigen stressed that it “ must lead to action .
corruption impedes sustainable growth and robs the children of today of the resources they will need to survive tomorrow . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "

poaching and civil war have threatened the rare eastern lowland gorilla in the democratic republic of congo .
but germany 's gtz is trying to protect the few animals remaining – and also help the people of the region . zaire ’ s gorillas were catapulted to international fame by the movie " gorillas in the mist " , dedicated to the late american zoologist diane fossey .
the kahuzi-biega national park in the east of the democratic republic of congo , the former zaire , is home to the rare eastern lowland gorilla .
with a height of up to 180 cm and weight of 200 kg , gorilla gorilla graueri is one of the most impressive of the gorilla family .
but through poaching and civil war , the population has shrunk to not more than a couple of hundred animals .
germany 's society for technical co-operation , the gtz , wants to ensure that these specimens can survive .
its work isn ’ t easy , though .
carlos schuler , the local gtz project manager , says traps continue to be a major threat to the gorillas and other animals in the park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a park ranger demonstrating a trap used by poachers .
according to schuler , the most harmful traps are the big iron ones with teeth -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if an animal gets caught in one of these , it has little chance to get out alive , " he told dw-radio ’ s ludger schadomsky .
" we even had small elephants getting trapped inside .
a gorilla would lose its leg or hand , and in most cases , it would die from an infection . "
the losses in the gorilla population aren ’ t quite as dramatic as those of elephants .
still , there are some primate skulls on exhibition at park headquarters .
among them is mushamuka , who was featured in " gorillas in the mist " , and maheshe , who achieved fame nationwide after being featured on the 50 000 zaire currency note in former president mobutu sese seko ’ s time .
the bank note was even called maheshe by zaireans .
a " natural compass " thanks to support rendered by the gtz and the ted turner foundation , kahuzi ’ s game wardens are a far cry from congo ’ s ragged army .
they sport polished boots and clean shirts , embroided with the national park logo , the okapi , an elusive animal endemic to congo ’ s rain forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ludger schadomsky talking to a park ranger .
what is also unusual about the park staff is that there are several pygmy wardens .
pygmies , traditionally hunters and gatherers , know their way around the forest better than any of the bantu tribes who constitute the majority of congolese .
but it is only now that the knowledge of the original inhabitants of central africa ’ s forests is being recognized – and employed as trackers .
a " natural compass " is what carlos schuler calls the pygmies .
but despite the new status afforded to congo ’ s pygmies , alcohol remains a problem , and so does schooling .
very few pygmies are able to send their children to school .
fees are a mere $ 1 per term – beyond the reach of most .
yet only education will allow the pygmies to escape the vicious cycle of poverty .
this is where the gtz steps in .
at the rabeka primary school , just outside the park , the german organization covers the fees for pygmie children to attend .
it also helps maintain the school buildings .
wooden gorillas to raise awareness chief warden john spent four years habituating with the gorillas and can communicate with them .
with support from the japanese government , he has established his own gorilla ngo , " pole pole " , which means " slowly , slowly " in the local swahili language .
" we have many different projects , but the main one is the wood craving , " john explains .
" as a park employee , i decided to take these jobless people , the former poachers , to do something , because they are talented . "
so , he trained them how to carve wood .
the figures are not geared for the domestic market , though .
there aren ’ t many congolese who can afford to pay up to $ 15 for a wooden gorilla .
john thus sells his gorilla souvenirs abroad .
participants in the program appreciate john and his colleagues ’ efforts to save the animals in the park .
" it has taken them a long time to realize the potential , " says one man .
" now , people are ready to protect the animals and the environment . "
winning the hearts and minds of the local people for animal protection is indeed a slow process .
but , a start has been made .
tourists are beginning to come back .
they each pay $ 200 for the visit , money that is used for training and awareness programs .
if carlos is right , it ’ s not only good for congo ’ s gorillas .
ultimately , it ’ s the people of congo who stand to benefit .
in light of all the country ’ s suffering , it may be questionable if animal protection is justified in the face of congo ’ s human tragedy .
gtz ’ s carlos schuler is adamant it is .
" this is about the people , " he says .
" if the people are alright , then so are the animals . "

hand in glove with corrupt business people , they are trapping whole nations in poverty and hampering sustainable development . ” three steps forwards , two steps back according to transparency international there were a few positive signs in the former communist countries but most nations of the former soviet union were still riddled with corruption .
the situation was similar in the world 's developing countries - latin america as a whole has slipped down considerably in the rankings of perceived public corruption . there is little to crow about among the developed nations , too .
finland retained its place at the top of the table , followed by denmark , new zealand , iceland , singapore and sweden .
but italy , in 31st place , and greece , down at number 44 , are now behind ex-communist slovenia , and ireland 's rating has also slipped from 7.5 to 6.9 . speaking in malaysia on the launch of cpi 2002 , ti vice-chairman tunku abdul aziz said , “ the cpi has once again confirmed that corruption is a malady afflicting not only the developing countries , but also the developed world . ” in germany , which ranked 18 in the 102 countries on the list , ti founder peter eigen warned that the country 's international reputaion could be seriously damaged if it did not fight corrruption .
" one must fear that botswana -lrb- ranking 24 -rrb- may one day overtake germany " , he said . cpi not the whole picture the cpi is collated from a number of independent surveys by non-governmental organisations , country analysts and business .
a country is only taken into the cpi if it features three or more surveys .
“ it is important to emphasise that the cpi , even with 102 countries , is only a snapshot , ” said eigen .

hand in glove with corrupt business people , they are trapping whole nations in poverty and hampering sustainable development . ” three steps forwards , two steps back according to transparency international there were a few positive signs in the former communist countries but most nations of the former soviet union were still riddled with corruption .
the situation was similar in the world 's developing countries - latin america as a whole has slipped down considerably in the rankings of perceived public corruption . there is little to crow about among the developed nations , too .
finland retained its place at the top of the table , followed by denmark , new zealand , iceland , singapore and sweden .
but italy , in 31st place , and greece , down at number 44 , are now behind ex-communist slovenia , and ireland 's rating has also slipped from 7.5 to 6.9 . speaking in malaysia on the launch of cpi 2002 , ti vice-chairman tunku abdul aziz said , “ the cpi has once again confirmed that corruption is a malady afflicting not only the developing countries , but also the developed world . ” in germany , which ranked 18 in the 102 countries on the list , ti founder peter eigen warned that the country 's international reputaion could be seriously damaged if it did not fight corrruption .
" one must fear that botswana -lrb- ranking 24 -rrb- may one day overtake germany " , he said . cpi not the whole picture the cpi is collated from a number of independent surveys by non-governmental organisations , country analysts and business .
a country is only taken into the cpi if it features three or more surveys .
“ it is important to emphasise that the cpi , even with 102 countries , is only a snapshot , ” said eigen .
“ there is not sufficient data on other countries , many of which are likely to be corrupt . ” talking about the un summit in johannesburg , eigen stressed that it “ must lead to action .

hand in glove with corrupt business people , they are trapping whole nations in poverty and hampering sustainable development . ” three steps forwards , two steps back according to transparency international there were a few positive signs in the former communist countries but most nations of the former soviet union were still riddled with corruption .
the situation was similar in the world 's developing countries - latin america as a whole has slipped down considerably in the rankings of perceived public corruption . there is little to crow about among the developed nations , too .
finland retained its place at the top of the table , followed by denmark , new zealand , iceland , singapore and sweden .
but italy , in 31st place , and greece , down at number 44 , are now behind ex-communist slovenia , and ireland 's rating has also slipped from 7.5 to 6.9 . speaking in malaysia on the launch of cpi 2002 , ti vice-chairman tunku abdul aziz said , “ the cpi has once again confirmed that corruption is a malady afflicting not only the developing countries , but also the developed world . ” in germany , which ranked 18 in the 102 countries on the list , ti founder peter eigen warned that the country 's international reputaion could be seriously damaged if it did not fight corrruption .
" one must fear that botswana -lrb- ranking 24 -rrb- may one day overtake germany " , he said . cpi not the whole picture the cpi is collated from a number of independent surveys by non-governmental organisations , country analysts and business .
a country is only taken into the cpi if it features three or more surveys .
“ it is important to emphasise that the cpi , even with 102 countries , is only a snapshot , ” said eigen .
“ there is not sufficient data on other countries , many of which are likely to be corrupt . ” talking about the un summit in johannesburg , eigen stressed that it “ must lead to action .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .
it simply gives people another choice .
perhaps the best indication of how south africans are laying claim to this new technology is the story of the nicknames people are giving to the units .
" once , we went to the field , and one lady said , look this is a mandela microwave , " says gtz ’ s biermann .
" from that time on , we always say this is our mandela ’ s microwave .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .
it simply gives people another choice .
perhaps the best indication of how south africans are laying claim to this new technology is the story of the nicknames people are giving to the units .
" once , we went to the field , and one lady said , look this is a mandela microwave , " says gtz ’ s biermann .
" from that time on , we always say this is our mandela ’ s microwave .

thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .
it simply gives people another choice .
perhaps the best indication of how south africans are laying claim to this new technology is the story of the nicknames people are giving to the units .
" once , we went to the field , and one lady said , look this is a mandela microwave , " says gtz ’ s biermann .
" from that time on , we always say this is our mandela ’ s microwave .
i hope one day we meet him and we will tell him the story and he will laugh at it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the path to a sustainable future helping gorillas survive keeping cool in india dw-radio -pipe- 29.08.2002 nelson mandela ’ s microwave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chicken stew tastes better with a touch of sunshine .
thanks to support by germany ’ s development agency gtz , many households in south africa are turning to the sun to prepare their food . in all developing countries , the traditional source of energy for cooking is firewood .
but in many regions , and particularly in the dry areas of africa , firewood is becoming increasingly rare .
people often need to travel long distances to find fuel .
trees and bushes are being cut down , putting increasing pressure on the environment .
but there is a cost-effective and highly efficient solution to the problem , at least for people living in parts of the world where there is intense sunshine : solar cookers .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation gtz is helping to promote such cookers in south africa .
they are helping the poor save time and money – and using the clean renewable energy of the sun also helps save the environment .
a stove in the sun in the hududi township , near vryburg in south africa ’ s northwest province , anna motsewabona opens a device that looks like a heavily-loaded suitcase .
but , it ’ s actually an instrument to cook her food .
" i simply put it out to face the sun .
then , i have to keep tasting the food to see if it ’ s cooked or not , " she says .
motsewabona is one of a growing number of women who have changed to the new technology of solar cookers .
not only that , her new " stove " helps her save time .
" i ’ m able to do my washing while the pots are cooking . "
for most of her 70 years of life , motswewabona cooked with wood , coal or paraffin .
she now has electricity in her house .
but even though electrification has improved people ’ s lives , many still find the costs of using it too high .
a change of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar lunch many families have turned to solar cookers as a cheaper solution .
the partnership behind this initiative involves germany ’ s gtz and the south african department of minerals and energy .
gtz project manager eberhard biermann says they ’ ve had to overcome some mental blocks with regards to the idea of cooking with sunlight .
in vryburg , the society invited local housewives to talk about this .
" we discussed the matter , if the sun is shining what is it doing for the family , " biermann told dw-radio ’ s shepi mati .
" it can dry the washing , the sun can dry fruits , it can dry your body if you were in the water and all that . "
but cooking with the sun did not cross the womens ’ minds .
and , when biermann asked if they could imagine it , they all laughed at him .
the process of winning acceptance for a new technology requires patience .
biermann says the most critical point is when people see how solar cookers can change their day-to-day lives .
" only if they burned their fingers , if they saw the bubbles coming out of the pot when the soup was cooking .
only then did they slowly start to understand and believe , " he says .
" that is the process .
you can not force it , you must support it in the form of demonstrations and cook-ins . "
an alternative choice seven types of solar stoves have been introduced in south africa .
with more than 800 sold so far , four models are clearly the most popular .
richard palmer , the managing director of palmer development consulting , has conducted field testing of the cookers .
he says one of the most popular brands is the t16 .
" this cooker would take cooking oil to about 185 degrees and you ’ d cook a meal for a family of six within an hour , " palmer says .
the components for the t16 stove are made in germany .
the panels are laser cut and folded .
but the stove is actually made locally .
the south african assembly plant is a company called lightweight technologies in pretoria .
one of the retailers of the solar stoves is pretoria-based sunelectricity .
richard maleka is the technical manager and has been selling solar cookers for more than five years .
he is enthusiastic about the range of models he has on sale .
" the most popular one is the t-16 , with its size and its compatibility , " maleka says .
" it ’ s easy to just put in the boot of a car .
and it ’ s not only for the rural people .
i ’ m also a user of a t16 in my house . "
the solar cooker has come to stay in the kitchens of vryburg .
it has not come to replace the electric stove , or paraffin heater .
it simply gives people another choice .
perhaps the best indication of how south africans are laying claim to this new technology is the story of the nicknames people are giving to the units .
" once , we went to the field , and one lady said , look this is a mandela microwave , " says gtz ’ s biermann .
" from that time on , we always say this is our mandela ’ s microwave .
i hope one day we meet him and we will tell him the story and he will laugh at it .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- breakfast -pipe- four month shut-down on britain 's busiest rail line news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : programmes : breakfast news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk thursday , 29 august , 2002 , 05:13 gmt 06:13 uk four month shut-down on britain 's busiest rail line the west coast main line " will close " for its upgrade it 's expected to be announced by the strategic rail authority on thursday morning that part of britain 's busiest section railway line will close for four months next summer .
a 40 mile stretch of the west coast mainline near stoke will shut in an attempt to cut costs and speed up track improvements .
kevin bocquet reported live from cheadle hume station for breakfast and confirmed that the line would be closing click here to see kevin bocquet 's report major disruption over a limited period it 's been confirmed this morning that a 40 mile stretch will close for four months next summer , then for another four months in 2004 and that 's for upgrading to the west coast line .
the thinking behind this is that it 's better to cause major disruption over a limited period rather than intermittent closures over a longer period of time .
it 's unclear what passengers will do , there are other routes but these are smaller lines carrying local traffic - everything would move very slowly .
it could mean people will be put on to buses - the big companies like virgin will fear that some of their customers will think there is no point persevering and find other means of getting around .
the times newspaper said the programme would see the line closed for 17 weeks from colwich in staffordshire to cheadle hulme , just south of stockport , next summer .
this will be followed by a second 17-week closure early in 2004 , from crewe to cheadle hulme .
this will force hundreds of thousands of passengers to take long diversions or switch to buses . ' £ 4bn saved ' the closure is aimed at speeding up the upgrade which should allow virgin 's tilting trains to run on the line at speeds of up to 125mph by the end of 2004 .
the cost of the modernisation of the main route between london and glasgow has become enormous - and it is way behind schedule .
west cost main line upgrade originally estimated at £ 2.1bn costs have reached £ 10-13bn closures could save £ 4bn the line is already being closed every weekend for 18 weeks for a 25-mile stretch between milton keynes and hemel hempstead .
the cost of the project is now put at up to £ 13 billion , compared with railtrack 's original estimate four years ago of £ 2.1 billion .
a second phase intended to deliver trains running at 140mph has been shelved indefinitely .
richard bowker , the sra chairman , has decided passengers will be better served in the long term by a limited period of major disruption , rather than spreading the impact over several years , according to the times .
the sra believes the line closures will cut about £ 4 billion from the final bill , bringing the total budget " south of £ 10 billion , " the newspaper reported .
practice service taxpayers are expected to have to pick up much of the bill for railtrack 's failure to keep control of the project .
the huge cost over-runs were one of the main reasons for the government forcing the company into administration last october .
since then , the sra has also been forced to pay virgin more than £ 100m from the public purse , to compensate for the delayed introduction of its new high-speed tilting trains .

economic output was 4.5 % higher in the april to june period than a year before , the country 's national economic development authority said .
and it was 2.3 % higher than in the three months before , representing the best quarterly growth rate since 1997 .
" the philippine economy turned in a pleasant surprise by growing at a rate that exceeded even neda projections , " socio-economic planning secretary dante canlas said .
export boost the rise , which compared with official forecasts of 3.9 % growth , was credited largely to a strong performance by philippine industry .
industrial output , buoyed by strong exports , grew by 4.3 % year-on-year , compared with a rate of 1.3 % recorded in the january to march quarter .
the performance helped offset a decline to 2.4 % in agricultural growth , from 4.6 % the quarter before .
service sector output edged up half a percentage point to 5.5 % .
regional champion friday 's data placed the philippines among asia 's best performing countries .
the economies of malaysia , singapore and taiwan all expanded about 4 % over ht period , with indonesia posting 3.5 % growth .
but analysts questioned whether the philippine economy could maintain its growth rate , and the data failed to cheer investors , with the main manila stock market index closing up only 0.2 % on thursday .
economists are particularly concerned about the impact of the slower than expected recovery in the us , the philippines ' biggest trading partner , and the recurrence of the el nino weather pattern .
" we do not think the economy can sustain this pace of growth , " said song seng wun , an economist with gk goh securities in singapore .
it is feared that el nino could bring a drought in the last three months of the year .
the government , however , has maintained a prediction of growth hitting 4.0-4.5 % for the full year .

health authorities have been told by health minister jane hutt that they must be operating schemes to cope with disruptive members of the public by march 2003 .
a violent patient can cause immense stress among doctors and their staff dr andrew dearden , bma the move follows pressure on ms hutt from the british medical association 's welsh gp committee .
she had already told health chiefs that plans setting out moves to safeguard workers had to be prepared by october .
the latest move reinforces her determination to see staff operating in a danger-free environment .
doctors and other primary care staff at some surgeries have been physically assaulted or faced threats and verbal abuse .
blacklisted statistics revealed that one in four gps had been abused , intimidated , threatened , or physically injured during their work .
in some areas , blacklisted patients struck off gps ' lists for bad behaviour have been treated in police stations .
during the past 18 months , those banned from surgeries in south wales have been treated by gps who have been retained specifically to provide services to them .
they have been seen at " alternative treatment centres " in cardiff , swansea , barry , and pontypridd .
the gp committee has welcomed the move , saying doctors were delighted with ms hutt 's reaaction to their calls for help .
' immense stress ' committee chairman dr andrew dearden said : " we met the minister last week and told her that doctors in wales were no longer prepared to face intimidation and violence while carrying out their normal , daily work .
" an aggressive patient who is swearing and threatening staff in the reception area can severely frighten vulnerable patients like the elderly or the very young .
" there are too many examples right across wales of doctors being assaulted .
" for example , being pinned up against the wall in their own surgery , criminal damage to waiting rooms , and death threats , some involving weapons , made against practice staff . "

washington 's top arms control negotiator , john bolton , made the accusation during a speech in the south korean capital , seoul .
too frequently , north korea acts as if the world will keep looking the other way john bolton , us undersecretary of state he said north korea was also at the forefront of peddling ballistic missile components and technical expertise .
last week the white house was reported to be imposing sanctions on a north korean company for selling missile parts to yemen , although the sanctions are largely symbolic as there is no trade relationship between the us and pyongyang .
the bbc 's caroline gluck in seoul says that while there was little new in mr bolton 's speech , it came at a sensitive time .
north korean officials are currently in the south for economic co-operation talks and the north has made several recent gestures aimed at ending its diplomatic isolation .
our correspondent says south korean officials will be worried by the timing of the speech .
attempts to push forward reconciliation with the north have been hit by president bush 's hard-line policy towards pyongyang .
mr bolton , undersecretary of state , is in south korea for talks with foreign ministry and defence officials about north korea 's missile programme .
he said us president george bush was factually correct to brand the north korean regime as part of an " axis of evil " along with iran and iraq .
bolton : " we see few signs of change " their leaders , he said continued to starve their people , and there was an axis between the regimes , along which flowed dangerous weapons and technology .
" i must say personally that this administration has repeatedly put the north on notice that it must get out of the business of proliferation , " mr bolton told south korean government officials , academics and businessmen .
" nonetheless , we see few , if any , signs of change on this front .
" too frequently , north korea acts as if the world will keep looking the other way . "
changes ' needed ' but mr bolton acknowledged there had been hopeful signs of potential change in pyongyang , including attempts to improve its diplomatic relations with south korea and japan , and reports of economic changes .
mr bolton said the us was prepared to talk to the regime and take steps with its allies to help the country transform itself .
but he said the responsibility lay with pyongyang .

" if north korea wants to have a brighter future , it needs to fundamentally shift the way it operates at home and abroad . "
mr bolton also warned that a 1994 power deal under which pyongyang agreed to freeze its suspected nuclear programme in exchange for two light water reactors could be further delayed if the north did not allow in nuclear inspectors .
asked why he had chosen to make his comments at such a sensitive time , mr bolton told reporters he was simply " having a little straight talk among friends " .

washington 's top arms control negotiator , john bolton , made the accusation during a speech in the south korean capital , seoul . "
too frequently , north korea acts as if the world will keep looking the other way " john bolton , us undersecretary of state he said north korea was also at the forefront of peddling ballistic missile components and technical expertise .
last week the white house was reported to be imposing sanctions on a north korean company for selling missile parts to yemen , although the sanctions are largely symbolic as there is no trade relationship between the us and pyongyang .
the bbc 's caroline gluck in seoul says that while there was little new in mr bolton 's speech , it came at a sensitive time .
north korean officials are currently in the south for economic co-operation talks and the north has made several recent gestures aimed at ending its diplomatic isolation .
our correspondent says south korean officials will be worried by the timing of the speech .
attempts to push forward reconciliation with the north have been hit by president bush 's hard-line policy towards pyongyang .
mr bolton , undersecretary of state , is in south korea for talks with foreign ministry and defence officials about north korea 's missile programme .
he said us president george bush was factually correct to brand the north korean regime as part of an " axis of evil " along with iran and iraq .
their leaders , he said continued to starve their people , and there was an axis between the regimes , along which flowed dangerous weapons and technology .
" i must say personally that this administration has repeatedly put the north on notice that it must get out of the business of proliferation , " mr bolton told south korean government officials , academics and businessmen .
" nonetheless , we see few , if any , signs of change on this front .
" too frequently , north korea acts as if the world will keep looking the other way . "
changes ' needed ' but mr bolton acknowledged there had been hopeful signs of potential change in pyongyang , including attempts to improve its diplomatic relations with south korea and japan , and reports of economic changes .
mr bolton said the us was prepared to talk to the regime and take steps with its allies to help the country transform itself .
but he said the responsibility lay with pyongyang .
" north korea today faces a choice , " he said .
" if north korea wants to have a brighter future , it needs to fundamentally shift the way it operates at home and abroad . "
mr bolton also warned that a 1994 power deal under which pyongyang agreed to freeze its suspected nuclear programme in exchange for two light water reactors could be further delayed if the north did not allow in nuclear inspectors .
asked why he had chosen to make his comments at such a sensitive time , mr bolton told reporters he was simply " having a little straight talk among friends " .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : marconi refinancing deal bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point business contents : e-commerce -pipe- economy -pipe- market data thursday , 29 august , 2002 , 07:15 gmt 08:15 uk q & a : marconi refinancing deal marconi has negotiated a refinancing deal with its lenders to help pay down its crippling debt .
the company says its current shareholders will end up with just 0.5 % of the restructured company .
bbc news online takes a look at how the company got into this mess and asks what the deal means for marconi shareholders .
bring me up to speed - why is marconi in such financial trouble ?
marconi transformed itself from an industrial business - it was previously called gec - into a telecoms company at the height of the dot.com boom .
it expanded rapidly and bought a lot of other businesses at inflated prices .
at the time , banks were willing to lend marconi huge sums of money to do this .
but when the dot.com bubble fizzled out , marconi realised it had run up unmanageable debts and overpaid for its purchases .
so how much does it owe and how will this refinancing deal help ?
marconi owes about £ 4bn to its banks and bondholders - £ 2.7bn to a syndicate of 31 banks and £ 1.3bn to bondholders .
it has negotiated an agreement which gives the banks and bondholders virtually full control of the company , in return for cancelling a large chunk of the debt - what is known as a " debt for equity " swap .
the deal is expected to be completed by january 2003 , after which marconi says its debts should be down to about £ 300m .
what happens to shareholders ?
under the terms of the deal , the currently listed company marconi plc will effectively be sold to the lenders , and a new business , marconi corp , will be created .
it is in marconi corp that shareholders will then own a stake , although this will be a substantially reduced one .
in all , shareholders will own only 0.5 % of the new company between them .
shareholders will also be given warrants , which will allow them to buy another 5 % of the issued shares in the new company , once marconi 's market value has risen to £ 1.5bn.
however , this could take some time as marconi is currently valued at less than £ 50m .
are there a lot of private shareholders and can they protest about this ?
a large number of marconi 's shareholders are staff or private investors who own a small number of shares each .
marconi 's last annual report stated that there were 187,000 shareholders holding fewer than 5,000 shares .
that translates to 87 % of the shareholders - though they own just 10 % of the company between them .
the majority of the company , about 70 % , is owned by a few major institutions such as fidelity , colonial and first , and phillips and drew , who have very large shareholdings .
shareholders appear to have few options regarding the refinancing , as if they let marconi go bust , they get nothing .
also it 's unlikely shareholders will get a say in approving the restructuring as marconi has applied for a waiver from the uk financial watchdog , the financial services authority .
there is always the hope that the company will make a strong recovery and the shares will be worth more than they are now .
in marconi 's prime it was valued at 1240p per share , or £ 35bn .
since its downfall , shares have collapsed to just 1.7p , giving the company a market value of less than £ 50m .
how were things allowed to get so bad before anything was done ?
marconi 's critics say one of its biggest mistakes was not renegotiating the terms of its debt when it had the chance , last autumn .
the company was under pressure to repay its debt by march 2003 .
after the company issued a profit warning , the banks offered to extend the repayment date to 2005 , in return for higher interest charges .
marconi 's board refused and stuck to its pledge to cut 25 % off its debt by march 2002 .
but as the telecoms downturn worsened , so marconi 's debt increased and the banks got tougher .
why did n't the banks just let marconi go bust ?
for all that has gone on , marconi is still worth more as a going concern than if it is left to collapse .
it has a lot of loyal customers and if it can keep them on board , that is the best way to maximise the value of the business and for banks to see some return on their loans .
customers are quite likely to remain loyal too , as it is relatively difficult to just swap suppliers .
why are n't other companies in the sector in the same trouble ?
a lot of them are !
the whole telecom sector has crashed dramatically leaving even the bigger groups like nortel , lucent and alcatel with huge debts .
a few of them have managed to raise money on the stock market to pay down debt , such as lucent .
but almost all have suffered huge job losses , as marconi did too .
the difference with some of the larger companies is that the levels of debt relative to the overall size of the business is smaller or has been borrowed over longer periods of time .
what happens now - are there any signs of recovery in the sector ?
in a word - no .
there have been a few flickers but no real improvements in trading in the sector and the short term outlook remains weak .
but with the whole sector struggling , it is likely that some consolidation is on the horizon .
and marconi is a likely target .
analysts have suggested the networking group cisco , which has substantial reserves of cash , might be interested in buying marconi .

the island says it will allow chinese companies to advertise their products on the island .
and it will make it easier for chinese employees of large firms to work in taiwan .
in a process that began last year , taiwan is slowly dismantling its 50-year-old restrictions on trade with mainland china .
in the latest move , the chairwoman of taiwan 's mainland affairs council , tsai ing-wen , has announced that she wants to end a ban on chinese firms advertising goods and property on the island .
she said she is submitting changes to the law to be approved by taiwan 's parliament .
more people from mainland china will be able to make business trips to taiwan , and chinese employees of multinational , or taiwanese , companies will be allowed to work in taiwan .
taiwan 's government wants to try to balance up its economic exchanges with china .
at present the majority of the money of investment has been in one direction , from taiwan to china .
it is hoped the changes will help boost the island 's advertising and media industries .
taiwan 's government has been under pressure from local companies to make it easier to do business across the taiwan strait .
direct links stuck vast amounts of trade are already done with its old political rival , and the island 's government is having to update its laws to reflect the new reality .
on the biggest issue of all though - opening up direct shipping , transport and postal links with mainland china - there is little sign of progress .
the two sides are still not talking to each other , and remarks by taiwan 's president , chen shui-bian , earlier this month , that the island is a separate country from china , angered beijing .
there is no sign it will be willing to sit down and negotiate with his government in the near future .

a survey of the prison numbers released on thursday revealed that hmp swansea was holding 145 more inmates than the 219 it should be accommodating .
prisons across the uk need updating research by the pressure group the howard league for penal reform said that nearly two-thirds of britain 's prisoners were being held in overcrowded jails .
it estimated that 52,500 people were in jails running above capacity - with some buildings holding almost double the number of recommended inmates .
the latest revelation is another blow for swansea prison - a category b establishment , built in 1861 - which has suffered a series of criticisms in recent months .
in april , an inspector 's report called for urgent attention to the prison 's b wing to avoid it collapsing .
it also said work should be done to improve cleanliness and sanitation , and that segregated and vulnerable patients in an underground part of the prison should be provided with toilets .
although the hard work of staff was recognised by the inspector , the prison is a victorian institution struggling to meet modern standards .
our prisons are becoming no more than warehouses once again frances crook , howard league the latest figures highlighting overcrowding will renew calls for the building to be modernised or replaced .
soaring prison numbers mean that many prisoners are doubling up in cells meant for one .
the worst prison in britain was named as hmp preston with 661 prisoners - but only 356 places .
director of the howard league , frances crook , has called on the government to include a compulsory limit on the prison population in the criminal justice bill - due to be published later this year .
" our prisons are becoming no more than warehouses once again , " she said .
" the consequences of overcrowding are jeopardising both the safe running of the prison system and the rehabilitation of individual offenders .
" if prison is to serve any useful purpose it must be to return prisoners to the community better equipped to lead crime-free lives .
" the current crisis effectively precludes this . "
population rise the prison population currently stands at 71,471 and is beginning to climb after a drop of several hundred earlier in the summer .
this rise goes against the normal summer-time pattern of an overall fall in the number of inmates .
prison numbers have spiralled from 45,500 in june 1992 , and have jumped 6,000 since the start of the year .
overall , 64 jails are now overcrowded , said the charity .
the figures are taken from the home office research , development and statistics directorate .
the occupancy figures relate to the number of prisoners jails were built to hold . watch / listen on this story bbc wales ' wesley dodd " this is the latest in a long line of critisms " see also : 30 jul 02 -pipe- uk why there are record numbers in prison 12 jul 02 -pipe- uk prison over-crowding crisis 01 mar 02 -pipe- uk head to head : overcrowded prisons 30 aug 01 -pipe- scotland prison overcrowding increases internet links : prison officer 's association the howard league for penal reform home office the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : boyfriend sought in murder inquiry girl will wait for jailed ' rapist ' lover cash boost for brecon jazz hello !

arcadia brands dorothy perkins burton evans wallis top shop top man miss selfridge now offering up to 408 pence per share , mr green decided to press ahead even though his first bid was rejected by the board of arcadia .
the new offer values arcadia at £ 770m -lrb- $ 1.2bn -rrb- .
the deal would create the biggest fashion retail group in the uk , with up to 40,000 employees , a string of top high street names in its portfolio , and about a 30 % share of the uk clothing market .
arcadia 's shares soared in reaction to the news , gaining nearly 50p to trade at 392p .
the firm 's board said it was " considering its response " .
if arcadia 's directors accept the deal , they stand to earn a cash windfall of about £ 30m through the shares they hold in the company .
arcadia chief executive stuart rose alone would be set to net £ 20m .
mr green 's offer is subject to a number of conditions though , chiefly that arcadia 's board finally recommends the deal to shareholders , and " the finalisation of financing arrangements " .
soaring shares mr green 's bid is backed by the icelandic retailer baugur , which is a 20 % shareholder in arcadia .
the new offer is dependent on baugur selling most of its arcadia stake to mr green , while in return buying some of the group 's assets for itself .
baugur is said to be interested in the british firm 's young fashion brands - top man , top shop and miss selfridge .
arcadia shares have soared in recent days , to 343.5p on wednesday evening .
mr green 's first offer 10 days ago was for 365p a share , at a time when arcadia stock traded at about 300 pence .
but arcadia 's board rejected the approach , saying the offer was too low .
back then arcadia 's chief executive stuart rose told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " we do n't think it offers value for the business " .
" philip green has never knowingly overpaid for a business , " he added .
but mr green hit back at the suggestion that his bid fell short of the mark .
empire building philip green 's success at reviving bhs has earned him the respect of the fashion retail industry and he is keen to expand his empire .
he was involved in merger talks with woolworths in june this year , and takeover talks with marks and spencer in march last year , but both ended without a deal .
he is thought to be considering making an offer for littlewoods ' stores .

the zyklon trainer provoked outrage from jewish groups , prompting manufacturer umbro to apologise for the mistake and " regret any offence caused " .
zyklon b crystals were used to exterminate millions of jewish people across europe as part of hitler 's nazi regime .
commercial appropriation of words carrying connotations of mass murder is utterly unacceptable dr stephen smith , beth shalom holocaust centre umbro , which makes the england football kit , said the use of the name was " purely coincidental " and not designed to have any connotations .
dr shimon samuels , of international human rights organisation the simon wiesenthal centre , said in a letter to umbro that its " outrageous misuse of the holocaust is an insult to its victims and survivors " .
dr stephen smith , co-founder of the beth shalom holocaust centre in nottinghamshire , said : " commercial appropriation of words carrying connotations of mass murder is utterly unacceptable .
" considering the care with which companies normally choose titles for their products , i also find it hard to believe umbro 's assertion that the naming of the shoe was ' purely coincidental ' .
' innocent ' mistake " any investigation of the word , on the internet for example , quickly reveals its links to the holocaust . "
nick crook , from umbro , said : " we regret that there are people who are offended by the name . "
zyklon b was used at auschwitz umbro said the zyklon name , which was chosen by a designer in the firm 's footwear department , had been on the side of boxes for the trainer since its launch in 1999 , but does not appear on the shoe itself .
mr crook said : " i do n't think the person who named them knew what it would mean to some people .
" i can tell you it was n't chosen deliberately for its unfortunate meaning . "
" i think in future we will be checking the names we use more carefully . "
zyklon b was originally used as an insecticide but found to turn into a lethal gas when its crystals were exposed to the air .
