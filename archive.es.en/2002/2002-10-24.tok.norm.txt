"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .
but he added , " i don ’ t think the court allowed its judgement to be persuaded by the fact that it was a celebrity on trial .

the eastern regions have suffered an estimated 23 billion euro -lrb- $ 22.45 billion -rrb- in damage , according to the german magazine " der spiegel . " between the german government , the states and the european union , some 10 billion euro have been pledged to the country ’ s flood-damaged east .
in the course of this year and next , some 13.5 billion euros will have been pumped into rebuilding the region . beneficiaries of rebuilding the construction , industry and service sectors , particularly transport firms , are expected to be the main beneficiaries of rebuilding .
it comes as welcome news for construction firms .
six weeks ago , germany ’ s construction industry association -lrb- hdb -rrb- predicted a 5.2 percent decline and the loss of 80,000 jobs in construction before the end of the year . in the short-term , things are looking up in germany 's eastern states .
the floods have brought in a wave of new cash for the region , and the local economy has shown itself to be less susceptible to the global economic flu than germany 's western states due to lower reliance on exports . back to the drawing board however , the new economic stimulus is expected to be short-lived .
once the flood-affected areas are rebuilt , the region will find itself in the same position it was in before the rains .
despite the positive news for germany 's east , the recently released study by germany 's leading economists also indicates that unemployment , at its highest in eastern germany , will continue to rise next year along with prices and employment costs . in addition , growth in germany 's eastern states is still low compared to the west , with gdp reaching only 60 percent of the western german level due to a dearth of industry . manfred stolpe , the government ’ s new minister responsible for " aufbau ost , " the program to redevelop the states that once belonged to east germany , former has his work cut out for him . last week he told a german public radio station : " there is a lot to do .

"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .
but he added , " i don ’ t think the court allowed its judgement to be persuaded by the fact that it was a celebrity on trial .

the eastern regions have suffered an estimated 23 billion euro -lrb- $ 22.45 billion -rrb- in damage , according to the german magazine " der spiegel . " between the german government , the states and the european union , some 10 billion euro have been pledged to the country ’ s flood-damaged east .
in the course of this year and next , some 13.5 billion euros will have been pumped into rebuilding the region . beneficiaries of rebuilding the construction , industry and service sectors , particularly transport firms , are expected to be the main beneficiaries of rebuilding .
it comes as welcome news for construction firms .
six weeks ago , germany ’ s construction industry association -lrb- hdb -rrb- predicted a 5.2 percent decline and the loss of 80,000 jobs in construction before the end of the year . in the short-term , things are looking up in germany 's eastern states .
the floods have brought in a wave of new cash for the region , and the local economy has shown itself to be less susceptible to the global economic flu than germany 's western states due to lower reliance on exports . back to the drawing board however , the new economic stimulus is expected to be short-lived .
once the flood-affected areas are rebuilt , the region will find itself in the same position it was in before the rains .
despite the positive news for germany 's east , the recently released study by germany 's leading economists also indicates that unemployment , at its highest in eastern germany , will continue to rise next year along with prices and employment costs . in addition , growth in germany 's eastern states is still low compared to the west , with gdp reaching only 60 percent of the western german level due to a dearth of industry . manfred stolpe , the government ’ s new minister responsible for " aufbau ost , " the program to redevelop the states that once belonged to east germany , former has his work cut out for him . last week he told a german public radio station : " there is a lot to do .

"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .

"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .
but he added , " i don ’ t think the court allowed its judgement to be persuaded by the fact that it was a celebrity on trial .

"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .
but he added , " i don ’ t think the court allowed its judgement to be persuaded by the fact that it was a celebrity on trial .

"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .
but he added , " i don ’ t think the court allowed its judgement to be persuaded by the fact that it was a celebrity on trial .

the eastern regions have suffered an estimated 23 billion euro -lrb- $ 22.45 billion -rrb- in damage , according to the german magazine " der spiegel . " between the german government , the states and the european union , some 10 billion euro have been pledged to the country ’ s flood-damaged east .
in the course of this year and next , some 13.5 billion euros will have been pumped into rebuilding the region . beneficiaries of rebuilding the construction , industry and service sectors , particularly transport firms , are expected to be the main beneficiaries of rebuilding .

"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .
but he added , " i don ’ t think the court allowed its judgement to be persuaded by the fact that it was a celebrity on trial .

"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .

the eastern regions have suffered an estimated 23 billion euro -lrb- $ 22.45 billion -rrb- in damage , according to the german magazine " der spiegel . " between the german government , the states and the european union , some 10 billion euro have been pledged to the country ’ s flood-damaged east .
in the course of this year and next , some 13.5 billion euros will have been pumped into rebuilding the region . beneficiaries of rebuilding the construction , industry and service sectors , particularly transport firms , are expected to be the main beneficiaries of rebuilding .
it comes as welcome news for construction firms .
six weeks ago , germany ’ s construction industry association -lrb- hdb -rrb- predicted a 5.2 percent decline and the loss of 80,000 jobs in construction before the end of the year . in the short-term , things are looking up in germany 's eastern states .
the floods have brought in a wave of new cash for the region , and the local economy has shown itself to be less susceptible to the global economic flu than germany 's western states due to lower reliance on exports . back to the drawing board however , the new economic stimulus is expected to be short-lived .
once the flood-affected areas are rebuilt , the region will find itself in the same position it was in before the rains .
despite the positive news for germany 's east , the recently released study by germany 's leading economists also indicates that unemployment , at its highest in eastern germany , will continue to rise next year along with prices and employment costs . in addition , growth in germany 's eastern states is still low compared to the west , with gdp reaching only 60 percent of the western german level due to a dearth of industry . manfred stolpe , the government ’ s new minister responsible for " aufbau ost , " the program to redevelop the states that once belonged to east germany , former has his work cut out for him . last week he told a german public radio station : " there is a lot to do .

"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .
but he added , " i don ’ t think the court allowed its judgement to be persuaded by the fact that it was a celebrity on trial .

"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .
but he added , " i don ’ t think the court allowed its judgement to be persuaded by the fact that it was a celebrity on trial .

the eastern regions have suffered an estimated 23 billion euro -lrb- $ 22.45 billion -rrb- in damage , according to the german magazine " der spiegel . " between the german government , the states and the european union , some 10 billion euro have been pledged to the country ’ s flood-damaged east .
in the course of this year and next , some 13.5 billion euros will have been pumped into rebuilding the region . beneficiaries of rebuilding the construction , industry and service sectors , particularly transport firms , are expected to be the main beneficiaries of rebuilding .
it comes as welcome news for construction firms .
six weeks ago , germany ’ s construction industry association -lrb- hdb -rrb- predicted a 5.2 percent decline and the loss of 80,000 jobs in construction before the end of the year . in the short-term , things are looking up in germany 's eastern states .
the floods have brought in a wave of new cash for the region , and the local economy has shown itself to be less susceptible to the global economic flu than germany 's western states due to lower reliance on exports . back to the drawing board however , the new economic stimulus is expected to be short-lived .
once the flood-affected areas are rebuilt , the region will find itself in the same position it was in before the rains .
despite the positive news for germany 's east , the recently released study by germany 's leading economists also indicates that unemployment , at its highest in eastern germany , will continue to rise next year along with prices and employment costs . in addition , growth in germany 's eastern states is still low compared to the west , with gdp reaching only 60 percent of the western german level due to a dearth of industry . manfred stolpe , the government ’ s new minister responsible for " aufbau ost , " the program to redevelop the states that once belonged to east germany , former has his work cut out for him . last week he told a german public radio station : " there is a lot to do .

in the course of this year and next , some 13.5 billion euros will have been pumped into rebuilding the region . beneficiaries of rebuilding the construction , industry and service sectors , particularly transport firms , are expected to be the main beneficiaries of rebuilding .
it comes as welcome news for construction firms .
six weeks ago , germany ’ s construction industry association -lrb- hdb -rrb- predicted a 5.2 percent decline and the loss of 80,000 jobs in construction before the end of the year . in the short-term , things are looking up in germany 's eastern states .
the floods have brought in a wave of new cash for the region , and the local economy has shown itself to be less susceptible to the global economic flu than germany 's western states due to lower reliance on exports . back to the drawing board however , the new economic stimulus is expected to be short-lived .
once the flood-affected areas are rebuilt , the region will find itself in the same position it was in before the rains .
despite the positive news for germany 's east , the recently released study by germany 's leading economists also indicates that unemployment , at its highest in eastern germany , will continue to rise next year along with prices and employment costs . in addition , growth in germany 's eastern states is still low compared to the west , with gdp reaching only 60 percent of the western german level due to a dearth of industry . manfred stolpe , the government ’ s new minister responsible for " aufbau ost , " the program to redevelop the states that once belonged to east germany , former has his work cut out for him . last week he told a german public radio station : " there is a lot to do .

"
a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine . with words of relief , germany ’ s biggest tennis star left a court room in munich on thursday after receiving a two-year suspended sentence and a 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 292 , 000 -rrb- fine for failing to pay more than one million euro in taxes to the german state between 1991 and 1993 .
" i ’ m free – that ’ s the most important thing , " becker said upon being questioned by a large group of reporters .
" i ’ m so happy this difficult and problem-laden time in my life is finally over . "
celebrity court case becker ’ s match against the german tax authorities reached a head this week when the 34-year-old celebrity appeared in front of munich ’ s regional court and admitted he had made " mistakes " in his past financial dealings .
becker denied that he had deliberately tried to cheat the system .
" i admit that i made a mistake 10 years ago , and i know that i will have to pay the consequences for that , " he said at the start of the trial on wednesday .
becker ’ s lawyers also announced that a week prior to his court date , becker had paid the state three million euro in back taxes , far exceeding the amount he owed the state .
it was an attempt to settle the affair without going all the way to court .
german state prosecutors , however , remained adamant about penalizing the three-time wimbledon winner , who since retiring from his professional tennis career three years ago has made millions with television commercials .
state prosecutor matthias musiol insisted on a sentence of three years and six months in jail , saying that becker ’ s outstanding tax bill – estimated at some 1.7 million euro – and the length of time he avoided authorities required a stiff sentencing .
question of residence the court case focused primarily on the question of where the tennis star lived between 1991 and 1993 , the period for which he owed taxes .
becker claimed that he resided permanently in the tax haven of monaco , and therefore was exempt from paying german taxes .
but german tax authorities said becker was living at least part-time in the southern german city of munich .
" i stayed at times in a spartan flat in munich between the autumn of 1991 and 1993 that had just a bed and a couch but didn ’ t even have a refrigerator , " becker told the court .
" i was permanently on the road ...
the world ‘ home ’ didn ’ t really exist for me . "
weakened sentence in the end , prosecutors could not convince the court of the weightiness of becker ’ s guilt , and the judge passed a considerably lighter sentence than requested .
becker received a two-year suspended sentence , a fine of 300,000 euro , and an additional sum of 200,000 euro payable to charitable causes .
becker ’ s lawyers , who had pushed for a suspended sentence as the maximum penalty , said they were " absolutely satisfied " with thursday ’ s outcome .
state prosecutor musiol , however , said he would push for a review of the sentence , saying it was far below what his office had requested .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- true spies -pipe- former num chief was police informer news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : programmes : true spies news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk thursday , 24 october , 2002 , 04:14 gmt 05:14 uk former num chief was police informer special branch were told about possible strikes joe gormley , former president of the national union of miners -lrb- num -rrb- , was a special branch informant during the 1970s , a bbc investigation has revealed .
in a remarkably candid interview for the new bbc two series true spies , a former special branch officer claims that mr gormley passed on details of arthur scargill 's and other miners ' plans for industrial action in the early 1970s .
but , despite receiving warnings from the top of the union , mi5 and the government failed to head off the 1972 strike .
in fact , the special branch officer - referred to only as alan - claims that mi5 told the government the strike would not happen , with devastating consequences for the leadership of the day .
gormley ' feared militants ' edward heath 's government was toppled in 1974 , following mass industrial action , in what became known as the " who runs the country " election .
the officer claims that mr gormley , a right-wing trade unionist , was increasingly concerned that the far left was gaining control of the union and agreed to talk to special branch .
joe gormley kept special branch informed alan told the programme : " the extreme left were getting the upper hand and were dictating the policy of the unions to some great extent , then we found ourselves actually going to unions and talking to the top union officials about what was going on .
" one of them would be joe gormley ... certainly he was in a position of power and was in a position to furnish us with what we were looking for . "
scargill ' not surprised ' alan added that joe gormley turned informer because " he loved his country .
he was a patriot and he was very wary and worried about the growth of militancy within his own union " .
but arthur scargill himself was not surprised by mr gormley 's actions , saying : " the history of our movement is littered with people in leadership positions who were either connected with special branch or connected with the state . "
any self-respecting trade unionist should not co-operate in that way jack dromey , tgwu joe gormley , who died in 1993 and was president of the num until 1982 , was not the only trades union leader to have links with the " secret state " .
true spies reporter peter taylor discovered that special branch was talking to more than 20 senior trades union leaders during the early 1970s .
this revelation did not shock mr scargill either , who said he was only surprised that there were not even more spies within the unions .
but jack dromey , a senior official within the transport and general workers ' union -lrb- tgwu -rrb- , condemned mr gormley 's informer role as " shameful " .
he said : " any self-respecting trade unionist should not co-operate in that way with those regarding their members to be a threat to the state .
-lsb- it is -rsb- outrageous . "
ford employees ' vetted ' another special branch officer claims that ford , which had a giant car manufacturing plant at halewood on merseyside , only agreed to invest there because of a suspected secret deal with mi5 and special branch .
tony robinson : ' it was important to monitor unions ' according to former special branch officer tony robinson the entire workforce was routinely vetted .
he said : " my senior officer said : ' one of your responsibilities , tony , is to make certain that the ford factory is kept clean of subversives . '
" and part of the plan drawn up was to make certain that work would carry on smoothly at ford without the expected merseyside disease of strikes and layoffs . "
he told the programme that every week ford would secretly submit a list of the latest job applicants to the local special branch .
" we were expected to check these lists against our known subversives , and if any were seen on the list then strike a line through it , " he said .
he added : " it was very , very important that the unions were monitored , and i , as a special branch officer , make no apologies for doing it as efficiently as i could .
activist denied ford job " we 're talking about thousands and thousands of families dependent on continued employment ... you have a small group of subversives who can bring that factory to a stop , then i think the ends justify the means . "
reporter peter taylor also talked to tom , a former trades union activist and communist party member , who was secretly vetted by special branch and denied a job at ford 's halewood plant .
tom is very bitter and says : " how can you be proud of britain when there 's things like that going on ? "
others are also outraged that special branch should have been able to vet employees .
jack dromey said : " the manufacture of ford capris is a wee bit different from the production of nuclear warheads .
the idea that you blacklist somebody , because of their politics , from going in to make cars is crazy . "
a ford spokesman said : " we can not confirm that police special branch officers were involved in any way in the checking of job applicants or the alleged agreement with mi5 . "
the first programme in the true spies series was shown on bbc two on sunday 27 october 2002 .

bill speirs has accused prime minister tony blair of " hugely devaluing " an independent review of fire service pay and conditions .
he has also called on the government to open up talks with the fire brigades union -lrb- fbu -rrb- to prevent a strike .
mr speirs claimed there were people around mr blair who were taking the kind of approach margaret thatcher had to the miners .
bill speirs : " potential disaster " firefighters across the uk are set to carry out a series of stoppages .
the first two-day action will begin on 29 october , followed by five further strikes in the run-up to christmas .
the fbu is seeking a 40 % wage increase which would change the basic pay level for qualified firefighters from £ 21,500 to £ 30,000 .
the government said that was impossible and attacked the fbu 's refusal to take part in an independent pay and conditions review , which would be coupled with a 4 % interim pay rise .
mr speirs , a former chairman of the scottish labour party , has accused the government of taking a rigid line over the dispute .
he said : " to refuse to engage in negotiations , i genuinely ca n't understand why that is the case .
fire facts scotland has 4,588 full-time firefighters 2,799 part-time firefighters 1,200 volunteer firefighters 520 fire engines 30 aerial appliances 14 rescue and emergency vehicles 59 other specialist vehicles 109 green godesses will be used in scotland " if the government were to engage in negotiations just now with the firefighters ' union , the worst that could happen is that nothing changes . "
he claimed there were people around the prime minister who were taking the kind of approach that margaret thatcher had adopted with the miners in the 1980s .
" i genuinely do n't believe that this is the view of the majority of the cabinet and i think they have taken their eye off the ball .
" they do n't realise the potential disaster here , for the country and for the labour movement . "
and he argued that the government was mistaken if it thought that it would gain an advantage by taking on the firefighters and winning .
entirely reasonable mr speirs claimed that mr blair had devalued sir george bain 's independent review of the fire service by saying there was no way firefighters could be paid £ 30,000 a year .
" what happens if the independent review says that they should be ? " he said .
scottish secretary helen liddell rejected criticism of the government 's handling of the dispute .
she said : " we value firefighters .
the difference between us and mrs thatcher and the miners is she did not value the miners and the action that was taken at that time destroyed the coal mining industry in this country . "
mrs liddell insisted the government had been " entirely reasonable " in its attempts to meet the firefighters ' demands .

bill speirs has accused prime minister tony blair of " hugely devaluing " an independent review of fire service pay and conditions .
he has also called on the government to open up talks with the fire brigades union -lrb- fbu -rrb- to prevent a strike .
mr speirs claimed there were people around mr blair who were taking the kind of approach margaret thatcher had to the miners .
bill speirs : " potential disaster " firefighters across the uk are set to carry out a series of stoppages .
the first two-day action will begin on 29 october , followed by five further strikes in the run-up to christmas .
the fbu is seeking a 40 % wage increase which would change the basic pay level for qualified firefighters from £ 21,500 to £ 30,000 .
the government said that was impossible and attacked the fbu 's refusal to take part in an independent pay and conditions review , which would be coupled with a 4 % interim pay rise .
mr speirs , a former chairman of the scottish labour party , has accused the government of taking a rigid line over the dispute .
he said : " to refuse to engage in negotiations , i genuinely ca n't understand why that is the case .
fire facts scotland has 4,588 full-time firefighters 2,799 part-time firefighters 1,200 volunteer firefighters 520 fire engines 30 aerial appliances 14 rescue and emergency vehicles 59 other specialist vehicles 109 green godesses will be used in scotland " if the government were to engage in negotiations just now with the firefighters ' union , the worst that could happen is that nothing changes . "
he claimed there were people around the prime minister who were taking the kind of approach that margaret thatcher had adopted with the miners in the 1980s .
" i genuinely do n't believe that this is the view of the majority of the cabinet and i think they have taken their eye off the ball .
" they do n't realise the potential disaster here , for the country and for the labour movement . "
and he argued that the government was mistaken if it thought that it would gain an advantage by taking on the firefighters and winning .
entirely reasonable mr speirs claimed that mr blair had devalued sir george bain 's independent review of the fire service by saying there was no way firefighters could be paid £ 30,000 a year .
" what happens if the independent review says that they should be ? " he said .
scottish secretary helen liddell rejected criticism of the government 's handling of the dispute .
she said : " we value firefighters .
the difference between us and mrs thatcher and the miners is she did not value the miners and the action that was taken at that time destroyed the coal mining industry in this country . "
mrs liddell insisted the government had been " entirely reasonable " in its attempts to meet the firefighters ' demands .

the country 's finance minister silvan shalom may ask the us government for the guarantees as part of a larger aid program to be submitted at the beginning of 2003 .
the reports came as israel 's finance ministry submitted its 2003 budget to parliament .
it showed a cut in government spending as the country struggles to recover from a deep recession and rising defence costs .
call for help the finance minister said that israel had discussed the issue of loan guarantees with us officials last week .
" the issue of loan guarantees has been worked on for a while , " mr shalom told reporters .
" we are in the beginning stages and nothing is concrete yet .
we are looking at all options . "
loan guarantees would make it easier for israel to raise funds and stimulate investment in its recession-hit economy .
the last two years have seen the country battered by both the bursting of the tech-boom and the rising cost of fighting the palestinian uprising , pushing the country into its worst recession for 25 years .
mr shalom would not put a figure on the possible guarantees israel was seeking , although newspaper reports have suggested they could total $ 10bn -lrb- £ 6.4bn -rrb- .
and in return ?
in 1991 , israel received guarantees for loans of $ 10bn to help it cope with the influx of immigrants from the former soviet union .
however , the conditions attached to the 1991 loans were that israel would not spend any of the money raised in palestinian territories . "
passing the budget and keeping to the budget are the most important things now " silvan shalom , finance minister there are now concerns that in return for the latest loan guarantees , the us will impose conditions , in particular with regards to a possible attack on iraq .
tightening belts israel 's finance minister has also urged parliament to approve the latest budget , aimed at giving the economy much-needed stability .
" passing the budget and keeping to the budget are the most important things now , " mr shalom said .
if the budget fails , the country 's credit rating could be at risk - making the task of raising money yet more difficult .
israel 's economy shrank by 0.9 % in 2001 and is expected to contract by a similar amount in 2002 .
three years ago , it was growing at a rate of 6 % .
the 2003 state budget is the country 's largest ever at 269.9bn shekels -lrb- $ 57bn -rrb- .
but it includes a proposal to cut defence spending by 2.6 % and to also reduce social spending in an effort to raise economic growth to 1 % .
the budget has so far met with little support from opposition parties and coalition partners .

australia and new zealand bank -lrb- anz -rrb- saw its net income - before one-off costs - shoot up 16 % in the year to september to a $ 2.2bn -lrb- -rrb- .
the increase , it said , was partly due to the surge in its business handling the affairs of wealthy private clients .
but like its fellow lenders , anz has done very well out of the massive surge in credit card debt , fed by a booming economy and interest rates at 30-year lows .
the boom years the bank 's performance was well ahead of forecasts , which had expected a 10 % boost to profits over last year .
but the growth in consumer spending - the engine keeping economies around the world above water as the downturn persists - meant the second half of the year produced record profits , up 30 % on the same period last year .
the booming australian housing market also contributed to performance , the bank said .
but chief executive john mcfarlane was at pains to warn that the housing explosion was coming to an end .
" the housing market is overheating and is prone to decline , " he said , although he said an upswing in business credit might fill in some of the gap .
so far banks like anz and rivals national australia bank have been protected from the bad international loan problems which have beset peers in the us and europe by the strong home economy , growing at about 4 % a year .
anz shares rose 2 % in morning trading .

now comes the grubby stuff ... now they have to talk about money . "
we all know what 's at stake , we all know the amount of money which is on the table " danish foreign minister per stig moller european union leaders are meeting in brussels on thursday and friday to try to hammer out the financial deal which will allow enlargement to go ahead .
the process which is due to add 10 new countries to the union by 2004 will not be cheap - and there are very different views about how and when to pay for it .
broadly speaking , there are two camps - one led by germany which pays the most money into the eu budget , the other led by france which gets the most money back in farming and other subsidies .
both sides have been digging in their heels .
political will germany and its allies - britain , sweden and the netherlands - want a commitment that there will be reform of the eu 's hugely expensive common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which accounts for nearly half the union 's total budget of 95bn euros -lrb- $ 95bn -rrb- .
without reform they fear the budget could spin out of control once new countries like poland , with a huge agricultural population , join .
france says reform can not even be discussed until 2006 , well after enlargement is supposed to take place . "
every eu leader will be looking round the table to see who is prepared to put their hand in their pocket " the french also point out that the current eu budget already includes money to pay for enlargement .
somehow the eu needs to find some middle ground , which will also allow it to decide how much money to offer the 10 candidate countries in the first years after they join the union .
most of the would-be members are poor by eu standards , and they are expecting a fair deal .
the danish foreign minister , per stig moller , argues that it is now a question of political will .
" we all know what 's at stake , we all know the amount of money which is on the table , " mr moller says .
" if you ca n't do it now you never will do it . "
risk of delay the danes - who will be chairing this summit - fear a domino effect , if there is no deal on money this week .
delay in brussels could lead to delay in negotiating the financial package with the candidate countries themselves .
that in turn would make it very difficult to wrap up the enlargement talks by the end of this year as planned .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , has warned that the eu should beware of " jeopardising the success of enlargement by wrangling over the details " .
like others supporters of enlargement , he argues that the initial costs will be more than outweighed by the long term economic benefits of creating a larger union .
but nothing raises hackles within the eu as much as money .
if now is the time to be generous , then every eu leader will be looking round the table to see who is prepared to put their hand in their pocket .
