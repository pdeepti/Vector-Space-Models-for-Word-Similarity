the 280 million euro -lrb- $ 272.6m -rrb- stadium gets its official name from a long-term marketing partnership between the german insurance company allianz and the stadium 's own holding company münchen stadion gmbh .

the ernst & young item club , a forecaster that uses the same economic model as the uk treasury , put the blame on the jittery global economy combined with lower tax receipts from once-prosperous sources such as city workers .
since treasury rules forbid any significant increase in borrowing , " higher spending now means higher taxes , " said professor peter spencer , item 's economic adviser .
the forecast is the gloomiest assessment so far of britain 's once-healthy public finances ; most economists have predicted that mr brown will miss his deficit targets to some extent , but estimates have tended to go no higher than £ 5bn .
too little , too late ?
mr brown has already raised taxes this year , proposing an increase in national insurance and other measures to help fund an increase in spending on public services .
but the item club warned that it was not enough .
according to professor spencer , a drop-off in income tax receipts has been the result of the collapse in the technology sector , and the fading fortunes of wealthy financial workers .
and the slowing economy has also hit receipts from capital gains tax and from corporation tax .
" there 's weakness right across the board on the inland revenue - the only bright spot is vat which continues to rise as long as the high street keeps on going , " professor spencer told bbc radio five live .
the item club says there is a 50 % probability that higher taxes will be needed next year if the chancellor is to avoid breaking his ' golden rule ' .
" his golden rule allows him to borrow to finance investment - that 's schools and hospitals , " professor spencer said .
" it unfortunately does n't allow him to borrow to finance the teachers , doctors and nurses - i.e. current expenditure - and it 's because he 's so close to breaking the golden rule that he will have to put taxes up , perhaps not in april but at some point over the next couple of years . "
slowdown separately , the item club forecast that economic growth would slow to just 1.5 % this year , well below mr brown 's april prediction of 2-2.5 % .
it also predicted that the bank of england would leave interest rates on hold until early next year because of the continued strength of the housing market .
in a rare spot of partial cheer , the club said it did not foresee a crash in the housing market , which it said was likely to be buoyed by high employment .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- cancer map reveals under-funding news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : health news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health medical notes - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk monday , 21 october , 2002 , 05:56 gmt 06:56 uk cancer map reveals under-funding some of the uk 's biggest cancer killers get only a fraction of the funding they deserve , a new " map " of research spending reveals .
the national cancer research institute has produced the first ever comprehensive breakdown of cancer research in the uk .
it is hoping that the database will stop research money from different funding bodies being wasted on the same type of project .
however , the research has revealed that some cancers which cause relatively few fatalities fare much better in funding terms than others responsible for thousands of deaths each year .
lung loss the prime example is lung cancer - the cancer which kills the most people in the uk each year .
it gets only 3 % of the available funding in the uk - but accounted for 22 % of the total deaths from cancer in 2000 .
armed with this we can see where we are at the moment and we can start to plan better where we want to get to in the future dr liam o 'toole , director , ncri leukaemia , on the other hand , receives almost 18 % of the total funding , yet accounts for far fewer deaths - approximately 3 % .
breast cancer also attracts almost 18 % of the available money , and is responsible for approximately 8 % of the deaths .
other hard-to-treat cancers such as pancreas and stomach also attract far less funding than their high death rate seems to demand .
dr liam o 'toole , the ncri 's director , said that the map would inform future decisions on research funding .
he said : " at last we have a clear map of cancer research in the uk .
" armed with this we can see where we are at the moment and we can start to plan better where we want to get to in the future , in order to provide the new diagnostic tools and treatments that we still so badly need in many cancers . "
biggest funders the institute pooled research figures from the 15 largest cancer research funding organisations , including cancer research uk , the department of health and the medical research council .
even this does not give a totally reliable figure for the total spent in the uk on cancer research .
a collective annual estimate is in the region of £ 350m .
more than a fifth of the spending goes into research into treatment , 16 % on studies into the possible causes of cancers , while early detection and diagnosis research takes 8 % .
however , research into cancer prevention takes only 2 % of the total .
professor mike richards , the government 's national cancer director , said : " for the first time , we have a very useful overview of cancer research in this country .
" now we will be working together to address the gaps . "
new approach needed dame gill oliver , of the charity macmillan cancer relief , welcomed the new inititiave .
however , she said : " there needs to be a shift in emphasis in cancer research to involve patients in both setting the research questions and finding out the answers .
" randomised controlled trials are not always the best way to find out about what makes a patient feel better .
" we also need to use qualitative research and patient led observational studies . "
sir paul nurse , director general of the charity cancer research uk , described the map as a milestone .
" the report enables the research community to identify where there are spending shortfalls across the uk and plan for the future .
" its publication is particularly timely because at the end of this month our top 300 scientists will be meeting to discuss cancer research uk 's research strategy for the next five years and the report ¹ s findings will inform this planning process .
" however , identifying potential gaps is very complicated and not simply a case of comparing the incidence or mortality of a cancer type with current spend .
" for example , research into the basic understanding of breast cancer will provide insights into a range of other cancer types as well . " watch / listen on this story the bbc 's mathew hill " there are wide differences between what is spent on different types of cancers " national cancer research institute 's dr liam o 'toole " this is the first time we 've had a clear picture of the cancer research going on in the uk " see also : 10 oct 02 -pipe- health cancer patients ' rosier future 04 jun 02 -pipe- health uk misses out on lung cancer lift 05 jun 02 -pipe- health europe cancer league unveiled 23 oct 01 -pipe- health european cancer patients ' raw deal internet links : national cancer research institute cancer research uk department of health the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top health stories now : heart risk link to big families back pain drug ' may aid diabetics ' congo ebola outbreak confirmed vegetables ward off alzheimer 's polio campaign launched in iraq gene defect explains high blood pressure botox ' may cause new wrinkles ' alien ' abductees ' show real symptoms links to more health stories are at the foot of the page .

the irish are praised for behaving responsibly and not punishing the candidate states .
and there is support from the press in future potential member states .
but the vote leaves questions about the image of the eu and the integration process .
europe 's collective sigh of relief le figaro in paris says : " the irish said a clear and massive yes this weekend to the enlargement of the european union . "
" the irish chose not to punish the reformed states of central and eastern europe again for the rather badly-run brussels bureaucracy . "
frankfurter allgemeine zeitung it says the result of this " last-chance referendum " on the treaty of nice " was greeted with great relief in brussels and the european union candidate countries " .
while the treaty was rejected last year in the first irish referendum on the issue , when far fewer people bothered to vote , the paper says that the " strong turnout " this time " got the better of the eurosceptics " .
it adds that the result also represents " sweet revenge " for irish prime minister bertie ahern 's government , which it says is doing very badly in the opinion polls .
" relief " is also how a headline in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung sums up reactions to the referendum .
the paper suggests that the rejection of the treaty in the previous referendum was a protest against the way the eu is run rather than a vote against enlargement .
" the irish chose not to punish the reformed states of central and eastern europe again for the rather badly-run brussels bureaucracy , " it says .
the paper believes that a second " no " would no doubt have thrown the eu off course .
" the irish ' yes ' must be an incentive for everybody to devise a better eu in the reform convention , " it concludes .
the madrid daily el pais says , without naming any names , that : " the eu has breathed a sigh of relief - which is insincere on the part of some . "
" but conducting successive referendums when the first one goes wrong does not help democracy , nor does it improve the image of a european integration that is often incomprehensible to the majority of citizens , " it argues .
" what has happened highlights the need to find other formulae which make it possible to reform the eu 's basic texts without , as was the case with ireland , the fate of 470 million europeans in an enlarged eu depending so much on the opinion of a country of four million inhabitants , " the paper adds .
scars remain in germany , the frankfurter rundschau says the referendum leaves " a bad taste in the mouth " . "
referenda show subliminal opposition to eu integration . "
austria 's die presse " thus one is entitled to ask hypothetically whether or not the fifteen would have pushed through their project quite in the same way if for example a big member state , rather than little ireland , had blocked the ratification process , " it says .
the paper believes that the irish were persuaded by " warnings and veiled threats " as well as " calls for solidarity " from candidate countries to reluctantly save the eu from what it calls " a crisis of undreamt-of proportions " .
austria 's die presse argues that ireland rather than just the eu will benefit from the yes vote .
" ireland will not become europe 's outcast and may continue to play its part , " the paper says .
but it warns that " this is not a victory for europe " because the two referenda have shown what it calls " subliminal opposition " to eu integration , which is perceived as too deep and too fast .
" the patient has recovered after a first accident , but the scars remain , " it says .
hungary for enlargement the hungarian paper nepszabadsag carries official reactions welcoming the result .
" ireland took a stand in favour of the enlargement of the european union , which is appreciated by hungary as an expression of solidarity , which is one of the community 's basic principles " , it quotes the hungarian foreign ministry as saying .
" on behalf of the hungarian people , i congratulate every irish citizen who voted responsibly " , the paper quotes the hungarian president , ferenc madl , as saying .
" the irish have got an excellent mark in the subject of responsibility .
they understood that eu enlargement , therefore the future of europe , was in their hands " , the paper quotes the foreign minister , laszlo kovacs , as saying .
irish give romania hope romania 's azi says that the vote represents an " important success for the government in dublin " .
" meanwhile , " the paper says , " the high-ranking officials in brussels are even happier because the irish vote paves the way for eu enlargement in 2004 " .
" although romania is not part of this wave of enlargement , " the paper concludes , " the government in bucharest and the population as a whole are now more hopeful that brussels will accept romania 's bid for eu entry in 2007 " .
