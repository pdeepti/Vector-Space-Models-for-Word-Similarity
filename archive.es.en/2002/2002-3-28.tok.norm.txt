but the prime minister acknowledged that many people questioned whether the £ 5bn of extra cash had actually delivered anything at all .
we want to make sure that we increase the capacity of the health service tony blair health secretary alan milburn and mr blair were explaining how the £ 49bn nhs budget for england and wales was divided up over the past year to the nhs modernisation board on wednesday .
conservative health spokesman dr liam fox said that the prime minister needed to explain why , when extra money was being poured in , there were record operation cancellations and growing waiting lists .
mr blair said : " most people working within the service can see that there are changes happening as a result of that investment which make it all the more important that we continue it . "
mr milburn explained that staff pay - which makes up 60-65 % of the budget was now running at £ 1.9bn - up just under 4 % compared with the previous year .
new staff and new drugs cost £ 1.8bn - £ 1bn of which went on new drugs .
an extra £ 50m was made available for cancer treatment equipment and £ 40m to get rid of out-dated wards .

sustained investment was needed , he added .
" that is what we have the opportunity to do in the budget , and obviously the spending review . "
wednesday 's meeting comes three weeks ahead of the government 's overall budget announcement .
the issue of health provision continues to cause difficulties for the government .
doomed to failure ?
the liberal democrats want to know what is not being done to allow increases in priority areas .
the conservatives say it is illuminating that the government feels the need to produce the figures at all .
at the tory spring conference in harrogate last week dr fox warned that labour plans to improve the nhs by pumping in extra cash were doomed to fail unless the service was overhauled .
he echoed that message on wednesday saying : " the prime minister is clearly panicking about his ability to persuade people that simply spending more money will improve the nhs .
" what the prime minister really needs to explain is why , despite the increased spending that has already taken place , we have rising waiting lists , record levels of cancelled operations , a crisis in care homes , widespread bed blocking and almost 1 in 10 patients acquiring an infection while they are in hospital .
he added : " before throwing any more taxpayers money in , the prime minister should be trying to eliminate the £ 9billion of waste that the nhs itself identified last year . "
chancellor gordon brown has said that he wants to plough a " greater share of the national income " into the health service over the next few years .
but he has struck a cautionary note by saying that there will be no new cash for public services without evidence that it is being spent well .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- prescott - ' spin doctor ' act on its way categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk politics front page world uk uk politics interviews business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 28 march , 2002 , 06:22 gmt prescott - ' spin doctor ' act on its way jo moore was at the centre of the row over spin the time is right for a civil service act that will regulate the activities of special advisers and their relationship with career civil servants , deputy prime minister john prescott has confirmed .
he said britain 's most senior civil servant sir richard wilson had made it clear that there will be a consultative document that will pave the way to future legislation .
we have accepted that the time has come - particularly now sir richard has endorsed it - that there should be a civil service act john prescott deputy prime minister sir richard wilson recommended a limit on the number of politically-appointed spin doctors through a new civil service act .
demands for such an act have escalated since the transport department spin row which saw the departures of press chief martin sixsmith and spin doctor jo moore , who suggested 11 september was a good day to bury bad news .
' interesting ideas ' sir richard , who holds the post of cabinet secretary , has been urging the government to tighten the rules to protect the impartiality of civil servants and give them a legally-enforced complaints procedure .
this would make it easier for a whistleblower to expose improper practices .
sir richard set out his ideas for reform in a private speech on tuesday .
mr prescott said : " sir richard made clear there will be a consultative document and indeed there will be .
prescott : the time has come for a civil service act .
" he gave us some interesting ideas on how we might consider , in a consultative document prior to a civil service act , how we might improve these relations .
" we are all agreed .
we have accepted that the time has come - particularly now sir richard has endorsed it - that there should be a civil service act .
" it is quite a major and fundamental change and we have to get it right . "
' teenyboppers ' he side-stepped issues surrounding the timing for the bill 's introduction to parliament .
mr prescott , who once described labour 's back-room staff as " teenyboppers " , said an act would allow mps to scrutinise a commissioner 's annual report on the state of the civil service and bring special advisers much more under their supervision .
he accepted that there were disputes about the role of special advisers .
sir richard wants to protect whitehall 's impartiality " i have had comments to make about special advisers , but ...
sir richard wilson said he thought advisers did a very good job .
he was quite warm on that .
" what he said was the problem was that sometimes the relations can vary between individuals .
" let us be clear about that relationship , let 's set it in a proper framework and adopt the government 's own policy , which is to provide a civil service act . "
measures to formalise relations between civil servants and advisers , including the special advisers ' code of conduct , model contracts and pay scales had already be formalised by the government , he said .
tim collins , shadow minister for the cabinet office , said there was now a cross-party consensus in favour of a civil service act .
legal force in his speech , sir richard argued that unless there was legislation to curb the number of special advisers and give legal force to the rules governing their conduct , the issue would continue to " fester " damaging both the government and the civil service .
and he warned that the dangers of politically impartial civil servants being drawn into the political arena were growing .
he set out a series of proposals to ensure political appointees , like ms moore , did not " undermine " the role of civil servants .
he said special advisers should : have no role in the recruitment , promotion or management of permanent civil servants not interfere in the assessment of civil servants ' performance and pay work under the direction of the minister who appointed them , who in turn must take responsibility for their actions and conduct .
sir richard said : " the basic responsibility for special advisers , for their selection and their actions , should rest with the minister who is accountable to parliament for them . "
sir richard also condemned unauthorised leaks by civil servants , which he described as " deeply corrosive " .
but , he added , there was a need for a better grievance procedure for civil servants who felt special advisers were abusing their position , in order to " reduce the temptation to leak to the press or opposition " .
sir richard stressed that he did not believe the civil service was being politicised , but he acknowledged that the conditions in which civil servants worked were changing . watch / listen on this story deputy prime minister john prescott " we will move to a civil service act " shadow cabinet office minister tim collins " there is a clear cross party consensus " key stories blair backs ' liar ' byers byers admits mistake commons showdown moore and sixsmith quit background bleak outlook for byers timeline on spin row the row explained who said what a new civil service main players jo moore martin sixsmith stephen byers sir richard mottram talking point is stephen byers right to quit ?

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- blair here to stay says prescott categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk politics front page world uk uk politics interviews business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 28 march , 2002 , 06:22 gmt blair here to stay says prescott mr blair wants labour backbenchers to trust him .
there will not be a leadership challenge to tony blair , deputy prime minister john prescott has insisted .
but he admitted there was a growing raft of concern among labour backbenches about the government 's direction on key issues such as the prospect of war with iraq and reform of public services .
i think i want tony blair to allow a debate to happen on these key policy issues - whether he comes or goes is up to him john mcdonnell labour mp mr prescott was commenting after mr blair made a passionate appeal to labour 's left to trust his plans for change .
mr blair told labour 's ruling national executive committee on tuesday that the conservative party would be the sole beneficiaries if the party failed to unite behind him .
tearoom chat a number of mps from the labour backbenches and in the cabinet have expressed their disquiet about potential military action against iraq and public service reform .
there has even been reported talk around the commons tearooms of a possible challenge to tony blair 's leadership .
nobody is suggesting that tony blair would be changed as leader john prescott deputy prime minister but mr prescott insisted : " i 'll give you my judgement - i think this government is doing a good job .
" nobody is suggesting that tony blair would be changed as leader .
" if they did , there is a process for that .
nobody is going to exercise that .
" we have got to recognise that in this stage of government , of its second term , we may have some difficulties and exchanges , but we have to work at that . "
but mr prescott conceded : " there are real sensitivities about speculation about iraq , about the implementation of public services , the role of public / private money - these are legitimate concerns but yet again we discussed that in the executive yesterday . "
one-track mind " of course there is concern - i do n't want to dismiss that .
they come up to me and they talk about some of these things and we have got to work at it .
" but tony blair is a guy , let 's face it , who does get into the debate whatever is said about that . "
mr prescott told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " what some mean is that he does n't change his mind on his position , like they do n't change they mind on their 's . "
however , labour 's john mcdonnell , chairman of the socialist campaign group , warned that the party could lose the next election if it continued to adopt tory policies .
mcdonnell : labour will lose election if it continues with tory policies .
he argued that the labour leadership was separating away from backbenchers on iraq and public service reform and called for a party debate on the division .
" on peace , we as a party always had a preference to peace rather than a leap to war - that has not been displayed on iraq , " he told today .
" as a party , we have always supported public services , not privatisation .
tony 's style " what won us the election was the rejection of tory policies - some of which this government is now taking up , like privatisation - and they will lose us the election in the same way they lost the tories the election if we are not very , very careful . "
the hayes and harlington mp , stressed : " it is not a matter about individuals , to be honest . "
he added : " i think i want tony blair to allow a debate to happen on these key policy issues - whether he comes or goes is up to him . "
but mr prescott retorted : " john mcdonnell , when he was a councillor he split with the london council ; when he was in ken livingstone 's cabinet , he split with them ; when he is in the parliamentary labour party , he splits with them . "

the british medical association said the disparity has been caused by the scottish executive 's refusal to subsidise those taking the course south of the border .
according to bma news , scotland is the only part of the uk to deny students the funding .
however , the scottish executive said only a handful of students would be affected .
the fast-track scheme is part of the uk government 's plans to increase the number of medical students .
those from england , wales and northern ireland are eligible for special nhs bursaries for the final three years of the four-year courses .
this entitles them to a 100 % student loan in their first year , followed by a 50 % loan and a means-tested bursary in the following three years .
the students only pay tuition fees in the first year of the course .
the health department also pays the fees for all students who hail from european union countries outside the uk .
however , scottish students must pay full tuition fees and are only entitled to the full loan in the first year .
similar courses fast-track courses are not yet available outwith england .
one student said the position was unreasonable , adding : " it will not help the nhs medical staffing issues . "
the scottish executive said that only a handful of students were affected .
it said it was sympathetic to the situation and that it would be providing funding for similar courses when they are introduced in scotland .
however , bma news said it had been told by an executive spokesman that no decision had yet been made on the introduction of equivalent degrees in scotland - and was not expected for some time .

" he was the most charming of men and delightful company , a superb musician , a bloody good comedian , " he said .
" but he did n't seem to understand what he had got .
he was the opposite of the cocksure entertainer .
" he had a little boy lost quality about him , which women loved , and there was always something slightly forlorn about dudley , even when he was being funny . "

" he was hilariously funny and yet at the same time very sensitive , " the actress said .
" dudley was a brilliant musician and composer .
music was his first passion , " she said , adding that he could have lived happily " without ever acting or telling jokes again . "
jazz singer dame cleo laine , who knew moore for almost 40 years , said : " in lots of ways it 's a release for him .
" he had to be fed and washed and looked after like a baby . "
she spoke of his humour , adding : " i remember him as somebody who could make you laugh , he was very easy going he just loved people and was very warm . "
film director michael winner said it was an " immensely sad day " , and that " he was the most likeable man i ever met " .
" everybody loves the little fellow who makes good , " he said .
" his talent was special because the minute you saw him your heart went out to him and you were rooting for him . "

and dr miller said his comedy work with peter cook would survive him , adding : " that 's the most memorable thing - the most original stuff was what he did with peter . "

we will miss him . "
film critic barry norman described moore as " a very nice bloke " with a " tremendous personality " .
but he added : " he probably had n't fulfilled all his talent and promise in all the areas in which he had talent and promise .
" his comedy , music and acting - he never quite did enough . "
moore 's long-time agent and friend , lou pitt , added : " his humour , his joy and his passion to make people laugh will be sorely and deeply missed . "

the cape is widely regarded as one of the finest pieces of bronze age craftsmanship in the world .
the final pieces of the delicate 4,000-year-old cape were recently pieced together , helping historians envisage how it would have looked .
it will star alongside other priceless artefacts from round the world , including the montrastruc spear thrower , from garonne , france , and the sintra gold collar , from portugal , dating from 900-700 bc .

historians believe it was possibly worn as a garment for religious ceremonies by someone of great authority .

the cape was discovered in pieces in a grave with the bones of a man at bryn yr ellyllon -lrb- the fairies ' or goblins ' hill -rrb- , in mold , north wales , in 1833 .
the british museum came into possession of many of the pieces in 1836 , but it was years later before the remaining fragments were discovered .

megawati , daughter of indonesia 's founding president sukarno , will meet kim jong-il , son of north korea 's founder , kim il-sung .
she is expected to press kim jong-il to resume talks with south korea after a four-month break in contacts , partly prompted by us president george bush 's branding of the north as part of an " axis of evil " .
korean contacts on hold visit of north korean leader to south reunions of divided families reopening of rail and road links closer economic ties the talks come ahead of a key visit to pyongyang next week by a south korean envoy , lim dong-won .
south korea hopes mr lim 's four-day stay will help renew a stalled dialogue and reduce tension on the peninsula ahead of the football world cup , which the south is co-hosting .
us talks south korea 's president kim dae-jung has said talks between the two koreas was " essential " , not just for the countries themselves but also for improving us and japanese relations with the communist north .
in another sign of diplomatic progress , japan 's health minister is expected to meet his north korean counterpart in singapore this weekend .
north korean officials are also reported to have met us officials in new york earlier this month .
megawati 's visit coincides with a rare session of north korea 's parliament .
premier hong song-nam told the supreme people 's assembly that the country needed to open up its economy , which analysts say is one of the world 's least developed .
" it is necessary to improve trade and economic cooperation and widely conduct joint ventures and collaboration with different countries and international organisations , " the official news agency kcna quoted him as saying .
' land of bliss ' north korea 's parliament known as supreme people 's assembly 687 members meets just once or twice a year kim jong-il attended last year 's one day session kcna said the parliament had passed a new land use law which had helped turn rural areas " into a socialist land of bliss " .
after her 48-hour trip to the north , megawati is due to visit the south 's capital , seoul .
north korea is also preparing to welcome tourists from south korea and japan next month for its arirang festival and for other celebrations to mark the 90th birthday anniversary of the late kim il-sung .
the two koreas remain technically at war as they did not sign a peace treaty at the end of the 1950-53 conflict .

the bid , which could create thousands of jobs for the area , has involved work from organisations across the whole of wales .
it is hoped it will raise the profile of wales in europe , and encourage long term social , economic and cultural development .
the proposal was delivered to the department of culture , media and sport in london .
the european council awards the title of european capital of culture to a different city every year .
in 2008 , it is the uk 's turn to compete for the accolade .
the award is designed to encourage cities to develop their cultural heritage , and is used to promote a greater awareness of the area 's main attractions and traditions .
rivals for the title include bradford , birmingham , norwich , edinburgh , liverpool , inverness , newcastle and gateshead and milton keynes .
the last british city to win the title was glasgow in 1990 .
jobs created cardiff 's bid is jointly funded by the council and the welsh assembly .
cardiff will learn in the autumn if it has been shortlisted , with the eventual winner being named in spring 2003 .
putting together the bid has been far from plain sailing .
in may last year , those reponsibile came under fire from the council 's very own consultants .
in a report obtained by bbc wales , mccann , matthews , millman highlighted a number of serious weaknesses in the city 's cultural life , including the lack of a modern welsh art gallery .
on top of that they criticised the absence of a cultural strategy and said cardiff was late planning its bid , compared to its competitors .
citing the example of glasgow , cardiff chamber of commerce said the city stands to substantially benefit economically and socially .
cardiff lord mayor russell goodway said the bid will be " an opportunity to showcase the whole of wales through its vibrant capital city " .

the naha district court ruled that staff sergeant timothy woodland , 25 , raped the 24-year-old japanese woman in a car park at a shopping complex near the kadena air base .
woodland had admitted having sex with the woman , but said it had been consensual .
the case aroused controversy because the us military took four days to hand woodland over to the japanese police , arguing that it needed guarantees he would be given fair treatment .
there are 50,000 us troops based in japan , half of those in okinawa .
jail term the jail term was slightly shorter than the three years which prosecutors had sought .
lawyers said three years for rape was the norm in japanese courts , adding that under japanese criminal law , two years in prison is the minimum for rape , and that it is rare for the sentences to be over five years .
woodland initially stood motionless as the sentence was read out , but then asked to sit down , after appearing to feel faint .
the trial , which began last september , heard the alleged rape victim say she was too scared to cry for help at the time of the incident .
she said she had given no sign she would consent to sex , and described such suggestions as " outrageous " .
the incident was the latest in a series which provoked local resentment of the us military presence on the southern japanese island .
in 1995 three servicemen raped a 12-year-old okinawan girl , leading to massive protests .

the expectations follow a landmark decision by one of the uk 's largest financial institutions to compensate some staff .
hsbc is to spend about £ 25m backdating pensions of part-time staff in line with full-time employees , who have worked for the bank since 1976 .
the payouts , will affect up to 3,500 staff and follows a house of lords ruling last year which clarified an earlier court decision to compensate some part-time workers for lost pensions .
the decision by hsbc is expected to have implications for other part-time workers , especially those in the public sector , where tens of thousands of workers have already filed similar claims .
part-time rights since the early 1990s , part-time employees have been trying to gain the same rights as full-time workers to pensions .
following a batch of six european court of justice cases in september 1994 - known as the " six pack " - tens of thousands of claims were presented in the employment tribunals in the uk on behalf of part-time employees .
they wanted to gain access to occupational pension schemes dating back to april 1976 .
it took until the beginning of last year to get clarification , as the case was shuffled between the house of lords and the european court of justice .
in february , the house of lords decided : claims had to be brought during employment or within six months after the end of employment .
access to the pension scheme could be back-dated to the date on which employment started or april 1976 .
can of worms those hsbc workers who will benefit from the ruling fits within the parameters of the house of lords ' decision .
but , hsbc said that there could be others who are affected , and may come within the settlement .
such a lengthy legal process - seven years - is likely to warn off other organisations and companies - and some are expected to offer similar compensation following hsbc 's decision to settle claims .
for example , there are already 60,000 claims lodged from part-time workers , two-thirds of whom are public sector workers .
this legal ruling , however , is unlikely to conclude the matter of part-time rights to pensions .
while many part-time staff now get the same benefits as full-time employees , and the house of lords as a test case gives some rights to backdate payments , it is unlikely to be the end of the matter .
people who left hsbc and did not claim within six months of leaving will not qualify .
a source close to hsbc said that there were likely to be subsequent claims from those who were not covered by the house of lords ruling .
