tom hanks , director sam mendes and his partner kate winslet were among those attending the screening of road to perdition , mendes ' first film since the oscar-winning american beauty .
director sam mendes was supported by partner kate winslet hanks , who stars as a gangster , received a loud welcome from the crowd of more than 2,000 people outside the empire cinema in london 's leicester square .
the american actor said : " it is intimidating , i must say .
" you step out of the car and it is a wall of sound from all those people .
you do n't ever get used to it . "
in praising mendes ' talents as a director , he said : " his language of film is extraordinary . "
darker role winslet wore a black evening gown from dolce & gabanna and mendes dressed in a black suit and white shirt .
mendes said he would love to work with the actress but added " nothing is planned at the moment " .
other premiere guests included actor michael gambon , television presenter ruby wax and big brother 's alex sibley .
jude law is a surprising choice as hitman harlen the film has divided critics elsewhere - attracting both extravagant praise and strong criticism .
hanks plays against type by portraying a bad guy for the first time in his career .
two-time oscar-winning hanks has said he was not worried what movie-goers might think of his darker role - at odds with his received image as america 's beloved cinematic everyman .
he plays michael sullivan , the loyal enforcer for a mob boss and surrogate father-figure who is portrayed by 73-year-old screen veteran paul newman .
ruby wax was among the guests but the film focuses on the relationship between hanks 's character and one of his young sons whose eyes are opened to a disturbing reality when he first witnesses his father killing another man .
for most of the film sullivan is on the road with his young son trying to avoid a menacing hit man , played by jude law , who doubles as a crime photographer .
but road to perdition is also a tale of redemption , with hanks 's character doing everything he can to make sure his son does not follow him into a life of violence .
sam mendes , 37 , is seen as one of the uk 's top directors - though so far his major work has been done in the us .
among his awards are an oscar and the david lean bafta award for direction , for 2000 's american beauty . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's robert nisbet " tom hanks said he took the role because of sam mendes " perdition premiere see also : 18 sep 02 -pipe- entertainment road to perdition : your views 18 sep 02 -pipe- breakfast another oscar for mendes ? 18 sep 02 -pipe- entertainment hanks overcomes road rage 10 jul 02 -pipe- entertainment tom hanks braves bad reaction 27 apr 01 -pipe- entertainment tom hanks is ' most influential actor ' 19 nov 01 -pipe- entertainment mendes ' midas touch internet links : road to perdition sam mendes interview - bbc films online tom hanks interview - bbc films online the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top entertainment stories now : fans await beatles ' jam ' footage afghans repair broken heritage mona lisa smile secrets revealed gallery unveils titian show spice girls dismiss comeback plan hello ! executive denies ' court plot ' star wars strikes $ 15m tv deal tv 's joe millionaire picks his lady links to more entertainment stories are at the foot of the page .

exactly how tough has been spelt out in a damning report by the audit commission on dental care in england and wales .
it says 40 per cent of dental practices no longer take nhs patients - and , when they do , millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money is being wasted on uneccessary treatment , such as scaling and polishing teeth .
on breakfast this morning , we put those points to the boss of the british dental association , anthony kravitz the audit commission is calling for urgent reform of dental care .
it says , while people can usually access emergency dental care through nhs direct , continuing care for adults and children is far harder to find .
in some areas , no dentists will accept adult nhs patients onto their lists . "
we do n't need more reports , we need action " john renshaw british dental association the commission 's report says the problems are rooted in the system rather than with the dentists themselves , who feel they are on an nhs " treadmill " - overworked and underpaid .
some move into private practice , sometimes leaving communities with no nhs dental provision .
on average , dentists estimate 15 % of their patients are private , but in the south east that figure can be as high as 50 % .
and the audit commission warns the piecework system , under which dentists are paid per item of treatment provided , means there is a " perverse incentive " for unnecessary or cosmetic work .
for example , scaling and polishing teeth is a common procedure which accounts for 11 % of nhs family dentist spending .
temporary benefit but for most people , it is of temporary cosmetic benefit and rarely prevents or cures gum disease , the commission warns .
the patient pays 80 % of the cost of nhs treatment , with the health service footing the rest of the bill .
in total , the nhs spends around £ 1.6bn each year on dental services .
the audit commission has said the check-up system , which requires people to come in every six months , also needs to be reformed .
experts say because dental health has improved , in most cases a check-up every two to three years for adults and one to two years for children , is enough to pick up dental health problems .
unnecessary check-ups but dentists are not paid a fee for nhs patients who have not attended for 15 months , and they are dropped from the register .
the audit commission says these rules also lead to huge numbers of unnecessary check-ups , costing the nhs at least £ 150m in england and £ 8m in wales each year .
but despite the overall improvements in dental health , people in deprived areas are seeing significant problems , with children 's tooth decay levels as high as they were 15 years ago . "
we recognise that there is still more to do " department of health spokesman the audit commission says many of the problems with nhs dental health services have been addressed by the government in its recent report " options for change " .
the commission is calling for several measures to revamp the system , including better information for patients about how to maintain dental health and how to ensure they receive the right treatments .
sir andrew foster , the controller of the audit commission , said the current nhs dental care system did not provide the right incentives to ensure equal access for all .
he said : " it needs to be changed , to become more flexible , and more focused on the needs of individual people . "
postcode lottery " we all need access to continuing , preventative dental care .
dentists and nhs bodies must work together to empower patients and encourage them to take an active role in maintaining their dental health . "
the chairman of the british dental association 's executive board , john renshaw , backed the report 's findings , but said : " we do n't need more reports , we need action , through changes which are properly thought out and properly funded . "
sheila mckechnie , director of the consumers ' association , which has looked at the problems in nhs dental care in the past , said finding the problems people in many areas had finding an nhs dentist was " another example of our health postcode lottery " .
but a department of health spokesman said a lot of work was being done to improve nhs dental services and that there would be examinations of the check-up system and the benefits of water fluoridation .

a pinch of enthusiasm , a dose of ambition and a hefty dollop of hard work sounds like a recipe for the perfect entrepreneur .
perween warsi has all three , plus the sort of matriarchal steel necessary to thrive in the cut-throat world of mass-market catering .
as a young mother in the 1980s she dreamt about running a big business .
our products got the thumbs-up and it was the best day of my business life perween warsi over 15 years later , mrs warsi has built up a food manufacturer supplying ready-made meals to uk supermarkets and pubs , as well as exporting to europe .
the company - named s & a foods after her two sons sadiq and abid - turns over about £ 100m a year and employs 1,400 people in four factories in the north of england .
" as a young woman , i always had aspirations and a desire to achieve something on my own , " she recalls .
" from childhood i had seen the importance of food , of having fresh ingredients and creating fantastic flavours .
" i got it from my grandmother and my mother .
food is in my blood . "
from the kitchen to the factory company legend has it that mrs warsi set up her business after becoming fed up with the quality of indian foods in british supermarkets .
the company launches 300 new products a year from modest beginnings in her own kitchen - " to test the market " - mrs warsi quickly established herself as a manufacturer .
" from day one , my aim was to have products on supermarket shelves nationally , " she says .
determination matched her ambition - day after day she would beg the supermarkets to trial her food .
after six months , asda finally agreed to a blind tasting of mrs warsi 's foods alongside other samples .
" our products got the thumbs-up and it was the best day of my business life .
" it was absolutely fantastic - it was what i wanted so desperately and believed in . "
investment in 1987 , with the aim of finding more money to invest in the business , s & a foods joined the hughes food group .
perween warsi born in india in 1956 married to dr talib warsi in 1973 has two sons sadiq -lrb- 26 -rrb- and abid -lrb- 24 -rrb- starts s & a foods in 1986 sells to hughes food in 1987 regains control in 1991 builds new £ 8m factory in 1996 receives mbe in 1997 and cbe in 2002 clients include asda , safeway , waitrose and sainsbury 's three years later saw the warsi family fighting to regain control after hughes food went belly-up .
after a successful management buyout , mrs warsi began diversifying into thai , malaysian , chinese and american food .
but the loss of control has not gone forgotten - mrs warsi plans to " keep the business in the family " rather risk a float on the stock market .
she says her secret ingredient has been a investment in product development .
the company launches 300 food products a year and is constantly experimenting in its test kitchen .

a pinch of enthusiasm , a dose of ambition and a hefty dollop of hard work sounds like a recipe for the perfect entrepreneur .
perween warsi has all three , plus the sort of matriarchal steel necessary to thrive in the cut-throat world of mass-market catering .
as a young mother in the 1980s she dreamt about running a big business . "
our products got the thumbs-up and it was the best day of my business life " perween warsi over 15 years later , mrs warsi has built up a food manufacturer supplying ready-made meals to uk supermarkets and pubs , as well as exporting to europe .
the company - named s & a foods after her two sons sadiq and abid - turns over about £ 100m a year and employs 1,400 people in four factories in the north of england .
" as a young woman , i always had aspirations and a desire to achieve something on my own , " she recalls .
" from childhood i had seen the importance of food , of having fresh ingredients and creating fantastic flavours .
" i got it from my grandmother and my mother .
food is in my blood . "
from the kitchen to the factory company legend has it that mrs warsi set up her business after becoming fed up with the quality of indian foods in british supermarkets .
from modest beginnings in her own kitchen - " to test the market " - mrs warsi quickly established herself as a manufacturer .
" from day one , my aim was to have products on supermarket shelves nationally , " she says .
determination matched her ambition - day after day she would beg the supermarkets to trial her food .
after six months , asda finally agreed to a blind tasting of mrs warsi 's foods alongside other samples .
" our products got the thumbs-up and it was the best day of my business life .
" it was absolutely fantastic - it was what i wanted so desperately and believed in . "
investment in 1987 , with the aim of finding more money to invest in the business , s & a foods joined the hughes food group .
perween warsi born in india in 1956 married to dr talib warsi in 1973 has two sons sadiq -lrb- 26 -rrb- and abid -lrb- 24 -rrb- starts s & a foods in 1986 sells to hughes food in 1987 regains control in 1991 builds new £ 8m factory in 1996 receives mbe in 1997 and cbe in 2002 clients include asda , safeway , waitrose and sainsbury 's three years later saw the warsi family fighting to regain control after hughes food went belly-up .
after a successful management buyout , mrs warsi began diversifying into thai , malaysian , chinese and american food .
but the loss of control has not gone forgotten - mrs warsi plans to " keep the business in the family " rather risk a float on the stock market .
she says her secret ingredient has been a investment in product development .
the company launches 300 food products a year and is constantly experimenting in its test kitchen .
" it is everyone 's responsibility to come up with new ideas - it can be in design , packaging or processing . "

president george w bush has made it clear he wants a regime change , and no one expects saddam hussein to bow out voluntarily .

but here is a possible scenario .
before president bush gives any obvious green light , special forces are dropped into iraq to locate scud ballistic missiles and as many chemical and biological weapons as possible .
" they 've got to get into the ' scud box ' to stop saddam launching the missiles against israel , " one former special operations commander , colonel tim eades , told bbc online .
the " scud box " is the area of western iraq from where a scud could reach israel .
israeli prime minister ariel sharon has said any attack on his country would meet with massive retaliation , and america is determined not to let " regime change " spill into a wider middle east war .
lessons learnt the next stage is that a large pre-positioning force of at least 50,000 troops moves as close as possible to iraq .
they will travel , mainly by ship , to kuwait , qatar and possibly saudi arabia , accompanied by their heavy armour .
units such as the 10th mountain division , the 101st airborne division and the 2nd marine expeditionary force are likely to be at the forefront .
while they are getting into place , a rolling air campaign begins .
like the gulf war , this will try to sever the iraqi military 's command and control , cutting saddam hussein off from his commanders in the field .
this time it will be harder .
the iraqi leader learnt from the gulf war not to station his forces in the open desert where they can be picked off from the air .
so he will keep his toughest , best equipped units close to hand around the two strategic areas of baghdad and basra , hidden amongst the civilian population .
the third stage is what is known as the " inside out " option , where 10-20,000 airborne troops head straight to baghdad to decapitate the iraqi regime .
messy fight ?
how easy this will be remains a matter of fierce debate .
will saddam hussein unleash his chemical weapons or could he be persuaded not to by the offer of some kind of asylum outside iraq ?
how quickly will the iraqi units crumble ?
michael o 'hanlon , defence analyst at the brookings institution , says : " having thousands of american troops and tanks in reserve on iraq 's borders would put tremendous psychological pressure on the regime .
it 'll get the message that it can not win . "
optimistic military planners hope for a quick operation with under 1,000 us casualties .
but if we start seeing lines of american tanks streaming across the desert , as we did in desert storm , then we will know that the " inside out " option has not worked and that they are having to call in the heavy boys .
no one thinks america will lose .
and the us military seems to be confident that it can run this at the same time as the rest of its war on terrorism .
but the fighting could be messy .

the audit commission publication paints a damning picture of dental care in wales , where just 45 % of adults are registered .
it is critical of regulations paying dentists for each treatment , which leads to too-frequent check-up and other appointments , costing £ 8m each year .
dental facts uk dentists paid per treatment encourages needless visits £ 8m wasted in wales on needless treatment £ 3.5m wasted on cosmetic appointments 55 % of adults have no dentist dentists ' salary called for to solve problem wales already has the worst child tooth decay record in the uk .
many people are worried about dental costs .
the report from the commission criticises the " treadmill " system in which the nhs pays uk dentists £ 1.6bn annually , on a treatment-by-treatment basis - a " perverse incentive " ripe for exploitation .
" many dentists feel under pressure to work increasingly hard and quickly , possibly compromising quality , in order to keep their businesses afloat , " it said .
it means polishing and other cosmetic work , which has little health benefit , accounts for 11 % of dentists ' time and £ 3.5m.
that system was developed in the 1940s , when dental health was worse .
the audit commission suggests paying dentists proper salaries and ensuring appointments are no more regular than two or three years for adults , instead of six months , would correct the problem .
care access problem but the report also warns about access to any dental services at all .
" this pressure on dentists means that some leave the nhs for private practice , " the report says .
" a small town can be left without nhs dental care if the main practitioner goes private . "
and the commission calls for a review of dental charges so that low-income families are not deterred from seeking legitimate treatment .
audit commission controller sir andrew foster said : " since the creation of the nhs , we have seen a great improvement in people 's dental health .
" but today 's system does not provide the right incentives to ensure that the remaining pockets of poor health are tackled , or to provide equitable access .
" it needs to be changed , to become more flexible , and more focused on the needs of individual people . "
the welsh assembly 's own dental strategy will be published in the coming months .
the british medical association watchdog wants the body to put fluoride in water supplies to stop tooth decay .

the audit commission publication paints a damning picture of dental care in wales , where just 45 % of adults are registered .
it is critical of regulations paying dentists for each treatment , which leads to too-frequent check-up and other appointments , costing £ 8m each year .
dental facts uk dentists paid per treatment encourages needless visits £ 8m wasted in wales on needless treatment £ 3.5m wasted on cosmetic appointments 55 % of adults have no dentist dentists ' salary called for to solve problem wales already has the worst child tooth decay record in the uk .
many people are worried about dental costs .
the report from the commission criticises the " treadmill " system in which the nhs pays uk dentists £ 1.6bn annually , on a treatment-by-treatment basis - a " perverse incentive " ripe for exploitation .
" many dentists feel under pressure to work increasingly hard and quickly , possibly compromising quality , in order to keep their businesses afloat , " it said .
it means polishing and other cosmetic work , which has little health benefit , accounts for 11 % of dentists ' time and £ 3.5m.
that system was developed in the 1940s , when dental health was worse .
the audit commission suggests paying dentists proper salaries and ensuring appointments are no more regular than two or three years for adults , instead of six months , would correct the problem .
care access problem but the report also warns about access to any dental services at all .
" this pressure on dentists means that some leave the nhs for private practice , " the report says .
privatisation leaves some areas without dentists " a small town can be left without nhs dental care if the main practitioner goes private . "
and the commission calls for a review of dental charges so that low-income families are not deterred from seeking legitimate treatment .
audit commission controller sir andrew foster said : " since the creation of the nhs , we have seen a great improvement in people 's dental health .
" but today 's system does not provide the right incentives to ensure that the remaining pockets of poor health are tackled , or to provide equitable access .
" it needs to be changed , to become more flexible , and more focused on the needs of individual people . "
the welsh assembly 's own dental strategy will be published in the coming months .
the british medical association watchdog wants the body to put fluoride in water supplies to stop tooth decay .

large shopping centres and freshly renovated 19th century buildings line wide boulevards , thanks in part to the enormous sums that have flowed into the east from the west since the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
holger fiedler may not work again but you do n't even have to scratch at the surface to notice that something is odd here .
the place feels empty .
because there is no work .
one in five are unemployed here , and many young people have left .
they have gone west , taking their talents where they can be used and draining the region of its brightest and best .
click here to see august unemployment rates former conservative chancellor helmut kohl promised easterners " flourishing landscapes " .
outgoing social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder said getting the east on its feet was top of his list .
the people here have seen both the conservatives and the social democrats at the helm , and neither has delivered .
in the last elections of 1998 , mr kohl was punished for his failure .
mr schroeder is waiting to see whether he will suffer the same fate .
race for votes the eastern states , with their declining population , make up only a fifth of the german electorate .
but they are volatile voters , lacking traditional loyalties to the western parties .
read clare murphy 's campaign reports apathetic youth bavaria factor immigrant vote on friday , clare murphy reports from hanover on the women 's vote with mr schroeder 's social democrats neck-and-neck in the opinion polls with the conservative coalition led by bavarian leader edmund stoiber ahead of sunday 's general election , the race is on to conquer the east , and pick up what could prove to be the winning votes .
under mr schroeder 's government , eastern unemployment hit the 1.4 million mark - its highest since 1990 , just after the berlin wall fell .
it is double the rate in western germany .
the region languishes behind the west on economic growth , productivity and living standards .
mr stoiber , pointing to his economic successes in bavaria , promises to change all that .
he has named as his eastern affairs minister lothar spaeth , head of jenoptik , the high technology group that is one of the east 's success stories .
his programme promises more money , less bureaucracy , more jobs .
" i do n't believe in it any more .
i do n't really blame schroeder for failing to fix things here , i just do n't think stoiber will be able to do it either , " says holger fiedler , an unemployed electrician in his fifties who has not had a permanent job for eight years .
" it 's hard not to feel nostalgic about the time when we all had work , before the wall fell , " he says .
" i do n't believe i 'll ever have a proper job again . "
stoiber under fire saxony-anhalt has already delivered mr schroeder a major blow this year , ejecting his social democrats from the regional parliament and replacing them with a coalition of the local branch of the conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the neo-liberal free democrats .
charlotte franz is no stoiber fan but mr stoiber , leading a coalition of the cdu and his own conservative bavarian party , the csu , into next sunday 's general election does not seem popular here .
his aides have even taken to carrying umbrellas after mr stoiber was pelted with eggs at an eastern rally .
his unpopularity appears to stem in part from his infamous opposition a series of large subsidies to the east in the past , as well as the fact he ousted easterner angela merkel as the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellory earlier this year .
and he totally failed to pick up any points when this region was hit by catastrophic flooding just a few weeks ago .
mr stoiber was on holiday while mr schroeder was pulling on his wellingtons and embarking on a tour of devastated towns and villages .
and when mr stoiber finally did arrive at the scene , he was simply unable to compete with the personable chancellor .
" stoiber looked terrible next to schroeder , " says charlotte franz , a teacher .
" he was totally wooden . "
" it 's not been the only thing that 's made me decide to vote spd on sunday , but it has played a role .
schroeder has n't achieved much here , but i do n't believe stoiber would either .
so i 'm opting for the more likeable of the two . "
former communists mr fiedler , however , wo n't be voting on sunday , along with several others i met in magdeburg today .
many here who turned out in full force after the fall of the wall for their first taste of democracy have already lost their faith in the politicians .
the post-communist party of democratic socialism , which may not make the 5 % needed to enter parliament , is hoping to pick up at least a few votes from those fed up with the failures of the western parties .
" i 'll either not vote , or i 'll vote pds , " says julia bock , an artist .
" i 'm not wild about them , but i 'd like them to be in parliament . "
mr schroeder has ruled out any coalition with the pds .

large shopping centres and freshly renovated 19th century buildings line wide boulevards , thanks in part to the enormous sums that have flowed into the east from the west since the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
but you do n't even have to scratch at the surface to notice that something is odd here .
the place feels empty .
because there is no work .
one in five are unemployed here , and many young people have left .
they have gone west , taking their talents where they can be used and draining the region of its brightest and best .
click here to see august unemployment rates former conservative chancellor helmut kohl promised easterners " flourishing landscapes " .
outgoing social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder said getting the east on its feet was top of his list .
the people here have seen both the conservatives and the social democrats at the helm , and neither has delivered .
in the last elections of 1998 , mr kohl was punished for his failure .
mr schroeder is waiting to see whether he will suffer the same fate .
race for votes the eastern states , with their declining population , make up only a fifth of the german electorate .
but they are volatile voters , lacking traditional loyalties to the western parties .
read clare murphy 's campaign reports on friday , clare murphy reports from hanover on the women 's vote with mr schroeder 's social democrats neck-and-neck in the opinion polls with the conservative coalition led by bavarian leader edmund stoiber ahead of sunday 's general election , the race is on to conquer the east , and pick up what could prove to be the winning votes .
under mr schroeder 's government , eastern unemployment hit the 1.4 million mark - its highest since 1990 , just after the berlin wall fell .
it is double the rate in western germany .
the region languishes behind the west on economic growth , productivity and living standards .
mr stoiber , pointing to his economic successes in bavaria , promises to change all that .
he has named as his eastern affairs minister lothar spaeth , head of jenoptik , the high technology group that is one of the east 's success stories .
his programme promises more money , less bureaucracy , more jobs .
" i do n't believe in it any more .
i do n't really blame schroeder for failing to fix things here , i just do n't think stoiber will be able to do it either , " says holger fiedler , an unemployed electrician in his fifties who has not had a permanent job for eight years .
" it 's hard not to feel nostalgic about the time when we all had work , before the wall fell , " he says .
" i do n't believe i 'll ever have a proper job again . "
stoiber under fire saxony-anhalt has already delivered mr schroeder a major blow this year , ejecting his social democrats from the regional parliament and replacing them with a coalition of the local branch of the conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the neo-liberal free democrats .
but mr stoiber , leading a coalition of the cdu and his own conservative bavarian party , the csu , into next sunday 's general election does not seem popular here .
his aides have even taken to carrying umbrellas after mr stoiber was pelted with eggs at an eastern rally .
his unpopularity appears to stem in part from his infamous opposition a series of large subsidies to the east in the past , as well as the fact he ousted easterner angela merkel as the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellory earlier this year .
and he totally failed to pick up any points when this region was hit by catastrophic flooding just a few weeks ago .
mr stoiber was on holiday while mr schroeder was pulling on his wellingtons and embarking on a tour of devastated towns and villages .
and when mr stoiber finally did arrive at the scene , he was simply unable to compete with the personable chancellor .
" stoiber looked terrible next to schroeder , " says charlotte franz , a teacher .
" he was totally wooden . "
" it 's not been the only thing that 's made me decide to vote spd on sunday , but it has played a role .
schroeder has n't achieved much here , but i do n't believe stoiber would either .
so i 'm opting for the more likeable of the two . "
former communists mr fiedler , however , wo n't be voting on sunday , along with several others i met in magdeburg today .
many here who turned out in full force after the fall of the wall for their first taste of democracy have already lost their faith in the politicians .
the post-communist party of democratic socialism , which may not make the 5 % needed to enter parliament , is hoping to pick up at least a few votes from those fed up with the failures of the western parties .
" i 'll either not vote , or i 'll vote pds , " says julia bock , an artist .
" i 'm not wild about them , but i 'd like them to be in parliament . "
mr schroeder has ruled out any coalition with the pds .
but if they do make it into the house , it could prove to be their support that gives mr schroeder the viable working majority he needs to have another stab at government .

it is not known where the mines lie dignitaries watched as about 100 south korean soldiers , some armed , others carrying demining gear , marched through a previously locked barbed wire gate into the treacherous buffer zone .
south korean officials said a similar event was taking place in the north .
the work is aimed at clearing two 250-metre -lrb- 277-yard -rrb- corridors through the border so that road and rail links can be reconnected for the first time since the korean war half a century ago .
peppered with mines the work follows spectacular ceremonies on both sides of the border on wednesday to mark the resumption of the work , which was agreed to two years ago , but has been heavily delayed .
it is just the latest in a series of acts of reconciliation between the rival neighbours , which are still formally at war .

three powerful unions are planning to table motions calling for a moratorium on any further private sector investment in public services .
the government is relentlessly pursuing a policy that wastes money dave prentis unison the leader of the tuc 's largest union , unison , told bbc radio 4 's today programme that the private finance initiative was a waste of time and money .
unison general secretary dave prentis said : " the government is relentlessly pursuing a policy that wastes money , wastes time and fails any objective test of value for money .
we will resist the policy of depriving public projects of private finance gordon brown " it is a policy that is squandering the only chance in a generation of renewing our public services .
" it can not be right that during a period of unprecedented public investment , huge profits are going into private pockets when these funds should be directed at essential public services . "
no u-turn the government is determined to press ahead with its private finance initiative , which it believes will allow hospitals and schools to be built faster - and for less public cash upfront - than the existing system .
gordon brown told the bbc that any delay was unacceptable .
he said that it was " completely unacceptable to put a moratorium on hospitals , schools , roads and rail projects , denying the public services they need and holding back the biggest investment programme the country has ever embarked on " .
" we will resist the policy of depriving public projects of private finance where necessary .
and we will resist the idea that we should return to reckless borrowing , " he added .
spreading fast the government 's private finance plans are growing fast .
there are 63 privately run hospitals in the nhs pipeline already , with more being announced every month .
the trade unions believe that the government is mortgaging its future by giving private companies the right to run hospitals , schools and roads for periods of up to 30 years in return for a fixed yearly payment .
they say this will be much more expensive in the long run than the government building the hospitals and schools itself .
and they are worried that staff in the new private hospitals or schools will be employed on worse conditions than when they worked for the nhs or local government .
unison has won some concessions in this area , with a code of conduct applying to workers in local government - including schools - which guarantees that new staff will be offered " broadly comparable " conditions , and an agreement that 85 % of workers in private hospitals will continue to be employed by the nhs .
the government says that pfi is a vital part of its plans to expand and modernise the public sector , and that using the private sector can mean better value for money .

three powerful unions are planning to table motions calling for a moratorium on any further private sector investment in public services . "
the government is relentlessly pursuing a policy that wastes money " dave prentis unison the leader of the tuc 's largest union , unison , told bbc radio 4 's today programme that the private finance initiative was a waste of time and money .
unison general secretary dave prentis said : " the government is relentlessly pursuing a policy that wastes money , wastes time and fails any objective test of value for money . "
we will resist the policy of depriving public projects of private finance " gordon brown " it is a policy that is squandering the only chance in a generation of renewing our public services .
" it can not be right that during a period of unprecedented public investment , huge profits are going into private pockets when these funds should be directed at essential public services . "
no u-turn the government is determined to press ahead with its private finance initiative , which it believes will allow hospitals and schools to be built faster - and for less public cash upfront - than the existing system .
gordon brown told the bbc that any delay was unacceptable .
he said that it was " completely unacceptable to put a moratorium on hospitals , schools , roads and rail projects , denying the public services they need and holding back the biggest investment programme the country has ever embarked on " .
" we will resist the policy of depriving public projects of private finance where necessary .
and we will resist the idea that we should return to reckless borrowing , " he added .
spreading fast the government 's private finance plans are growing fast .
there are 63 privately run hospitals in the nhs pipeline already , with more being announced every month .
the trade unions believe that the government is mortgaging its future by giving private companies the right to run hospitals , schools and roads for periods of up to 30 years in return for a fixed yearly payment .
they say this will be much more expensive in the long run than the government building the hospitals and schools itself .
and they are worried that staff in the new private hospitals or schools will be employed on worse conditions than when they worked for the nhs or local government .
unison has won some concessions in this area , with a code of conduct applying to workers in local government - including schools - which guarantees that new staff will be offered " broadly comparable " conditions , and an agreement that 85 % of workers in private hospitals will continue to be employed by the nhs .
the government says that pfi is a vital part of its plans to expand and modernise the public sector , and that using the private sector can mean better value for money .
far from rowing back from its ambitions , it is planning to expand pfi to more infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges .
and it wants to partly privatise council housing through the mass transfer of estates from local authorities to housing associations .

they have been renting a flat in leicester at a cost of £ 300 a month .
money they regard as wasted .
peer group pressure and fear of missing out on the property boom is at the root of christine and tom 's desire to buy .
" we watched our friends buy homes and see them double in value in less than three years , " christine told bbc news online .
job uncertainties ideally christine and tom say they would have bought last year .
but uncertainties over christine 's job - she is a graphic designer and tom is an architect - meant that they had to postpone house hunting for a while .
at that time they had set themselves a budget of £ 65,000-85,000 .
unfortunately in the time it took for christine to secure regular employment the property market goalposts had shifted .
christine and tom were now looking at properties priced near the £ 100,000 mark .
" if my job situation had have been better six months ago we probably would have been able to get a house for a lot less , " admits christine .
" i do think that the house price situation is getting out of control . "
" we have already decided that we will not be able to get married for a long time yet due to buying a house at such inflated prices " christine knight as a result , the couple face having to take on more debt or find a larger deposit .
despite a combined salary of £ 36,000 they say finding a larger deposit is a problem as whenever they save-up what they think is enough , property prices have risen again .
debt burden what is more , both christine and tom are creaking under a debt hangover from university .
between them they owe the student loan company £ 15,000 .
with a deposit seemingly out of reach , the couple are considering a 100 % mortgage .
however , they are afraid that a 100 % mortgage will be costly and leave them too exposed if the property market takes a turn for the worse .
marriage plans shelved but the draw of becoming a homeowner is strong for christine and tom .
they are even willing to postpone marriage plans .
" we have already decided that we will not be able to get married for a long time yet due to buying a house at such inflated prices , " christine said .
this is the advice our expert , ray boulger of mortgage advisers charcol , offered christine and tom " many couples are in the same boat as christine and tom .
in some areas prices are accelerating away from first-time buyers , as a result they are borrowing more and arranging 100 % mortgages .
the danger for these people is that interest rates will rise and property prices fall leaving 100 % borrowers in negative equity .
having a deposit is often best as it acts as a buffer against price falls .
however , on the other hand , both christine and tom seem happy with their job security .
fixed mortgage but i would recommend that as a first time buyer they took out a fixed rate mortgage - for at least two years - that way they can budget properly and will not be at the mercy of bank of england base rate moves . "
all in all , a 100 % mortgage may be the only option if they want to get on the property ladder quickly . "
ray boulger of mortgage advisers charcol in addition , the borrowing multiple - about 2.5-3 times income - is n't excessively high , not when compared to the 4-5 times income mortgages that some first-time buyers are taking out .
as for the student loan debt i do n't think tom or christine need lose much sleep , at a 2 % rate of interest it is a very cheap debt .
tread carefully all in all , a 100 % mortgage may be the only option if they want to get on the property ladder quickly .
but they have to be careful that they do n't get forced by a mortgage lender into accepting an uncompetitive rate of interest or stung by having to pay for expensive loan insurance .
fortunately , 100 % mortgages are n't as expensive as they once were .
there are many competitive deals on the market and all in all christine and tom would be best going for one of these . "
this is what christine and tom did they managed to find the right house for £ 83,000 - well within their price range .
the couple chose a 100 % mortgage but not a fixed interest rate arrangement . "
i have a brother and sister in hertfordshire who ca n't afford to buy a flat never mind a house . "
christine knight however , the mortgage rate is guaranteed to be no higher than 1 % below the bank of england base rate .
this arrangement will last for two years , then the couple 's mortgage will move onto the bank 's standard variable rate .
rock bottom survey what appealed to the cost-conscious couple was that the mortgage provider promised to carry out a property survey for a nominal £ 1 fee - potentially saving the couple several hundred pounds .
buying a house will stretch the couple finances in the short term and marriage may not be affordable , they still feel better placed than many .
" i have a brother and sister in hertfordshire who ca n't afford to buy a flat never mind a house , with bed-sits selling there for the same price of a three bed house in leicester , " said christine .
your comments i 'm currently renting a one bedroom flat with my partner for £ 450 a month and can see us staying there for some time .
i had seen a couple of properties a few years ago before prices shot through the roof , i just about had enough money behind me for a deposit although my wages would not have got me the place i wanted .
a few months later i had a decent pay rise from work and then the property market went crazy .
i consider myself to be on a decent wage , i put a certain amount of money away each month towards a deposit but now it 's not enough .
every time i look at property prices now they 've jumped another £ 5000-6000 every couple of months .
what chance do us first time buyers have ?
now i 'm just biding my time until this ridiculous situation comes to a head , bring on the bust !
simon clout , brighton , uk well , its a shame they have already gone ahead , since my advice would be to have forgot about buying a house right now ... wait for the inevitable crash that is going to happen , sooner rather than later .
christopher cook , uk i would love to move out of home but i would have to move 20-30 miles away to find an affordable area .
at 21 i don ¿ t have enough experience to work in a high powered and i cant afford a flat on my current wage .
the best i could do round here is a single room but i do n't see any point as i have got that at home .
its a vicious circle and the kind of thing that will drive the country into the ground chris ashbey , staines the current shortage of homes is making it a nightmare for young first time buyers such as myself .
we are faced with either paying way over the odds to get onto the housing ladder or wasting our money on rent .
chris , uk is n't it cool that people as young as this can afford to buy , never mind dream of buying , their own home while maintaining a decent standard of living .
leslie , uk the housing market is utterly ridiculous , as is the reporting which relies on biased reports from self interested government agencies and mortgage lenders .
everything is set against the first time buyer and only now are the very real social problems -lrb- lower birth rate , emigration of key workers , mugging etc . -rrb- resulting from this situation being considered .
these will cause untold misery for an entire generation of young people , not that the ' fat cat ' thirty some things care a jot having made substantial capital gains over the last few years .
on top of these unpleasant realities , the ' homeless generation ' are threatened with death by boredom at numerous dinner parties given by smug homeowners !
james , uk i can relate to the couple 's plight , i bought my starter home in st albans last year and have seen the prices of similar properties escalate to mammoth proportions .
i 'm worried that the next rung of the ladder may be out of reach for while to come as doing on your own means more pressure on your finances .
its really got to level out soon !
rebecca cole , england would it not ease the property market a little if a total ban was introduced on people owning more than one home .
while this may seem to infringe on the personal liberty of those who can afford to buy two or more homes , it would increase the liberty of those who can , at present , no longer afford to buy one .
bill wakefield , england the frenzy of people clamouring to buy houses at a point when they 've hit market highs reminds me of a similar situation on the nasdaq a few years ago .
needless to say the stock market eventually corrected itself and the housing market will too , that much is certain .
alistair mcnally , u.k why the obsession with owning a house ?
rents have been falling in much of the country recently so that it is now cheaper to rent , and this is no more money down the drain than interest on a mortgage is .
many continentals are happy to rent all their lives .
nick , london , uk the housing market , like all other markets , is simply reacting to the forces of supply and demand .
thirty years ago the " social norm " was to live with your parents , get married early and then buy your house .
now people are getting married later , but want to move out from their parents and get a place of their own .
this social change is increasing the demand for first-time buyer properties , although it is not helped by people jumping onto the " buy-to-let " bandwagon , but this particular phenomenon looks as though it may be coming to an end .
the answer , if there is one , is to either reduce demand , or increase supply , neither of which is likely in the short term .
pete , uk i am glad that christine and tom are finally able to buy somewhere .
unfortunately i , as a single woman now raising a young niece is unlikely to be able to afford anything in london on my salary of £ 21,000 .
what are people like me supposed to do ?
sonia , uk the property market is well and truly out of control , and it seems that lenders are all too happy to lend beyond buyers means in the short term with little consideration for what would happen to them if interest rates were to rise .
i understand exactly how christine and tom feel .
andrew , uk my partner and i are first time buyers , in march this year we offered £ 92,000 -lrb- the full asking price -rrb- for a 2 bed mid terrace house in harlow essex .
when the chain fell down in august the same property went back on the market for £ 115,000 - an increase of £ 23,000 in 4 months .
we now need to earn £ 46,000 between us to be able to get a mortgage to buy a very modest house in a very average town .
how can people save for a house when prices are increasing by £ 6,000 per month .
james , uk the current housing boom is typical of the dot com era .
it 's stoked up by the mortgage lenders -lrb- the more money they lend , the more interest payments they receive -rrb- , the bank of england -lrb- unwilling to stem house price inflation -rrb- and the government for failing to invest in social housing and planning .
what comes up , does come down !
it has done for the last 30 years and will do again .
david , uk i think some people are unrealistic about property .
it 's hard work to get on the property ladder - and sometimes small risks are necessary .
we live in london and could n't afford a deposit , so we borrowed over 100 % on a property two years go and never looked back .

russia 's ambitious oil companies - and to an extent the moscow government - would love to see iraq exporting freely again .
russian firms already control more than one-third of iraqi oil production , and are hungry for a larger share .
and while some of russia 's friends and partners in the west agitate for an escalation of hostilities against baghdad , moscow 's thirst for oil riches puts it in a tricky position .
oil majors muscle in russia 's biggest oil firm , lukoil , was the first foreign company to sign a contract with baghdad after the gulf war .
the iraqi oil sector relies on russian technology the west khurna oilfield project , in which lukoil has a 68 % stake , is thought to be one of the largest in iraq , but its development is banned under international sanctions .
tatneft , based in the russian region of tatarstan , helps iraq to explore for and produce oil under the united nations oil-for-food programme .
slavneft , a smaller russian company , has also been active in iraq , but has retreated from several projects there in recent months .
spying opportunities in the development of the oil sector , a bunch of other russian companies sell iraq machinery , spare parts and vehicles , and a recent estimate puts russian contracts with iraq at $ 4bn over the past 10 years .
baghdad benefits the benefits flow both ways .
not exactly surrounded by wealthy friends , baghdad relies on russian technology to keep its creaking industry in shape .
and it is now trying to trade contracts for political support .
earlier this year , in an attempt to persuade russia to pull out unilaterally from the un sanctions regime , baghdad started threatening to cancel the khurna project .
money worries now that international tension is reaching its peak , the question is which way russia will jump .
mr putin may ignore commercial considerations baghdad is leaning on russian contractors , pointing out that chinese and french companies have also expressed interest in iraqi opportunities .
iraq recently signed a co-operation programme with russia worth a notional $ 40bn , and still owes moscow some $ 8bn from the days of the soviet union .
if saddam hussein were unseated , russia 's chances of getting its hands on any of that money , or of retaining its privileged access to the market , would be slim .
pressure on putin so will this sway president vladimir putin ?
probably not .
russian oil firms , which used to operate more or less as the kremlin 's commercial arm , have lost influence rapidly in the putin era .
the process of privatisation and fragmentation of the industry , which plodded on throughout the 1990s , has reached its zenith over the past couple of years .
companies like lukoil are now richer and more successful than they have ever been ; at the same time , they are far less political .
mr putin , for all his nationalistic sentiment , is keen to be seen as a friend - if not ally - of the west .
he is unlikely to sacrifice that to satisfy his commercial cronies .

the plans for independent monitoring of paramilitary violence in northern ireland were announced by the secretary of state on wednesday .
the law and order action group will involve the attorney general , the chief constable and the lord chancellor 's department .
speaking on bbc radio ulster on thursday , northern ireland secretary john reid said the group had an important role to play . "
we want to know what the government is now going to do in respect of the broken ceasefires that have already occurred " jeffrey donaldson uup mp " it is to make absolutely plain that wild west behaviour will not be tolerated , " he said .
" it is also to see that everyone involved , right across the law and order and justice system , is operating together in a seamless unit aimed at getting better product at the end of it . "
however , lagan valley mp jeffrey donaldson said he did not think the move would go any way to addressing the extent of the problem of paramilitary violence in the province .
" we do n't need someone to tell us the level of violence that is on the streets , we know that already , " he said .
" john reid has turned a blind eye to the ira and to the loyalist paramilitaries and what they have been doing .
" we want to know what the government is now going to do in respect of the broken ceasefires that have already occurred . "
dr reid said the level of violence , including that committed by paramilitaries , remained a matter of " serious concern " .
he said he was still considering who to appoint but hoped to make a formal announcement soon .
the independent auditor is expected to issue quarterly reports , with the first to be delivered before christmas .
however , the political and legal decision on whether a ceasefire has been broken or not will rest with dr reid .
sinn fein president gerry adams described plans for a violence monitor as a " distraction " .
he was speaking after he and party colleagues held an hour -long meeting with the prime minister and dr reid in downing street on wednesday .
dr reid denied the plan was designed to help the ulster unionist leader david trimble ahead of the weekend meeting of his party 's ruling council .
he said an independent monitor was in the public interest .
the main objector to the plan has been sinn fein who said inviting an outsider in to scrutinise the ceasefires would not benefit the political process .
the sdlp opposed a monitor being appointed , but said now that it was going ahead , the british and irish governments should appoint monitors to look at paramilitary activity on both sides of the border .
the ulster unionists and democratic unionist party welcomed the measure as a way of putting pressure on republicans in particular .
the alliance party is taking credit for proposing the idea .
last year , dr reid declared the ceasefires of the largest loyalist organisation the ulster defence association and the loyalist volunteer force invalid .
since then , loyalists close to the uda leadership have met dr reid .

two weeks later , the motivations for the uprising remain uncertain , though representatives of the rebels told the bbc they were fighting dictatorship and had been treated as " slaves " by the government .

that brought to an end 39 years of stability and , by african standards , sustained economic growth and development .
the country achieved independence from france in 1960 under the leadership of felix houphouet-boigny .
he stressed the need for economic growth and good relations with france , which maintained a military base in the country .
the president ruled the country for 33 years , until his death in 1993 .
under mr houphouet-boigny ivory coast was stable but there was little real democracy and for much of his 33 year rule , the president maintained a one-party state .
the coup , which came six years after the president 's death , marked the start of a descent into political conflict marked by divisions between northerners and southerners , muslims and christians .
popular uprising the brief period of military rule was brought to an end in october and early november 2000 , following a popular uprising by ivorians against the military ruler robert guei , who had tried to claim that he had won presidential elections in october .
the uprising brought to power laurent gbagbo , who was widely believed to have won the elections called by general guei .
but the election had generated political violence between southern ivorian , mainly christian supporters of laurent gbagbo and supporters of the other main political leader , alassane ouattara , a muslim from the north of the country .
mr ouattara had been excluded from standing in the elections after it was declared that he had not been born a citizen of ivory coast - in june this year , his citizenship was finally restored .
failed coup the popular support for the end of military rule did not end the political violence and growing instability .
in january 2001 , there was an attempted coup by opposition elements within the army and in february of that year , an opposition politician was charged with illegal possession of arms and of plotting to destabilise the country .
throughout the year there was high political tension and accusations by mr ouattara 's supporters that the government was using ethnic and regional tensions to strengthen its own position and harass opponents .
president gbagbo gets his support mainly from the south the human rights group amnesty international accused the government 's security forces of extra-judicial killings of northern opponents - though ivorian courts acquitted eight gendarmes accused of killing people from the north .
in 2002 , there were attempts by the president , mr ouattara and the former military leader , robert guei to calm things down but this had little effect .
robert guei still commanded the loyalty of some sections of the army , particularly those recruited during his period in power - some of whom were thought by journalists in abidjan to be involved in thursday 's fighting .
in may this year , six people were sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for their roles in the coup attempt of 2001 .
but instability remained and in june there were violent clashes in the central town of daloa between supporters of the president 's party and those of mr ouattara 's rally of the republicans -lrb- rdr -rrb- .
tension was high during district elections in july - won by mr gbagbo 's ivorian popular front party - and the latest uprising is another indication that little has been done to heal the wounds inflicted on the country by years of regional and political conflict .

how can you avoid being a victim ?
do you feel society is now more or less safe ?
steve chamberlain , assistant chief constable of south yorkshire police answered your questions in a live forum for the bbc 's six o 'clock news , presented by manisha tank .
transcript manisha tank : thank you for joining us on the six forum .
i 'm manisha tank .
we 're talking about cracking crime in this forum .
it 's very high on the government 's agenda - in fact home secretary , david blunkett , wants 130,000 more officers on the beat .
there are also plans to get officers out of doing admin in their offices and onto the street more .
there are even rumblings that they 're being encouraged to eat in mcdonalds so there 's more visibility out on the street amongst the public .
but is all of this enough to actually reduce crime and what is society 's role in all of this ?
your e-mails have been rolling in on the subject and we 're going to put them now to steve chamberlain , assistant chief constable of south yorkshire police .
thanks for being with us mr chamberlain .
we 've had a huge response - obviously something that 's close to everybody 's heart .
eunice aswat in the uk asks : the government must bring in tougher laws to beat crime .
in the area i live , after 9 p.m. criminals pick and choose their victims , usually by mugging .
by the time the police arrive on the scene , they 're long gone .
only last night we called the police after a victim 's face was covered in blood when three muggers assailed him .
what can be done about this kind of thing ?
steve chamberlain : it 's both a police issue and other agencies and i think we 've just got to work together with the public to try and reduce that level of serious violence and crime in those particular areas .
but it has to be done with the community and we would like to do as much neighbourhood policing and quality of life policing in people 's backyards , that 's literally what they want as possible .
but when we also have to deal with murders , kidnaps , street robbery and burglary , it always takes resources .
so it 's a difficult balance to strike sometimes .
manisha tank : now obviously something like mugging is often attributed to youth crime in particular .
we 've had an e-mail in from ian in the uk who asks : not that i condone violence , but what i think is needed , in some circumstances , is a quick clip round the ear followed by a ride home in a police car .
would n't this solve some of the less serious youth crimes quite quickly ?
steve chamberlain : well of course we ca n't do the clip round the ear - i 'm afraid those days are long gone with human rights .
i 'm afraid there would be immediate complaints if we took that approach .
but we can deal with it properly if young people are offending - most criminals are aged between 16 and 24 - those are the people who are committing most of the crime and actually that 's the same group who are mostly the victims .
so that is the key group that we have to tackle .
but there are better ways of dealing with it .
if it 's a minor first offence then people can be cautioned .
but if it 's serious , then i afraid they have to go to court and go through the judicial process .
manisha tank : but sometimes unfortunately police officers are dealing with mindsets that no matter what they do there are some youths who will never get out of what is persistent crime committal .
edward in the uk asks : what is being done about youth crime ?
at the moment kids are well aware that the law is basically impotent when dealing with them and as a result they have a mindset that they can do anything - a mindset that continues into their adult life .
steve chamberlain : well that can be the case and sometimes drugs - particularly an increase in heroin and crack cocaine - can fuel that .
but some things can be done .
there is the principle and philosophy that 's gathering a lot of support of early family intervention .
that 's a multi-agency approach with health , housing and education to try and affect youngsters ' lives positively as early as possible .
but that requires quite a lot of effort and quite a lot of resources and actually to tackle these youngsters before they get into long-term prolific offending .
so we 're talking about trying to intervene at the ages of 6 , 8 , 10 instead of 16 - 18 years-old , when it 's too late .
manisha tank : let 's move on to resources .
we 've had an e-mail from c. cunliffe , cardiff who asks : the police say they need more funds but i 'd like to know where the extra revenue generated by speed camera fines is going ?
steve chamberlain : well the speed camera revenue is going straight back into reducing casualties on the road .
in some parts of the country death and serious injuries have been slashed by 30 % in one year and those fines go directly into paying for extra cameras , extra policing and also civilian support staff and extra processing of all that .
but the end result is fewer deaths , so it is not profit making at all .
manisha tank : sticking with this subject of money .
andrew rawnsley in blackpool asks : do you think that charging convicted felons for the expense of keeping them in prison would act as a deterrent or would it free up more money to help solve crime ?
steve chamberlain : when persistent offenders are in prison , they 're not committing offences out on the streets - that 's an obvious and one of the best deterrents because that means there will be fewer victims .
of course that is n't the complete answer - something has to happen to them whilst they 're in prison and when they 're released because if they 're just released back into the community with no attempt at rehabilitation , then they are going to offend again .
so it does reduce crime by putting people in prison but it requires quite an aftercare service as well .
manisha tank : i asked the question in the introduction to all of this - what can society do to help and perhaps you can help with some ideas .
we 've had an anonymous text message in : why do n't the councils get involved and offer a slight discount on council tax to people who perhaps volunteer to be special constables .
would things like that actually help ?
steve chamberlain : i do n't think that would be a useful way forward .
there is a lot of talk nationally about the special constabulary receiving expenses for what they do and some recompense .
but the special constabulary are not the only organisation now that are involved in low-level policing .
with the advent of street wardens and the potential of community support officers means that there are likely to be a much wider range of organisations trying to do this quality of life neighbourhood-style patrol which is important .
manisha tank : shaun dawson , derbyshire asks : it is good to know that there are more police employed .
but i feel that the question is - are these new resources being deployed correctly ?
people feel safer when they see a police officer patrolling the streets .
in derbyshire it is rare to see police officers in the village - in london it 's probably even less common .
why are n't beat bobbies more visible ?
there has been this big debate about police officers being stuck in offices doing administrative work .
steve chamberlain : well there are several issues there .
the first thing is that we support more officers out on the beat - we do aim to do that .
but when we do have , as i 've said , murder , rape , kidnap , burglary offences , auto crime and now street robber where there is a big focus - the resources have to come from somewhere .
it is the same officers who have to be moved from one function to another .
so , for example , in south yorkshire , officers from the traffic department are being redeployed - quite a large number - onto street crime .
it takes five or six years to recruit a police officer and to effectively train them so they 're quite specialist .
so it is a reasonably slow process but a very important one .
so it is about balancing those resources .
we have to make efficiency savings .
in the last four years , south yorkshire has had to put in £ 18 million of efficiency savings - over the same time , we reduced crime by 20 % .
so there has been a great deal of effort that goes in .
but the police support local neighbourhood policing but sometimes the demands of serious crime do take those officers away .
manisha tank : david krutski asks : in 10 years time , my daughter will be 16 .
what will the landscape of crime look like then ?
what will be the main threats and risks to my child and family ?
steve chamberlain : hopefully the first thing is that this prevalence of drug abuse - particularly heroin and crack cocaine that is accelerating across the country - hopefully that we reduce that across all agencies with the work of agencies and the police so the drug landscape is reduced .
that 's the first thing .
we have gone through times of low violence .
we 're going through a period now of increased violence , so hopefully again we can actually reduce that .
so i think violence and drugs are the two big enemies to actually reduce to make that child 's life a better prospect in 10 years time .
manisha tank : alison brown , hampshire asks : i have a feeling that criminals are given chance after chance .
why do n't we adopt a system of three strikes and you 're out - this perhaps would set the record straight for everyone , including the criminals ?
steve chamberlain : well we 'd have to applaud the government 's approach to actually improving the criminal justice system and speed up justice .
i think that 's one major benefit .
to give you an example , we recently had a robber who badly assaulted an old lady who between arrest and actual conviction to prison only took eight days and was sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
so i think that 's a major example of how things can be improved if there is the will and the mandate for all the agencies in the criminal justice service to work very closely together .
manisha tank : we have to wrap it up there .
steve chamberlain , assistant chief constable of south yorkshire police , thank you for taking the time out to be with us .

that 's a multi-agency approach with health , housing and education to try and affect youngsters ' lives positively as early as possible .
but that requires quite a lot of effort and quite a lot of resources and actually to tackle these youngsters before they get into long-term prolific offending .
so we 're talking about trying to intervene at the ages of 6 , 8 , 10 instead of 16 - 18 years-old , when it 's too late .
manisha tank : let 's move on to resources .
we 've had an e-mail from c. cunliffe , cardiff who asks : the police say they need more funds but i 'd like to know where the extra revenue generated by speed camera fines is going ?
steve chamberlain : well the speed camera revenue is going straight back into reducing casualties on the road .
in some parts of the country death and serious injuries have been slashed by 30 % in one year and those fines go directly into paying for extra cameras , extra policing and also civilian support staff and extra processing of all that .
but the end result is fewer deaths , so it is not profit making at all .
manisha tank : sticking with this subject of money .
andrew rawnsley in blackpool asks : do you think that charging convicted felons for the expense of keeping them in prison would act as a deterrent or would it free up more money to help solve crime ?
steve chamberlain : when persistent offenders are in prison , they 're not committing offences out on the streets - that 's an obvious and one of the best deterrents because that means there will be fewer victims .
of course that is n't the complete answer - something has to happen to them whilst they 're in prison and when they 're released because if they 're just released back into the community with no attempt at rehabilitation , then they are going to offend again .
so it does reduce crime by putting people in prison but it requires quite an aftercare service as well .
manisha tank : i asked the question in the introduction to all of this - what can society do to help and perhaps you can help with some ideas .
we 've had an anonymous text message in : why do n't the councils get involved and offer a slight discount on council tax to people who perhaps volunteer to be special constables .
would things like that actually help ?
steve chamberlain : i do n't think that would be a useful way forward .
there is a lot of talk nationally about the special constabulary receiving expenses for what they do and some recompense .
but the special constabulary are not the only organisation now that are involved in low-level policing .
with the advent of street wardens and the potential of community support officers means that there are likely to be a much wider range of organisations trying to do this quality of life neighbourhood-style patrol which is important .
manisha tank : shaun dawson , derbyshire asks : it is good to know that there are more police employed .
but i feel that the question is - are these new resources being deployed correctly ?
people feel safer when they see a police officer patrolling the streets .
in derbyshire it is rare to see police officers in the village - in london it 's probably even less common .
why are n't beat bobbies more visible ?
there has been this big debate about police officers being stuck in offices doing administrative work .
steve chamberlain : well there are several issues there .
the first thing is that we support more officers out on the beat - we do aim to do that .
but when we do have , as i 've said , murder , rape , kidnap , burglary offences , auto crime and now street robber where there is a big focus - the resources have to come from somewhere .
it is the same officers who have to be moved from one function to another .
so , for example , in south yorkshire , officers from the traffic department are being redeployed - quite a large number - onto street crime .
it takes five or six years to recruit a police officer and to effectively train them so they 're quite specialist .
so it is a reasonably slow process but a very important one .
so it is about balancing those resources .
we have to make efficiency savings .
in the last four years , south yorkshire has had to put in £ 18 million of efficiency savings - over the same time , we reduced crime by 20 % .
so there has been a great deal of effort that goes in .
but the police support local neighbourhood policing but sometimes the demands of serious crime do take those officers away .
manisha tank : david krutski asks : in 10 years time , my daughter will be 16 .
what will the landscape of crime look like then ?
what will be the main threats and risks to my child and family ?
steve chamberlain : hopefully the first thing is that this prevalence of drug abuse - particularly heroin and crack cocaine that is accelerating across the country - hopefully that we reduce that across all agencies with the work of agencies and the police so the drug landscape is reduced .
that 's the first thing .
we have gone through times of low violence .
we 're going through a period now of increased violence , so hopefully again we can actually reduce that .
so i think violence and drugs are the two big enemies to actually reduce to make that child 's life a better prospect in 10 years time .
manisha tank : alison brown , hampshire asks : i have a feeling that criminals are given chance after chance .
why do n't we adopt a system of three strikes and you 're out - this perhaps would set the record straight for everyone , including the criminals ?
steve chamberlain : well we 'd have to applaud the government 's approach to actually improving the criminal justice system and speed up justice .
i think that 's one major benefit .
to give you an example , we recently had a robber who badly assaulted an old lady who between arrest and actual conviction to prison only took eight days and was sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
so i think that 's a major example of how things can be improved if there is the will and the mandate for all the agencies in the criminal justice service to work very closely together .
manisha tank : we have to wrap it up there .
steve chamberlain , assistant chief constable of south yorkshire police , thank you for taking the time out to be with us .
