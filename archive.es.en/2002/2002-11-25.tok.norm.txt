program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.11.2002 love and betrayal in the animal kingdom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals - we use them , we kill them , we love them .
in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals . we love animals , but we also kill them .
we cuddle them , but we also hunt them .
we revere them , but we also use them .
we mass produce livestock , we keep house pets , we go on luxury safaris and , at the same time , we protect endangered species .
the list of incredible contradictions in the relationship between humans and the animal kingdom seems endless and is now the focus of a new exhibit at the german hygiene museum in dresden titled , " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " .
the exhibit begins in a dimly-lit room .
loud speakers pipe out the sounds of many different types of animals .
hundreds of rubber animals are held in a case behind small adam and eve figures .
it 's clear from the beginning that the show 's creators have also infused a dose of humor into a provocative and deep subject .
tough moral questions " the exhibit is really about the self-image of humans , " says curator jasdan joerges .
" what 's so distinguishing about humans ?
what makes them human ?
who wears the crown of creation ?
will animals in the future need a bigger divide from humans ?
do we need new ethics for an animal of the future ?
these are the kinds of questions this exhibit deals with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals are a central component of human culture and civilization .
without them , we humans never would have become what we are today .
the first thematic block of the exhibit , under the title " beloved animals , " examines that motif .
the wide-reaching exhibit covers everything from hunting as an existential necessity to killing for sport , to the exotic menageries kept by european dynasties to today 's zoos , which have become the last refuges for some endangered species .
from the everyday to the bizarre the hygiene museum also devotes considerable space to examining the complex relationship between humans and their pets .
" the rank of house pets as a social and economic factor is enormous , " says joerges .
" it 's a billion euro industry .
we show everything here from jars from germany 's first blood bank for dogs to animal coffins to wedding dresses for dogs to fish-flavored toothpaste for cats to a model used to teach mouth-to-snout cpr . "
the show brings together more than 750 artifacts including paintings , films , stuffed animals and everyday objects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.11.2002 germans invent super sponge for oil spill cleanup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will new technology prevent oil spills from disrupting the fragile ecosystem ?
berlin-based eco.carbon has developed a new material that could be used to soak up oil from spills like the tanker disaster in spain last week .
but the product has n't yet been tested on a wide scale . on nov .
19 , the oil tanker " prestige " broke apart and sank 250 kilometers off the coast of northern spain .
more than 70,000 metric tons of heavy oil threatens to leak into the atlantic and cause an environmental catastrophe and creating an enormous toxic mess to clean up .
the most common method of cleaning up after an oil spill is to erect barriers in the water and skim off the oil by hand .
but that only works in very calm seas .
british crews employ chemical cleaning agents , which are dropped from airplanes or boats directly onto the spill .
the oil then breaks down into tiny droplets , but the chemicals remain in the water and can kill fish and other marine life .
the " sponge " enter eco.carbon , a berlin-based company that has developed an alternative method for cleaning up oil spills .
eco.carbon has invented a giant sponge made of lignite resin that sucks up the oil , preventing it from harming the environment .
but that invention has yet to be tested under real conditions .
the material is water resistant , it does n't sink and it 's designed to absorb maximum amounts of oil .
the inside of the mat contains crushed coal , whose small granules can soak up especially large amounts of oil .
the process is safe and cheap .
the mats have so far withstood small-scale testing in pools of water with miniature oil slicks .
the berlin inventors have sold their invention mainly to disaster control teams and firefighters .
the scientists have a lot of confidence in their wonder weapon .
the mat method " we figure that you 'd need about 100 mats to collect a ton of oil from water , " says eco.carbon 's andreas jonas .
" the number of mats you need is n't determined by the size of the oil slick , but by the amount of oil spilled .
the mats do n't have to completely cover the oil spill . "
a unique advantage is that once the oil is absorbed into the mat , it remains fixed there permanently .
the downside , however , is that the mats become toxic waste .
even so , the inventors are convinced that their product will be a success - even on the high seas .
" the mats were tested for their effectiveness in water and we also tested to make sure that mats saturated with oil remained afloat for several days , " jonas says .
" we do n't think that the mats will go under in rough seas and that they will be able to stand up against huge waves . "
that would make using the mats more effective than clean-up methods currently in use and at just a third of the cost .
" to make the most effective use of the mats , large quantities would have to be able to reach the disaster scene , for example stranded ships , as quickly as possible , " says jonas .
" so it would be important for coast guards to maintain a supply of mats .
that is , depots should be set up along coastlines that are especially threatened so that the mats are readily available . "
fighting oil with bacteria but the scientists at eco.carbon are also trying to improve other methods to fight oil spills .
at the scenes of oil spills around the world , they 've found bacteria that seem to have an appetite for the toxic black sludge .
now , the scientists are breeding the bacteria .
the scientists are studying the different bacteria to determine which is most effective at reducing oil levels .
eventually , the hope to put the best bacteria to work in helping clean up after oil spill disasters .
but all of these efforts ca n't prevent the devastating environmental damage caused by the tanker accident .
if the prestige were now to lose the remaining 65,000 tons of its cargo , little could be done to prevent the environmental catastrophe awaiting the spanish coastline . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

berlin-based eco.carbon has developed a new material that could be used to soak up oil from spills like the tanker disaster in spain last week .
but the product has n't yet been tested on a wide scale . on nov .
19 , the oil tanker " prestige " broke apart and sank 250 kilometers off the coast of northern spain .
more than 70,000 metric tons of heavy oil threatens to leak into the atlantic and cause an environmental catastrophe and creating an enormous toxic mess to clean up .
the most common method of cleaning up after an oil spill is to erect barriers in the water and skim off the oil by hand .
but that only works in very calm seas .
british crews employ chemical cleaning agents , which are dropped from airplanes or boats directly onto the spill .
the oil then breaks down into tiny droplets , but the chemicals remain in the water and can kill fish and other marine life .
the " sponge " enter eco.carbon , a berlin-based company that has developed an alternative method for cleaning up oil spills .
eco.carbon has invented a giant sponge made of lignite resin that sucks up the oil , preventing it from harming the environment .
but that invention has yet to be tested under real conditions .
the material is water resistant , it does n't sink and it 's designed to absorb maximum amounts of oil .
the inside of the mat contains crushed coal , whose small granules can soak up especially large amounts of oil .
the process is safe and cheap .
the mats have so far withstood small-scale testing in pools of water with miniature oil slicks .
the berlin inventors have sold their invention mainly to disaster control teams and firefighters .
the scientists have a lot of confidence in their wonder weapon .
the mat method " we figure that you 'd need about 100 mats to collect a ton of oil from water , " says eco.carbon 's andreas jonas .
" the number of mats you need is n't determined by the size of the oil slick , but by the amount of oil spilled .
the mats do n't have to completely cover the oil spill . "
a unique advantage is that once the oil is absorbed into the mat , it remains fixed there permanently .
the downside , however , is that the mats become toxic waste .
even so , the inventors are convinced that their product will be a success - even on the high seas .
" the mats were tested for their effectiveness in water and we also tested to make sure that mats saturated with oil remained afloat for several days , " jonas says .
" we do n't think that the mats will go under in rough seas and that they will be able to stand up against huge waves . "
that would make using the mats more effective than clean-up methods currently in use and at just a third of the cost .
" to make the most effective use of the mats , large quantities would have to be able to reach the disaster scene , for example stranded ships , as quickly as possible , " says jonas .
" so it would be important for coast guards to maintain a supply of mats .
that is , depots should be set up along coastlines that are especially threatened so that the mats are readily available . "
fighting oil with bacteria but the scientists at eco.carbon are also trying to improve other methods to fight oil spills .
at the scenes of oil spills around the world , they 've found bacteria that seem to have an appetite for the toxic black sludge .
now , the scientists are breeding the bacteria .
the scientists are studying the different bacteria to determine which is most effective at reducing oil levels .
eventually , the hope to put the best bacteria to work in helping clean up after oil spill disasters .
but all of these efforts ca n't prevent the devastating environmental damage caused by the tanker accident .

he already did a six-week sentence earlier this year for ransacking a mcdonald 's construction site in the southern french town millau .

austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear . austria 's conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has emerged as the strongest political power after sunday 's general election .
with 42.3 percent of the vote , it will lead the country for the first time since 1966 . the landslide victory of the conservatives came as a surprise : pollsters had predicted that both the övp and the social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- would bring in roughly the same amount of votes .

the chaos and disarray in the fpö had forced chancellor schlüssel to call elections a year before the end of the legislative period in the first place .
it also brought his party its election victory ; analysts believe that increased support for the övp came from voters disenchanted with the fpö .
in september , fissures in the fpö turned into ruptures at the party convention in knitterfeld when the party broke into two wings : a more liberal wing supportive of then-party leader susanne riess-passer and the followers of the extreme anti-immigrant and anti-eu party founder , jörg haider .

" our place is in the opposition , " he confirmed .

nothing has been prearranged , " the chancellor told austrian television . but despite those assurances , another övp-fpö coalition seems likely .
on top of the social democrats ' rejection , green party leader alexander van der bellen has said no to forming a coalition with the conservatives . freedom party head herbert haupt , meanwhile , took responsibility for the fpö 's poor showing , while emphasizing that he hopes to remain in his position .
he also spoke out in favor of another övp-fpö coalition .
before the election the de facto party leader jörg haider had rejected the idea of his party entering into another government with the people 's party . european reactions the european press has largely welcomed the freedom party 's fall . the german daily süddeutsche zeitung comments that : " the fpö is one of the first unrestrictedly populist parties in europe that has been in the awkward position of having to realize its promises .
the result is its total lack of credibility . "
according to italy 's la repubblica , the election shows that " the wave of euro-populist xenophobia is on its way out of europe . " the dutch daily volkskrant looks at the balance for chancellor schüssel : " political observers believe that he consciously pursued a strategy to bring the freedom patty down a notch by giving it governmental responsibilities .

" at the same time , the spanish daily el pais writes that schüssel faces two unappetizing choices : another coalition with the freedom party , could end up with the fpö breaking up , leaving schüssel to face a stronger opposition without a majority .
a coalition with the social democrats , however , could cause the same situation that brought the far-right into the government in the first place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2002 the “ car chancellor ” loses some of his sheen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bumpy ride - chancellor schröder has raised hackles in the car industry already under fire for raising taxes , chancellor schröder is facing new criticism from his one-time allies in the automotive industry .
they warn that proposed tax hikes on company cars could cost thousands of jobs . the german auto industry ’ s love affair with gerhard schröder has screeched to a halt in the wake of announced plans by the chancellor ’ s governing coalition to raise taxes on the private use of company cars by 50 percent . “ that not only affects the driver , but influences sales and jobs in the german automobile industry — in a negative way , ” wendelin wiedeking , head of porsche , said in a newspaper interview . according to the association of the german automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , some two million drivers of company cars will be affected by the tax hike , which will tax privately used company cars by 1.5 percent of the list price in the future .
the current rate is one percent . according to the vda , some 500,000 cars which are sold annually will meet the criteria for the new tax rate .
if leased vehicles are included , approximately 800,000 cars in total will be affected .
the automotive group says it fears the higher tax rate would mean more employees would reconsider using official cars for private use and as a result , fewer would be sold .
ferdinand dudenhöffer of the center of automotive research predicts sales could fall by some 150,000 cars annually . those that do choose to drive company cars , according to the vda , would forego size and luxury in their choice of automobiles , effectively “ downsizing ” so as to save on taxes . the result of all this , according to vda calculations , would be a sales downturn of some 2.6 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- annually and a possible loss of 10,000 jobs . “ car chancellor ” standing his ground the finance ministry has rejected the allegations , calling the gloomy predictions “ exaggerated . ”
the government is standing its ground on the issue , even though the powerful german automotive industry has traditionally had a considerable influence even at the highest levels of government . that is particularly true in the case of gerhard schröder , who even earned the nickname of “ car chancellor , ” due to the fact that he sat on the supervisory board of volkswagen , headquartered in his home state of north rhine-westphalia , and has always aggressively defended carmakers ' interests .
in general , the chancellor has enjoyed the good-will of many in the car industry , and was always a welcome guest in the “ schrempp circle , ” a group of auto executives headed by daimler-chrysler ceo jürgen schrempp which meets regularly to talk shop . but those warm feelings began to cool during schröder ’ s recent re-election campaign .
auto executives were unhappy with the chancellor ’ s stance on iraq and his outspoken opposition to us president george w. bush .
between 1998 and 2001 , audi , bmw , mercedes , porsche and vw watched their us market share rise from 6.6 to 9.3 percent and the carmakers did not want to see those numbers suffer due to fissures in german-american relations and perceptions of anti-americanism in germany . despite the criticism , the government shows no sign of budging on the company car issue .
finance minister hans eichel badly needs to compensate for budgetary shortfalls and he is hoping the tax hike will translate into an additional 500 million euro -lrb- $ 496 million -rrb- for the state ’ s strained coffers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german car maker bmw motors ahead despite an overall slump in the global automobile market , german car maker bmw has remained in good shape , and looks to surpass the million cars sold mark soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.11.2002 conservatives win big in austrian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schüssel defended his position as chancellor in austrian elections .
austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear . austria 's conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has emerged as the strongest political power after sunday 's general election .
with 42.3 percent of the vote , it will lead the country for the first time since 1966 . the landslide victory of the conservatives came as a surprise : pollsters had predicted that both the övp and the social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- would bring in roughly the same amount of votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the govenor of the austrian province carinthia rightist joerg haider from the freedom party puts his pooling card into the ballot box on sunday nov .
24 , 2002 in klagenfurt , austria .
-lrb- ap photo / gert eggenberger -rrb- more surprising still , jörg haider , the freedom party 's charismatic and controversial leader has announced his resignation as the governor of carinthia as a consequence of his party 's poor showing in the election .
the far-right fpö earned only 10.2 percent of the vote , losing two-thirds of its voters after bringing in 26.9 percent in 1999 .
the chaos and disarray in the fpö had forced chancellor schlüssel to call elections a year before the end of the legislative period in the first place .
it also brought his party its election victory ; analysts believe that increased support for the övp came from voters disenchanted with the fpö .
in september , fissures in the fpö turned into ruptures at the party convention in knitterfeld when the party broke into two wings : a more liberal wing supportive of then-party leader susanne riess-passer and the followers of the extreme anti-immigrant and anti-eu party founder , jörg haider .
four freedom party ministers , including riess-passer , resigned from the government . little choice for a junior partner spö party head alfred gusenbauer conceded defeat sunday evening .
the party did bring in 36.9 percent of voted -lrb- up 3.8 points from last election -rrb- , but thanks to the poor showing of the green party -lrb- 9.0 percent -rrb- , the social democrats wo n't be able to command a red-green government . gusenbauer confirmed that his party would not betray its campaign promises by entering into a coalition with the övp .
" our place is in the opposition , " he confirmed .
before the election gusenbauer had announced that if the spö came in second it would remain in the opposition . chancellor wolfgang schüssel has said that he will hold coalition talks with all three of the other leading parties . " we want to hold frank talks with all three parties .
nothing has been prearranged , " the chancellor told austrian television . but despite those assurances , another övp-fpö coalition seems likely .
on top of the social democrats ' rejection , green party leader alexander van der bellen has said no to forming a coalition with the conservatives . freedom party head herbert haupt , meanwhile , took responsibility for the fpö 's poor showing , while emphasizing that he hopes to remain in his position .
he also spoke out in favor of another övp-fpö coalition .
before the election the de facto party leader jörg haider had rejected the idea of his party entering into another government with the people 's party . european reactions the european press has largely welcomed the freedom party 's fall . the german daily süddeutsche zeitung comments that : " the fpö is one of the first unrestrictedly populist parties in europe that has been in the awkward position of having to realize its promises .
the result is its total lack of credibility . "
according to italy 's la repubblica , the election shows that " the wave of euro-populist xenophobia is on its way out of europe . " the dutch daily volkskrant looks at the balance for chancellor schüssel : " political observers believe that he consciously pursued a strategy to bring the freedom patty down a notch by giving it governmental responsibilities .
the election shows that he succeeded .
now schüssel can hold his head high when he meets his colleagues in europe or show them the finger . " at the same time , the spanish daily el pais writes that schüssel faces two unappetizing choices : another coalition with the freedom party , could end up with the fpö breaking up , leaving schüssel to face a stronger opposition without a majority .
a coalition with the social democrats , however , could cause the same situation that brought the far-right into the government in the first place .
more of the conservative status quo schüssel 's new government is likely to continue its aims to limit deficit spending , pursue liberalization and privatize state stakes in austrian companies .
the övp is also a strong supporter of eu enlargement . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .
jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .
far-right austrian leader faces uphill battle controversial austrian politician jörg haider has returned to lead his freedom party shortly ahead of new parliamentary elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2002 germany 's winter of discontent looms large großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much to smile about - german finance minister eichel businesses and financial institutions are preparing for the german economy to fall into a recession .
a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .
22 .
but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .
on nov .
13 , tax estimates were drastically revised downwards : the state would collect 31 billion euros less than planned .
then the government ’ s panel of economic experts said germany would most probably violate the eu ’ s deficit limit next year too , and brussels agreed and announced the start of formal disciplinary procedures . to cap it all off , the opposition , still smarting from its narrow defeat in the elections , accused the government of lying to voters . the slide from optimism to bleak pessimism has been extraordinarily rapid , and prospects seem to deteriorate by the day .

a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .
22 .
but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .
on nov .
13 , tax estimates were drastically revised downwards : the state would collect 31 billion euros less than planned .
then the government ’ s panel of economic experts said germany would most probably violate the eu ’ s deficit limit next year too , and brussels agreed and announced the start of formal disciplinary procedures . to cap it all off , the opposition , still smarting from its narrow defeat in the elections , accused the government of lying to voters . the slide from optimism to bleak pessimism has been extraordinarily rapid , and prospects seem to deteriorate by the day .

when he rushed to yassir arafat 's headquarters in ramallah to show support for the besieged palestinian leader this spring after a meeting of globalization critics in porto allegre , brazil , critics said he had lost his footing . now the french daily " figaro " writes that bové has made his second mistake : instead of becoming a martyr for his cause , appealing for a pardon has turned him into a clown . bové , however , says he will take his case to the european court for human rights .
standing on the steps to the court that threw out his appeal , he insisted that injustice had been done .
according to the farmer-activist , the last time trade unionists were imprisoned in france was under the vichy regime during world war ii . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links gm food and mad cows play the josé bové game and wipe out gm corn and mad cows . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

berlin-based eco.carbon has developed a new material that could be used to soak up oil from spills like the tanker disaster in spain last week .
but the product has n't yet been tested on a wide scale . on nov .
19 , the oil tanker " prestige " broke apart and sank 250 kilometers off the coast of northern spain .
more than 70,000 metric tons of heavy oil threatens to leak into the atlantic and cause an environmental catastrophe and creating an enormous toxic mess to clean up .
the most common method of cleaning up after an oil spill is to erect barriers in the water and skim off the oil by hand .
but that only works in very calm seas .
british crews employ chemical cleaning agents , which are dropped from airplanes or boats directly onto the spill .
the oil then breaks down into tiny droplets , but the chemicals remain in the water and can kill fish and other marine life .
the " sponge " enter eco.carbon , a berlin-based company that has developed an alternative method for cleaning up oil spills .
eco.carbon has invented a giant sponge made of lignite resin that sucks up the oil , preventing it from harming the environment .
but that invention has yet to be tested under real conditions .
the material is water resistant , it does n't sink and it 's designed to absorb maximum amounts of oil .
the inside of the mat contains crushed coal , whose small granules can soak up especially large amounts of oil .
the process is safe and cheap .
the mats have so far withstood small-scale testing in pools of water with miniature oil slicks .
the berlin inventors have sold their invention mainly to disaster control teams and firefighters .
the scientists have a lot of confidence in their wonder weapon .
the mat method " we figure that you 'd need about 100 mats to collect a ton of oil from water , " says eco.carbon 's andreas jonas .
" the number of mats you need is n't determined by the size of the oil slick , but by the amount of oil spilled .
the mats do n't have to completely cover the oil spill . "
a unique advantage is that once the oil is absorbed into the mat , it remains fixed there permanently .
the downside , however , is that the mats become toxic waste .
even so , the inventors are convinced that their product will be a success - even on the high seas .
" the mats were tested for their effectiveness in water and we also tested to make sure that mats saturated with oil remained afloat for several days , " jonas says .
" we do n't think that the mats will go under in rough seas and that they will be able to stand up against huge waves . "
that would make using the mats more effective than clean-up methods currently in use and at just a third of the cost .
" to make the most effective use of the mats , large quantities would have to be able to reach the disaster scene , for example stranded ships , as quickly as possible , " says jonas .
" so it would be important for coast guards to maintain a supply of mats .
that is , depots should be set up along coastlines that are especially threatened so that the mats are readily available . "
fighting oil with bacteria but the scientists at eco.carbon are also trying to improve other methods to fight oil spills .
at the scenes of oil spills around the world , they 've found bacteria that seem to have an appetite for the toxic black sludge .
now , the scientists are breeding the bacteria .
the scientists are studying the different bacteria to determine which is most effective at reducing oil levels .
eventually , the hope to put the best bacteria to work in helping clean up after oil spill disasters .
but all of these efforts ca n't prevent the devastating environmental damage caused by the tanker accident .

in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals . we love animals , but we also kill them .
we cuddle them , but we also hunt them .
we revere them , but we also use them .
we mass produce livestock , we keep house pets , we go on luxury safaris and , at the same time , we protect endangered species .
the list of incredible contradictions in the relationship between humans and the animal kingdom seems endless and is now the focus of a new exhibit at the german hygiene museum in dresden titled , " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " .
the exhibit begins in a dimly-lit room .
loud speakers pipe out the sounds of many different types of animals .
hundreds of rubber animals are held in a case behind small adam and eve figures .
it 's clear from the beginning that the show 's creators have also infused a dose of humor into a provocative and deep subject .
tough moral questions " the exhibit is really about the self-image of humans , " says curator jasdan joerges .
" what 's so distinguishing about humans ?
what makes them human ?
who wears the crown of creation ?
will animals in the future need a bigger divide from humans ?
do we need new ethics for an animal of the future ?
these are the kinds of questions this exhibit deals with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals are a central component of human culture and civilization .
without them , we humans never would have become what we are today .
the first thematic block of the exhibit , under the title " beloved animals , " examines that motif .
the wide-reaching exhibit covers everything from hunting as an existential necessity to killing for sport , to the exotic menageries kept by european dynasties to today 's zoos , which have become the last refuges for some endangered species .
from the everyday to the bizarre the hygiene museum also devotes considerable space to examining the complex relationship between humans and their pets .
" the rank of house pets as a social and economic factor is enormous , " says joerges .
" it 's a billion euro industry .
we show everything here from jars from germany 's first blood bank for dogs to animal coffins to wedding dresses for dogs to fish-flavored toothpaste for cats to a model used to teach mouth-to-snout cpr . "
the show brings together more than 750 artifacts including paintings , films , stuffed animals and everyday objects .
it also includes its share of strange stuff , like a real elephant foot that was made into a trash can and given to former east german president wilhelm pieck on the occasion of his 80th birthday .
all of the exhibits are displayed behind a wire-netting fence , which is meant to symbolize the border between humans and animals .
a world divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " the fence is omnipresent in the first three sections of the exhibit , signifying how humans have tinkered with animals and sought to perfect certain species over thousands of years .
we 've used genetic engineering to add ribs in order to produce more meat cutlets and we 've devised technical equipment that guarantees the continued existence of breeding animals .
but it also leaves you asking yourself exactly the questions the curators intended .
how far should humans be able to go in their relationships with animals ?
should humans be able to experiment with animals that the latest scientific discoveries show share most of our genes ?

austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear . austria 's conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has emerged as the strongest political power after sunday 's general election .
with 42.3 percent of the vote , it will lead the country for the first time since 1966 . the landslide victory of the conservatives came as a surprise : pollsters had predicted that both the övp and the social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- would bring in roughly the same amount of votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the govenor of the austrian province carinthia rightist joerg haider from the freedom party puts his pooling card into the ballot box on sunday nov .
24 , 2002 in klagenfurt , austria .
-lrb- ap photo / gert eggenberger -rrb- more surprising still , jörg haider , the freedom party 's charismatic and controversial leader has announced his resignation as the governor of carinthia as a consequence of his party 's poor showing in the election .
the far-right fpö earned only 10.2 percent of the vote , losing two-thirds of its voters after bringing in 26.9 percent in 1999 .
the chaos and disarray in the fpö had forced chancellor schlüssel to call elections a year before the end of the legislative period in the first place .
it also brought his party its election victory ; analysts believe that increased support for the övp came from voters disenchanted with the fpö .
in september , fissures in the fpö turned into ruptures at the party convention in knitterfeld when the party broke into two wings : a more liberal wing supportive of then-party leader susanne riess-passer and the followers of the extreme anti-immigrant and anti-eu party founder , jörg haider .
four freedom party ministers , including riess-passer , resigned from the government . little choice for a junior partner spö party head alfred gusenbauer conceded defeat sunday evening .
the party did bring in 36.9 percent of voted -lrb- up 3.8 points from last election -rrb- , but thanks to the poor showing of the green party -lrb- 9.0 percent -rrb- , the social democrats wo n't be able to command a red-green government . gusenbauer confirmed that his party would not betray its campaign promises by entering into a coalition with the övp .
" our place is in the opposition , " he confirmed .
before the election gusenbauer had announced that if the spö came in second it would remain in the opposition . chancellor wolfgang schüssel has said that he will hold coalition talks with all three of the other leading parties . " we want to hold frank talks with all three parties .
nothing has been prearranged , " the chancellor told austrian television . but despite those assurances , another övp-fpö coalition seems likely .
on top of the social democrats ' rejection , green party leader alexander van der bellen has said no to forming a coalition with the conservatives . freedom party head herbert haupt , meanwhile , took responsibility for the fpö 's poor showing , while emphasizing that he hopes to remain in his position .
he also spoke out in favor of another övp-fpö coalition .
before the election the de facto party leader jörg haider had rejected the idea of his party entering into another government with the people 's party . european reactions the european press has largely welcomed the freedom party 's fall . the german daily süddeutsche zeitung comments that : " the fpö is one of the first unrestrictedly populist parties in europe that has been in the awkward position of having to realize its promises .
the result is its total lack of credibility . "
according to italy 's la repubblica , the election shows that " the wave of euro-populist xenophobia is on its way out of europe . " the dutch daily volkskrant looks at the balance for chancellor schüssel : " political observers believe that he consciously pursued a strategy to bring the freedom patty down a notch by giving it governmental responsibilities .
the election shows that he succeeded .
now schüssel can hold his head high when he meets his colleagues in europe or show them the finger . " at the same time , the spanish daily el pais writes that schüssel faces two unappetizing choices : another coalition with the freedom party , could end up with the fpö breaking up , leaving schüssel to face a stronger opposition without a majority .
a coalition with the social democrats , however , could cause the same situation that brought the far-right into the government in the first place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2002 the “ car chancellor ” loses some of his sheen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bumpy ride - chancellor schröder has raised hackles in the car industry already under fire for raising taxes , chancellor schröder is facing new criticism from his one-time allies in the automotive industry .
they warn that proposed tax hikes on company cars could cost thousands of jobs . the german auto industry ’ s love affair with gerhard schröder has screeched to a halt in the wake of announced plans by the chancellor ’ s governing coalition to raise taxes on the private use of company cars by 50 percent . “ that not only affects the driver , but influences sales and jobs in the german automobile industry — in a negative way , ” wendelin wiedeking , head of porsche , said in a newspaper interview . according to the association of the german automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , some two million drivers of company cars will be affected by the tax hike , which will tax privately used company cars by 1.5 percent of the list price in the future .
the current rate is one percent . according to the vda , some 500,000 cars which are sold annually will meet the criteria for the new tax rate .
if leased vehicles are included , approximately 800,000 cars in total will be affected .
the automotive group says it fears the higher tax rate would mean more employees would reconsider using official cars for private use and as a result , fewer would be sold .
ferdinand dudenhöffer of the center of automotive research predicts sales could fall by some 150,000 cars annually . those that do choose to drive company cars , according to the vda , would forego size and luxury in their choice of automobiles , effectively “ downsizing ” so as to save on taxes . the result of all this , according to vda calculations , would be a sales downturn of some 2.6 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- annually and a possible loss of 10,000 jobs . “ car chancellor ” standing his ground the finance ministry has rejected the allegations , calling the gloomy predictions “ exaggerated . ”
the government is standing its ground on the issue , even though the powerful german automotive industry has traditionally had a considerable influence even at the highest levels of government . that is particularly true in the case of gerhard schröder , who even earned the nickname of “ car chancellor , ” due to the fact that he sat on the supervisory board of volkswagen , headquartered in his home state of north rhine-westphalia , and has always aggressively defended carmakers ' interests .
in general , the chancellor has enjoyed the good-will of many in the car industry , and was always a welcome guest in the “ schrempp circle , ” a group of auto executives headed by daimler-chrysler ceo jürgen schrempp which meets regularly to talk shop . but those warm feelings began to cool during schröder ’ s recent re-election campaign .
auto executives were unhappy with the chancellor ’ s stance on iraq and his outspoken opposition to us president george w. bush .
between 1998 and 2001 , audi , bmw , mercedes , porsche and vw watched their us market share rise from 6.6 to 9.3 percent and the carmakers did not want to see those numbers suffer due to fissures in german-american relations and perceptions of anti-americanism in germany . despite the criticism , the government shows no sign of budging on the company car issue .
finance minister hans eichel badly needs to compensate for budgetary shortfalls and he is hoping the tax hike will translate into an additional 500 million euro -lrb- $ 496 million -rrb- for the state ’ s strained coffers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german car maker bmw motors ahead despite an overall slump in the global automobile market , german car maker bmw has remained in good shape , and looks to surpass the million cars sold mark soon . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

they warn that proposed tax hikes on company cars could cost thousands of jobs . the german auto industry ’ s love affair with gerhard schröder has screeched to a halt in the wake of announced plans by the chancellor ’ s governing coalition to raise taxes on the private use of company cars by 50 percent . “ that not only affects the driver , but influences sales and jobs in the german automobile industry — in a negative way , ” wendelin wiedeking , head of porsche , said in a newspaper interview . according to the association of the german automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , some two million drivers of company cars will be affected by the tax hike , which will tax privately used company cars by 1.5 percent of the list price in the future .
the current rate is one percent . according to the vda , some 500,000 cars which are sold annually will meet the criteria for the new tax rate .
if leased vehicles are included , approximately 800,000 cars in total will be affected .
the automotive group says it fears the higher tax rate would mean more employees would reconsider using official cars for private use and as a result , fewer would be sold .
ferdinand dudenhöffer of the center of automotive research predicts sales could fall by some 150,000 cars annually . those that do choose to drive company cars , according to the vda , would forego size and luxury in their choice of automobiles , effectively “ downsizing ” so as to save on taxes . the result of all this , according to vda calculations , would be a sales downturn of some 2.6 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- annually and a possible loss of 10,000 jobs . “ car chancellor ” standing his ground the finance ministry has rejected the allegations , calling the gloomy predictions “ exaggerated . ”
the government is standing its ground on the issue , even though the powerful german automotive industry has traditionally had a considerable influence even at the highest levels of government . that is particularly true in the case of gerhard schröder , who even earned the nickname of “ car chancellor , ” due to the fact that he sat on the supervisory board of volkswagen , headquartered in his home state of north rhine-westphalia , and has always aggressively defended carmakers ' interests .
in general , the chancellor has enjoyed the good-will of many in the car industry , and was always a welcome guest in the “ schrempp circle , ” a group of auto executives headed by daimler-chrysler ceo jürgen schrempp which meets regularly to talk shop . but those warm feelings began to cool during schröder ’ s recent re-election campaign .
auto executives were unhappy with the chancellor ’ s stance on iraq and his outspoken opposition to us president george w. bush .
between 1998 and 2001 , audi , bmw , mercedes , porsche and vw watched their us market share rise from 6.6 to 9.3 percent and the carmakers did not want to see those numbers suffer due to fissures in german-american relations and perceptions of anti-americanism in germany . despite the criticism , the government shows no sign of budging on the company car issue .

non-existent growth , massive revenue shortfalls and eu disciplinary action all spell bad news for the sick man of europe . future german finance ministers , should they be feeling indulgent enough to peruse the records of their predecessors , may stumble across the date november 13 , 2002 , or , to put it more graphically , black wednesday .
that 's how bleak many observers are viewing wednesday 's release of economic data for germany that uniformly shows the country heading for a recession , and a prolonged one at that .
growth almost non-existent the so-called council of wise men , five independent experts who advise the government on economic policy offered very bad news on wednesday , warning that growth in europe 's largest economy next year would be just 1.0 percent at most .
the figure they issued for the current year was even gloomier , showing just 0.2 of growth .
their damning report also made it clear that most of germany 's economic problems were house-made and not a result of the global situation .
" the insufficient growth parameters in germany are largely due to the structural problems in this country , " the advisers said .
presenting a 20-point reform package , the council members stressed the paramount importance of a labor market restructure .
the key issue here , they said , was wage flexibility .
massive revenue shortfall according to estimates by the federal tax office , finance minister hans eichel is looking at a revenue shortfall for this year and next in the region of € 30 billion .
eichel has a reputation for being a cool customer and his reaction was a typical case of understatement : " the figures are disagreeable , " he was moved to say .
the grim outlook was echoed by the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , based in mannheim .
the institute 's monthly index of business expectations culled from surveys of financial analysts plunged by 19.2 percent for november to 4.2 percent .
speaking to dw-world , zew spokesman felix hüfner warned that worse was to come .
" growth is practically non-existent which is why we are expecting germany to enter into recession in the first half of next year , " he said .
he said the massive drop in sentiment was due to " grave uncertainties over the german economy and the stance of the european central bank over interest rate cuts . "
eu commission warns germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes presented germany with a formal warning over its budget deficit on wednesday .
as if that was n't bad enough , the european commission in brussels inflicted further pain on the sick man of europe also on wednesday by launching its so-called excessive deficit procedure , a formal alert for berlin to address its budget deficit .
the deficit is likely to reach 3.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and 3.2 percent in 2003 , exceeding the limit of 3.0 percent agreed under the stability and growth pact .
pedro solbes , the eu monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , said germany would have to act fast on its budget deficit in order to avoid further warnings .
this situation is particularly damaging and embarrassing for the german government , which , along with france , was the main proponent of enforcing strict budget rules to guarantee the euro 's stability .
chancellor gerhard schröder , outwardly cool , said he had no complaints about the decision .
" i can understand the position of the european commission , " he said at a press conference in berlin .
this plethora of devastating economic news means that finance minister eichel will be forced to introduce a supplementary budget for 2002 to account for the shortfall .
but critics are already saying that fiddling with a few fiscal policy tools will not do the trick .

in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals . we love animals , but we also kill them .
we cuddle them , but we also hunt them .
we revere them , but we also use them .
we mass produce livestock , we keep house pets , we go on luxury safaris and , at the same time , we protect endangered species .
the list of incredible contradictions in the relationship between humans and the animal kingdom seems endless and is now the focus of a new exhibit at the german hygiene museum in dresden titled , " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " .
the exhibit begins in a dimly-lit room .
loud speakers pipe out the sounds of many different types of animals .
hundreds of rubber animals are held in a case behind small adam and eve figures .
it 's clear from the beginning that the show 's creators have also infused a dose of humor into a provocative and deep subject .
tough moral questions " the exhibit is really about the self-image of humans , " says curator jasdan joerges .
" what 's so distinguishing about humans ?
what makes them human ?
who wears the crown of creation ?
will animals in the future need a bigger divide from humans ?
do we need new ethics for an animal of the future ?
these are the kinds of questions this exhibit deals with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals are a central component of human culture and civilization .
without them , we humans never would have become what we are today .
the first thematic block of the exhibit , under the title " beloved animals , " examines that motif .
the wide-reaching exhibit covers everything from hunting as an existential necessity to killing for sport , to the exotic menageries kept by european dynasties to today 's zoos , which have become the last refuges for some endangered species .
from the everyday to the bizarre the hygiene museum also devotes considerable space to examining the complex relationship between humans and their pets .
" the rank of house pets as a social and economic factor is enormous , " says joerges .
" it 's a billion euro industry .
we show everything here from jars from germany 's first blood bank for dogs to animal coffins to wedding dresses for dogs to fish-flavored toothpaste for cats to a model used to teach mouth-to-snout cpr . "
the show brings together more than 750 artifacts including paintings , films , stuffed animals and everyday objects .
it also includes its share of strange stuff , like a real elephant foot that was made into a trash can and given to former east german president wilhelm pieck on the occasion of his 80th birthday .
all of the exhibits are displayed behind a wire-netting fence , which is meant to symbolize the border between humans and animals .
a world divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " the fence is omnipresent in the first three sections of the exhibit , signifying how humans have tinkered with animals and sought to perfect certain species over thousands of years .
we 've used genetic engineering to add ribs in order to produce more meat cutlets and we 've devised technical equipment that guarantees the continued existence of breeding animals .
but it also leaves you asking yourself exactly the questions the curators intended .
how far should humans be able to go in their relationships with animals ?
should humans be able to experiment with animals that the latest scientific discoveries show share most of our genes ?
the exhibit does n't try to answer any of these questions - it merely poses them .
" man and animal " runs through august 10 , 2003 , at the deutsches hygiene museum , located at lingnerplatz 1 in dresden . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the german hygiene museum in dresden 9800 dw-tv europe live kick off !

non-existent growth , massive revenue shortfalls and eu disciplinary action all spell bad news for the sick man of europe . future german finance ministers , should they be feeling indulgent enough to peruse the records of their predecessors , may stumble across the date november 13 , 2002 , or , to put it more graphically , black wednesday .

growth almost non-existent the so-called council of wise men , five independent experts who advise the government on economic policy offered very bad news on wednesday , warning that growth in europe 's largest economy next year would be just 1.0 percent at most .

eu commission warns germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes presented germany with a formal warning over its budget deficit on wednesday .
as if that was n't bad enough , the european commission in brussels inflicted further pain on the sick man of europe also on wednesday by launching its so-called excessive deficit procedure , a formal alert for berlin to address its budget deficit .
the deficit is likely to reach 3.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and 3.2 percent in 2003 , exceeding the limit of 3.0 percent agreed under the stability and growth pact .
pedro solbes , the eu monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , said germany would have to act fast on its budget deficit in order to avoid further warnings .
this situation is particularly damaging and embarrassing for the german government , which , along with france , was the main proponent of enforcing strict budget rules to guarantee the euro 's stability .
chancellor gerhard schröder , outwardly cool , said he had no complaints about the decision .
" i can understand the position of the european commission , " he said at a press conference in berlin .
this plethora of devastating economic news means that finance minister eichel will be forced to introduce a supplementary budget for 2002 to account for the shortfall .

the deficit is likely to reach 3.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and 3.2 percent in 2003 , exceeding the limit of 3.0 percent agreed under the stability and growth pact .
pedro solbes , the eu monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , said germany would have to act fast on its budget deficit in order to avoid further warnings .
this situation is particularly damaging and embarrassing for the german government , which , along with france , was the main proponent of enforcing strict budget rules to guarantee the euro 's stability .
chancellor gerhard schröder , outwardly cool , said he had no complaints about the decision .
" i can understand the position of the european commission , " he said at a press conference in berlin .
this plethora of devastating economic news means that finance minister eichel will be forced to introduce a supplementary budget for 2002 to account for the shortfall .
but critics are already saying that fiddling with a few fiscal policy tools will not do the trick .
germany clearly has to address the fundamental , structural problems it has .
that will involve painful decisions , but then things ca n't really get any more painful than they already are . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules .

a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .
22 .
but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .
on nov .
13 , tax estimates were drastically revised downwards : the state would collect 31 billion euros less than planned .
then the government ’ s panel of economic experts said germany would most probably violate the eu ’ s deficit limit next year too , and brussels agreed and announced the start of formal disciplinary procedures . to cap it all off , the opposition , still smarting from its narrow defeat in the elections , accused the government of lying to voters . the slide from optimism to bleak pessimism has been extraordinarily rapid , and prospects seem to deteriorate by the day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2002 germany 's winter of discontent looms large großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much to smile about - german finance minister eichel businesses and financial institutions are preparing for the german economy to fall into a recession .
a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .
22 .
but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .
on nov .
13 , tax estimates were drastically revised downwards : the state would collect 31 billion euros less than planned .
then the government ’ s panel of economic experts said germany would most probably violate the eu ’ s deficit limit next year too , and brussels agreed and announced the start of formal disciplinary procedures . to cap it all off , the opposition , still smarting from its narrow defeat in the elections , accused the government of lying to voters . the slide from optimism to bleak pessimism has been extraordinarily rapid , and prospects seem to deteriorate by the day .
it ’ s probably no wonder that german businesses and financial institutions are taking a bleak view of the coming year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans face even leaner times falling in line with new imf projections released in early november , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery .
brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules .
german opposition parties call for parliamentary investigation a bitter battle has broken out between the german government and opposition parties over allegations the ruling coalition deceived the electorate over the state of the economy before the september election .

they warn that proposed tax hikes on company cars could cost thousands of jobs . the german auto industry ’ s love affair with gerhard schröder has screeched to a halt in the wake of announced plans by the chancellor ’ s governing coalition to raise taxes on the private use of company cars by 50 percent . “ that not only affects the driver , but influences sales and jobs in the german automobile industry — in a negative way , ” wendelin wiedeking , head of porsche , said in a newspaper interview . according to the association of the german automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , some two million drivers of company cars will be affected by the tax hike , which will tax privately used company cars by 1.5 percent of the list price in the future .
the current rate is one percent . according to the vda , some 500,000 cars which are sold annually will meet the criteria for the new tax rate .
if leased vehicles are included , approximately 800,000 cars in total will be affected .
the automotive group says it fears the higher tax rate would mean more employees would reconsider using official cars for private use and as a result , fewer would be sold .
ferdinand dudenhöffer of the center of automotive research predicts sales could fall by some 150,000 cars annually . those that do choose to drive company cars , according to the vda , would forego size and luxury in their choice of automobiles , effectively “ downsizing ” so as to save on taxes . the result of all this , according to vda calculations , would be a sales downturn of some 2.6 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- annually and a possible loss of 10,000 jobs . “ car chancellor ” standing his ground the finance ministry has rejected the allegations , calling the gloomy predictions “ exaggerated . ”

they warn that proposed tax hikes on company cars could cost thousands of jobs . the german auto industry ’ s love affair with gerhard schröder has screeched to a halt in the wake of announced plans by the chancellor ’ s governing coalition to raise taxes on the private use of company cars by 50 percent . “ that not only affects the driver , but influences sales and jobs in the german automobile industry — in a negative way , ” wendelin wiedeking , head of porsche , said in a newspaper interview . according to the association of the german automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , some two million drivers of company cars will be affected by the tax hike , which will tax privately used company cars by 1.5 percent of the list price in the future .

austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear . austria 's conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has emerged as the strongest political power after sunday 's general election .
with 42.3 percent of the vote , it will lead the country for the first time since 1966 . the landslide victory of the conservatives came as a surprise : pollsters had predicted that both the övp and the social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- would bring in roughly the same amount of votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the govenor of the austrian province carinthia rightist joerg haider from the freedom party puts his pooling card into the ballot box on sunday nov .
24 , 2002 in klagenfurt , austria .
-lrb- ap photo / gert eggenberger -rrb- more surprising still , jörg haider , the freedom party 's charismatic and controversial leader has announced his resignation as the governor of carinthia as a consequence of his party 's poor showing in the election .
the far-right fpö earned only 10.2 percent of the vote , losing two-thirds of its voters after bringing in 26.9 percent in 1999 .
the chaos and disarray in the fpö had forced chancellor schlüssel to call elections a year before the end of the legislative period in the first place .
it also brought his party its election victory ; analysts believe that increased support for the övp came from voters disenchanted with the fpö .
in september , fissures in the fpö turned into ruptures at the party convention in knitterfeld when the party broke into two wings : a more liberal wing supportive of then-party leader susanne riess-passer and the followers of the extreme anti-immigrant and anti-eu party founder , jörg haider .
four freedom party ministers , including riess-passer , resigned from the government . little choice for a junior partner spö party head alfred gusenbauer conceded defeat sunday evening .
the party did bring in 36.9 percent of voted -lrb- up 3.8 points from last election -rrb- , but thanks to the poor showing of the green party -lrb- 9.0 percent -rrb- , the social democrats wo n't be able to command a red-green government . gusenbauer confirmed that his party would not betray its campaign promises by entering into a coalition with the övp .
" our place is in the opposition , " he confirmed .
before the election gusenbauer had announced that if the spö came in second it would remain in the opposition . chancellor wolfgang schüssel has said that he will hold coalition talks with all three of the other leading parties . " we want to hold frank talks with all three parties .
nothing has been prearranged , " the chancellor told austrian television . but despite those assurances , another övp-fpö coalition seems likely .
on top of the social democrats ' rejection , green party leader alexander van der bellen has said no to forming a coalition with the conservatives . freedom party head herbert haupt , meanwhile , took responsibility for the fpö 's poor showing , while emphasizing that he hopes to remain in his position .
he also spoke out in favor of another övp-fpö coalition .
before the election the de facto party leader jörg haider had rejected the idea of his party entering into another government with the people 's party . european reactions the european press has largely welcomed the freedom party 's fall . the german daily süddeutsche zeitung comments that : " the fpö is one of the first unrestrictedly populist parties in europe that has been in the awkward position of having to realize its promises .
the result is its total lack of credibility . "
according to italy 's la repubblica , the election shows that " the wave of euro-populist xenophobia is on its way out of europe . " the dutch daily volkskrant looks at the balance for chancellor schüssel : " political observers believe that he consciously pursued a strategy to bring the freedom patty down a notch by giving it governmental responsibilities .
the election shows that he succeeded .
now schüssel can hold his head high when he meets his colleagues in europe or show them the finger . " at the same time , the spanish daily el pais writes that schüssel faces two unappetizing choices : another coalition with the freedom party , could end up with the fpö breaking up , leaving schüssel to face a stronger opposition without a majority .
a coalition with the social democrats , however , could cause the same situation that brought the far-right into the government in the first place .
more of the conservative status quo schüssel 's new government is likely to continue its aims to limit deficit spending , pursue liberalization and privatize state stakes in austrian companies .
the övp is also a strong supporter of eu enlargement . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .
jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .
far-right austrian leader faces uphill battle controversial austrian politician jörg haider has returned to lead his freedom party shortly ahead of new parliamentary elections .
but polls indicate the right-wingers wo n't repeat their success of three years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.11.2002 conservatives win big in austrian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schüssel defended his position as chancellor in austrian elections .
austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear . austria 's conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has emerged as the strongest political power after sunday 's general election .
with 42.3 percent of the vote , it will lead the country for the first time since 1966 . the landslide victory of the conservatives came as a surprise : pollsters had predicted that both the övp and the social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- would bring in roughly the same amount of votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the govenor of the austrian province carinthia rightist joerg haider from the freedom party puts his pooling card into the ballot box on sunday nov .
24 , 2002 in klagenfurt , austria .
-lrb- ap photo / gert eggenberger -rrb- more surprising still , jörg haider , the freedom party 's charismatic and controversial leader has announced his resignation as the governor of carinthia as a consequence of his party 's poor showing in the election .
the far-right fpö earned only 10.2 percent of the vote , losing two-thirds of its voters after bringing in 26.9 percent in 1999 .
the chaos and disarray in the fpö had forced chancellor schlüssel to call elections a year before the end of the legislative period in the first place .
it also brought his party its election victory ; analysts believe that increased support for the övp came from voters disenchanted with the fpö .

the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear . austria 's conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has emerged as the strongest political power after sunday 's general election .
with 42.3 percent of the vote , it will lead the country for the first time since 1966 . the landslide victory of the conservatives came as a surprise : pollsters had predicted that both the övp and the social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- would bring in roughly the same amount of votes .

berlin-based eco.carbon has developed a new material that could be used to soak up oil from spills like the tanker disaster in spain last week .
but the product has n't yet been tested on a wide scale . on nov .
19 , the oil tanker " prestige " broke apart and sank 250 kilometers off the coast of northern spain .
more than 70,000 metric tons of heavy oil threatens to leak into the atlantic and cause an environmental catastrophe and creating an enormous toxic mess to clean up .
the most common method of cleaning up after an oil spill is to erect barriers in the water and skim off the oil by hand .
but that only works in very calm seas .
british crews employ chemical cleaning agents , which are dropped from airplanes or boats directly onto the spill .
the oil then breaks down into tiny droplets , but the chemicals remain in the water and can kill fish and other marine life .
the " sponge " enter eco.carbon , a berlin-based company that has developed an alternative method for cleaning up oil spills .
eco.carbon has invented a giant sponge made of lignite resin that sucks up the oil , preventing it from harming the environment .
but that invention has yet to be tested under real conditions .
the material is water resistant , it does n't sink and it 's designed to absorb maximum amounts of oil .
the inside of the mat contains crushed coal , whose small granules can soak up especially large amounts of oil .
the process is safe and cheap .
the mats have so far withstood small-scale testing in pools of water with miniature oil slicks .
the berlin inventors have sold their invention mainly to disaster control teams and firefighters .
the scientists have a lot of confidence in their wonder weapon .
the mat method " we figure that you 'd need about 100 mats to collect a ton of oil from water , " says eco.carbon 's andreas jonas .
" the number of mats you need is n't determined by the size of the oil slick , but by the amount of oil spilled .
the mats do n't have to completely cover the oil spill . "
a unique advantage is that once the oil is absorbed into the mat , it remains fixed there permanently .
the downside , however , is that the mats become toxic waste .
even so , the inventors are convinced that their product will be a success - even on the high seas .
" the mats were tested for their effectiveness in water and we also tested to make sure that mats saturated with oil remained afloat for several days , " jonas says .
" we do n't think that the mats will go under in rough seas and that they will be able to stand up against huge waves . "
that would make using the mats more effective than clean-up methods currently in use and at just a third of the cost .
" to make the most effective use of the mats , large quantities would have to be able to reach the disaster scene , for example stranded ships , as quickly as possible , " says jonas .
" so it would be important for coast guards to maintain a supply of mats .
that is , depots should be set up along coastlines that are especially threatened so that the mats are readily available . "
fighting oil with bacteria but the scientists at eco.carbon are also trying to improve other methods to fight oil spills .
at the scenes of oil spills around the world , they 've found bacteria that seem to have an appetite for the toxic black sludge .
now , the scientists are breeding the bacteria .
the scientists are studying the different bacteria to determine which is most effective at reducing oil levels .
eventually , the hope to put the best bacteria to work in helping clean up after oil spill disasters .
but all of these efforts ca n't prevent the devastating environmental damage caused by the tanker accident .

in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals . we love animals , but we also kill them .
we cuddle them , but we also hunt them .
we revere them , but we also use them .
we mass produce livestock , we keep house pets , we go on luxury safaris and , at the same time , we protect endangered species .
the list of incredible contradictions in the relationship between humans and the animal kingdom seems endless and is now the focus of a new exhibit at the german hygiene museum in dresden titled , " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " .
the exhibit begins in a dimly-lit room .
loud speakers pipe out the sounds of many different types of animals .
hundreds of rubber animals are held in a case behind small adam and eve figures .
it 's clear from the beginning that the show 's creators have also infused a dose of humor into a provocative and deep subject .
tough moral questions " the exhibit is really about the self-image of humans , " says curator jasdan joerges .
" what 's so distinguishing about humans ?
what makes them human ?
who wears the crown of creation ?
will animals in the future need a bigger divide from humans ?
do we need new ethics for an animal of the future ?
these are the kinds of questions this exhibit deals with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals are a central component of human culture and civilization .
without them , we humans never would have become what we are today .

they warn that proposed tax hikes on company cars could cost thousands of jobs . the german auto industry ’ s love affair with gerhard schröder has screeched to a halt in the wake of announced plans by the chancellor ’ s governing coalition to raise taxes on the private use of company cars by 50 percent . “ that not only affects the driver , but influences sales and jobs in the german automobile industry — in a negative way , ” wendelin wiedeking , head of porsche , said in a newspaper interview . according to the association of the german automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , some two million drivers of company cars will be affected by the tax hike , which will tax privately used company cars by 1.5 percent of the list price in the future .
the current rate is one percent . according to the vda , some 500,000 cars which are sold annually will meet the criteria for the new tax rate .
if leased vehicles are included , approximately 800,000 cars in total will be affected .
the automotive group says it fears the higher tax rate would mean more employees would reconsider using official cars for private use and as a result , fewer would be sold .
ferdinand dudenhöffer of the center of automotive research predicts sales could fall by some 150,000 cars annually . those that do choose to drive company cars , according to the vda , would forego size and luxury in their choice of automobiles , effectively “ downsizing ” so as to save on taxes . the result of all this , according to vda calculations , would be a sales downturn of some 2.6 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- annually and a possible loss of 10,000 jobs . “ car chancellor ” standing his ground the finance ministry has rejected the allegations , calling the gloomy predictions “ exaggerated . ”
the government is standing its ground on the issue , even though the powerful german automotive industry has traditionally had a considerable influence even at the highest levels of government . that is particularly true in the case of gerhard schröder , who even earned the nickname of “ car chancellor , ” due to the fact that he sat on the supervisory board of volkswagen , headquartered in his home state of north rhine-westphalia , and has always aggressively defended carmakers ' interests .
in general , the chancellor has enjoyed the good-will of many in the car industry , and was always a welcome guest in the “ schrempp circle , ” a group of auto executives headed by daimler-chrysler ceo jürgen schrempp which meets regularly to talk shop . but those warm feelings began to cool during schröder ’ s recent re-election campaign .
auto executives were unhappy with the chancellor ’ s stance on iraq and his outspoken opposition to us president george w. bush .
between 1998 and 2001 , audi , bmw , mercedes , porsche and vw watched their us market share rise from 6.6 to 9.3 percent and the carmakers did not want to see those numbers suffer due to fissures in german-american relations and perceptions of anti-americanism in germany . despite the criticism , the government shows no sign of budging on the company car issue .

berlin-based eco.carbon has developed a new material that could be used to soak up oil from spills like the tanker disaster in spain last week .
but the product has n't yet been tested on a wide scale . on nov .
19 , the oil tanker " prestige " broke apart and sank 250 kilometers off the coast of northern spain .
more than 70,000 metric tons of heavy oil threatens to leak into the atlantic and cause an environmental catastrophe and creating an enormous toxic mess to clean up .
the most common method of cleaning up after an oil spill is to erect barriers in the water and skim off the oil by hand .
but that only works in very calm seas .
british crews employ chemical cleaning agents , which are dropped from airplanes or boats directly onto the spill .
the oil then breaks down into tiny droplets , but the chemicals remain in the water and can kill fish and other marine life .
the " sponge " enter eco.carbon , a berlin-based company that has developed an alternative method for cleaning up oil spills .
eco.carbon has invented a giant sponge made of lignite resin that sucks up the oil , preventing it from harming the environment .
but that invention has yet to be tested under real conditions .
the material is water resistant , it does n't sink and it 's designed to absorb maximum amounts of oil .
the inside of the mat contains crushed coal , whose small granules can soak up especially large amounts of oil .
the process is safe and cheap .
the mats have so far withstood small-scale testing in pools of water with miniature oil slicks .
the berlin inventors have sold their invention mainly to disaster control teams and firefighters .
the scientists have a lot of confidence in their wonder weapon .
the mat method " we figure that you 'd need about 100 mats to collect a ton of oil from water , " says eco.carbon 's andreas jonas .
" the number of mats you need is n't determined by the size of the oil slick , but by the amount of oil spilled .
the mats do n't have to completely cover the oil spill . "
a unique advantage is that once the oil is absorbed into the mat , it remains fixed there permanently .
the downside , however , is that the mats become toxic waste .
even so , the inventors are convinced that their product will be a success - even on the high seas .
" the mats were tested for their effectiveness in water and we also tested to make sure that mats saturated with oil remained afloat for several days , " jonas says .
" we do n't think that the mats will go under in rough seas and that they will be able to stand up against huge waves . "
that would make using the mats more effective than clean-up methods currently in use and at just a third of the cost .
" to make the most effective use of the mats , large quantities would have to be able to reach the disaster scene , for example stranded ships , as quickly as possible , " says jonas .
" so it would be important for coast guards to maintain a supply of mats .
that is , depots should be set up along coastlines that are especially threatened so that the mats are readily available . "
fighting oil with bacteria but the scientists at eco.carbon are also trying to improve other methods to fight oil spills .
at the scenes of oil spills around the world , they 've found bacteria that seem to have an appetite for the toxic black sludge .
now , the scientists are breeding the bacteria .
the scientists are studying the different bacteria to determine which is most effective at reducing oil levels .
eventually , the hope to put the best bacteria to work in helping clean up after oil spill disasters .
but all of these efforts ca n't prevent the devastating environmental damage caused by the tanker accident .

berlin-based eco.carbon has developed a new material that could be used to soak up oil from spills like the tanker disaster in spain last week .
but the product has n't yet been tested on a wide scale . on nov .
19 , the oil tanker " prestige " broke apart and sank 250 kilometers off the coast of northern spain .
more than 70,000 metric tons of heavy oil threatens to leak into the atlantic and cause an environmental catastrophe and creating an enormous toxic mess to clean up .
the most common method of cleaning up after an oil spill is to erect barriers in the water and skim off the oil by hand .
but that only works in very calm seas .
british crews employ chemical cleaning agents , which are dropped from airplanes or boats directly onto the spill .
the oil then breaks down into tiny droplets , but the chemicals remain in the water and can kill fish and other marine life .
the " sponge " enter eco.carbon , a berlin-based company that has developed an alternative method for cleaning up oil spills .
eco.carbon has invented a giant sponge made of lignite resin that sucks up the oil , preventing it from harming the environment .
but that invention has yet to be tested under real conditions .
the material is water resistant , it does n't sink and it 's designed to absorb maximum amounts of oil .
the inside of the mat contains crushed coal , whose small granules can soak up especially large amounts of oil .
the process is safe and cheap .
the mats have so far withstood small-scale testing in pools of water with miniature oil slicks .
the berlin inventors have sold their invention mainly to disaster control teams and firefighters .
the scientists have a lot of confidence in their wonder weapon .
the mat method " we figure that you 'd need about 100 mats to collect a ton of oil from water , " says eco.carbon 's andreas jonas .
" the number of mats you need is n't determined by the size of the oil slick , but by the amount of oil spilled .
the mats do n't have to completely cover the oil spill . "
a unique advantage is that once the oil is absorbed into the mat , it remains fixed there permanently .
the downside , however , is that the mats become toxic waste .
even so , the inventors are convinced that their product will be a success - even on the high seas .
" the mats were tested for their effectiveness in water and we also tested to make sure that mats saturated with oil remained afloat for several days , " jonas says .
" we do n't think that the mats will go under in rough seas and that they will be able to stand up against huge waves . "
that would make using the mats more effective than clean-up methods currently in use and at just a third of the cost .
" to make the most effective use of the mats , large quantities would have to be able to reach the disaster scene , for example stranded ships , as quickly as possible , " says jonas .
" so it would be important for coast guards to maintain a supply of mats .
that is , depots should be set up along coastlines that are especially threatened so that the mats are readily available . "
fighting oil with bacteria but the scientists at eco.carbon are also trying to improve other methods to fight oil spills .
at the scenes of oil spills around the world , they 've found bacteria that seem to have an appetite for the toxic black sludge .
now , the scientists are breeding the bacteria .
the scientists are studying the different bacteria to determine which is most effective at reducing oil levels .
eventually , the hope to put the best bacteria to work in helping clean up after oil spill disasters .
but all of these efforts ca n't prevent the devastating environmental damage caused by the tanker accident .

in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals . we love animals , but we also kill them .
we cuddle them , but we also hunt them .
we revere them , but we also use them .
we mass produce livestock , we keep house pets , we go on luxury safaris and , at the same time , we protect endangered species .
the list of incredible contradictions in the relationship between humans and the animal kingdom seems endless and is now the focus of a new exhibit at the german hygiene museum in dresden titled , " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " .
the exhibit begins in a dimly-lit room .
loud speakers pipe out the sounds of many different types of animals .
hundreds of rubber animals are held in a case behind small adam and eve figures .
it 's clear from the beginning that the show 's creators have also infused a dose of humor into a provocative and deep subject .
tough moral questions " the exhibit is really about the self-image of humans , " says curator jasdan joerges .
" what 's so distinguishing about humans ?
what makes them human ?
who wears the crown of creation ?
will animals in the future need a bigger divide from humans ?
do we need new ethics for an animal of the future ?
these are the kinds of questions this exhibit deals with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals are a central component of human culture and civilization .
without them , we humans never would have become what we are today .
the first thematic block of the exhibit , under the title " beloved animals , " examines that motif .
the wide-reaching exhibit covers everything from hunting as an existential necessity to killing for sport , to the exotic menageries kept by european dynasties to today 's zoos , which have become the last refuges for some endangered species .
from the everyday to the bizarre the hygiene museum also devotes considerable space to examining the complex relationship between humans and their pets .
" the rank of house pets as a social and economic factor is enormous , " says joerges .
" it 's a billion euro industry .
we show everything here from jars from germany 's first blood bank for dogs to animal coffins to wedding dresses for dogs to fish-flavored toothpaste for cats to a model used to teach mouth-to-snout cpr . "
the show brings together more than 750 artifacts including paintings , films , stuffed animals and everyday objects .
it also includes its share of strange stuff , like a real elephant foot that was made into a trash can and given to former east german president wilhelm pieck on the occasion of his 80th birthday .
all of the exhibits are displayed behind a wire-netting fence , which is meant to symbolize the border between humans and animals .
a world divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " the fence is omnipresent in the first three sections of the exhibit , signifying how humans have tinkered with animals and sought to perfect certain species over thousands of years .
we 've used genetic engineering to add ribs in order to produce more meat cutlets and we 've devised technical equipment that guarantees the continued existence of breeding animals .
but it also leaves you asking yourself exactly the questions the curators intended .
how far should humans be able to go in their relationships with animals ?
should humans be able to experiment with animals that the latest scientific discoveries show share most of our genes ?
the exhibit does n't try to answer any of these questions - it merely poses them .

austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear . austria 's conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has emerged as the strongest political power after sunday 's general election .
with 42.3 percent of the vote , it will lead the country for the first time since 1966 . the landslide victory of the conservatives came as a surprise : pollsters had predicted that both the övp and the social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- would bring in roughly the same amount of votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the govenor of the austrian province carinthia rightist joerg haider from the freedom party puts his pooling card into the ballot box on sunday nov .
24 , 2002 in klagenfurt , austria .
-lrb- ap photo / gert eggenberger -rrb- more surprising still , jörg haider , the freedom party 's charismatic and controversial leader has announced his resignation as the governor of carinthia as a consequence of his party 's poor showing in the election .
the far-right fpö earned only 10.2 percent of the vote , losing two-thirds of its voters after bringing in 26.9 percent in 1999 .
the chaos and disarray in the fpö had forced chancellor schlüssel to call elections a year before the end of the legislative period in the first place .
it also brought his party its election victory ; analysts believe that increased support for the övp came from voters disenchanted with the fpö .
in september , fissures in the fpö turned into ruptures at the party convention in knitterfeld when the party broke into two wings : a more liberal wing supportive of then-party leader susanne riess-passer and the followers of the extreme anti-immigrant and anti-eu party founder , jörg haider .
four freedom party ministers , including riess-passer , resigned from the government . little choice for a junior partner spö party head alfred gusenbauer conceded defeat sunday evening .
the party did bring in 36.9 percent of voted -lrb- up 3.8 points from last election -rrb- , but thanks to the poor showing of the green party -lrb- 9.0 percent -rrb- , the social democrats wo n't be able to command a red-green government . gusenbauer confirmed that his party would not betray its campaign promises by entering into a coalition with the övp .
" our place is in the opposition , " he confirmed .
before the election gusenbauer had announced that if the spö came in second it would remain in the opposition . chancellor wolfgang schüssel has said that he will hold coalition talks with all three of the other leading parties . " we want to hold frank talks with all three parties .
nothing has been prearranged , " the chancellor told austrian television . but despite those assurances , another övp-fpö coalition seems likely .
on top of the social democrats ' rejection , green party leader alexander van der bellen has said no to forming a coalition with the conservatives . freedom party head herbert haupt , meanwhile , took responsibility for the fpö 's poor showing , while emphasizing that he hopes to remain in his position .
he also spoke out in favor of another övp-fpö coalition .
before the election the de facto party leader jörg haider had rejected the idea of his party entering into another government with the people 's party . european reactions the european press has largely welcomed the freedom party 's fall . the german daily süddeutsche zeitung comments that : " the fpö is one of the first unrestrictedly populist parties in europe that has been in the awkward position of having to realize its promises .
the result is its total lack of credibility . "
according to italy 's la repubblica , the election shows that " the wave of euro-populist xenophobia is on its way out of europe . " the dutch daily volkskrant looks at the balance for chancellor schüssel : " political observers believe that he consciously pursued a strategy to bring the freedom patty down a notch by giving it governmental responsibilities .
the election shows that he succeeded .
now schüssel can hold his head high when he meets his colleagues in europe or show them the finger . " at the same time , the spanish daily el pais writes that schüssel faces two unappetizing choices : another coalition with the freedom party , could end up with the fpö breaking up , leaving schüssel to face a stronger opposition without a majority .
a coalition with the social democrats , however , could cause the same situation that brought the far-right into the government in the first place .

they warn that proposed tax hikes on company cars could cost thousands of jobs . the german auto industry ’ s love affair with gerhard schröder has screeched to a halt in the wake of announced plans by the chancellor ’ s governing coalition to raise taxes on the private use of company cars by 50 percent . “ that not only affects the driver , but influences sales and jobs in the german automobile industry — in a negative way , ” wendelin wiedeking , head of porsche , said in a newspaper interview . according to the association of the german automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , some two million drivers of company cars will be affected by the tax hike , which will tax privately used company cars by 1.5 percent of the list price in the future .
the current rate is one percent . according to the vda , some 500,000 cars which are sold annually will meet the criteria for the new tax rate .
if leased vehicles are included , approximately 800,000 cars in total will be affected .
the automotive group says it fears the higher tax rate would mean more employees would reconsider using official cars for private use and as a result , fewer would be sold .
ferdinand dudenhöffer of the center of automotive research predicts sales could fall by some 150,000 cars annually . those that do choose to drive company cars , according to the vda , would forego size and luxury in their choice of automobiles , effectively “ downsizing ” so as to save on taxes . the result of all this , according to vda calculations , would be a sales downturn of some 2.6 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- annually and a possible loss of 10,000 jobs . “ car chancellor ” standing his ground the finance ministry has rejected the allegations , calling the gloomy predictions “ exaggerated . ”
the government is standing its ground on the issue , even though the powerful german automotive industry has traditionally had a considerable influence even at the highest levels of government . that is particularly true in the case of gerhard schröder , who even earned the nickname of “ car chancellor , ” due to the fact that he sat on the supervisory board of volkswagen , headquartered in his home state of north rhine-westphalia , and has always aggressively defended carmakers ' interests .
in general , the chancellor has enjoyed the good-will of many in the car industry , and was always a welcome guest in the “ schrempp circle , ” a group of auto executives headed by daimler-chrysler ceo jürgen schrempp which meets regularly to talk shop . but those warm feelings began to cool during schröder ’ s recent re-election campaign .
auto executives were unhappy with the chancellor ’ s stance on iraq and his outspoken opposition to us president george w. bush .
between 1998 and 2001 , audi , bmw , mercedes , porsche and vw watched their us market share rise from 6.6 to 9.3 percent and the carmakers did not want to see those numbers suffer due to fissures in german-american relations and perceptions of anti-americanism in germany . despite the criticism , the government shows no sign of budging on the company car issue .
finance minister hans eichel badly needs to compensate for budgetary shortfalls and he is hoping the tax hike will translate into an additional 500 million euro -lrb- $ 496 million -rrb- for the state ’ s strained coffers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german car maker bmw motors ahead despite an overall slump in the global automobile market , german car maker bmw has remained in good shape , and looks to surpass the million cars sold mark soon .

a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .

but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .

contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .

a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .

a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2002 germany 's winter of discontent looms large großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much to smile about - german finance minister eichel businesses and financial institutions are preparing for the german economy to fall into a recession .
a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .
22 .
but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .

the government is standing its ground on the issue , even though the powerful german automotive industry has traditionally had a considerable influence even at the highest levels of government . that is particularly true in the case of gerhard schröder , who even earned the nickname of “ car chancellor , ” due to the fact that he sat on the supervisory board of volkswagen , headquartered in his home state of north rhine-westphalia , and has always aggressively defended carmakers ' interests .
in general , the chancellor has enjoyed the good-will of many in the car industry , and was always a welcome guest in the “ schrempp circle , ” a group of auto executives headed by daimler-chrysler ceo jürgen schrempp which meets regularly to talk shop . but those warm feelings began to cool during schröder ’ s recent re-election campaign .
auto executives were unhappy with the chancellor ’ s stance on iraq and his outspoken opposition to us president george w. bush .
between 1998 and 2001 , audi , bmw , mercedes , porsche and vw watched their us market share rise from 6.6 to 9.3 percent and the carmakers did not want to see those numbers suffer due to fissures in german-american relations and perceptions of anti-americanism in germany . despite the criticism , the government shows no sign of budging on the company car issue .
finance minister hans eichel badly needs to compensate for budgetary shortfalls and he is hoping the tax hike will translate into an additional 500 million euro -lrb- $ 496 million -rrb- for the state ’ s strained coffers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german car maker bmw motors ahead despite an overall slump in the global automobile market , german car maker bmw has remained in good shape , and looks to surpass the million cars sold mark soon .

non-existent growth , massive revenue shortfalls and eu disciplinary action all spell bad news for the sick man of europe . future german finance ministers , should they be feeling indulgent enough to peruse the records of their predecessors , may stumble across the date november 13 , 2002 , or , to put it more graphically , black wednesday .
that 's how bleak many observers are viewing wednesday 's release of economic data for germany that uniformly shows the country heading for a recession , and a prolonged one at that .
growth almost non-existent the so-called council of wise men , five independent experts who advise the government on economic policy offered very bad news on wednesday , warning that growth in europe 's largest economy next year would be just 1.0 percent at most .
the figure they issued for the current year was even gloomier , showing just 0.2 of growth .
their damning report also made it clear that most of germany 's economic problems were house-made and not a result of the global situation .
" the insufficient growth parameters in germany are largely due to the structural problems in this country , " the advisers said .
presenting a 20-point reform package , the council members stressed the paramount importance of a labor market restructure .
the key issue here , they said , was wage flexibility .
massive revenue shortfall according to estimates by the federal tax office , finance minister hans eichel is looking at a revenue shortfall for this year and next in the region of € 30 billion .
eichel has a reputation for being a cool customer and his reaction was a typical case of understatement : " the figures are disagreeable , " he was moved to say .
the grim outlook was echoed by the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , based in mannheim .
the institute 's monthly index of business expectations culled from surveys of financial analysts plunged by 19.2 percent for november to 4.2 percent .
speaking to dw-world , zew spokesman felix hüfner warned that worse was to come .
" growth is practically non-existent which is why we are expecting germany to enter into recession in the first half of next year , " he said .
he said the massive drop in sentiment was due to " grave uncertainties over the german economy and the stance of the european central bank over interest rate cuts . "
eu commission warns germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes presented germany with a formal warning over its budget deficit on wednesday .
as if that was n't bad enough , the european commission in brussels inflicted further pain on the sick man of europe also on wednesday by launching its so-called excessive deficit procedure , a formal alert for berlin to address its budget deficit .
the deficit is likely to reach 3.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and 3.2 percent in 2003 , exceeding the limit of 3.0 percent agreed under the stability and growth pact .
pedro solbes , the eu monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , said germany would have to act fast on its budget deficit in order to avoid further warnings .
this situation is particularly damaging and embarrassing for the german government , which , along with france , was the main proponent of enforcing strict budget rules to guarantee the euro 's stability .
chancellor gerhard schröder , outwardly cool , said he had no complaints about the decision .
" i can understand the position of the european commission , " he said at a press conference in berlin .
this plethora of devastating economic news means that finance minister eichel will be forced to introduce a supplementary budget for 2002 to account for the shortfall .
but critics are already saying that fiddling with a few fiscal policy tools will not do the trick .

non-existent growth , massive revenue shortfalls and eu disciplinary action all spell bad news for the sick man of europe . future german finance ministers , should they be feeling indulgent enough to peruse the records of their predecessors , may stumble across the date november 13 , 2002 , or , to put it more graphically , black wednesday .
that 's how bleak many observers are viewing wednesday 's release of economic data for germany that uniformly shows the country heading for a recession , and a prolonged one at that .
growth almost non-existent the so-called council of wise men , five independent experts who advise the government on economic policy offered very bad news on wednesday , warning that growth in europe 's largest economy next year would be just 1.0 percent at most .
the figure they issued for the current year was even gloomier , showing just 0.2 of growth .
their damning report also made it clear that most of germany 's economic problems were house-made and not a result of the global situation .
" the insufficient growth parameters in germany are largely due to the structural problems in this country , " the advisers said .
presenting a 20-point reform package , the council members stressed the paramount importance of a labor market restructure .
the key issue here , they said , was wage flexibility .
massive revenue shortfall according to estimates by the federal tax office , finance minister hans eichel is looking at a revenue shortfall for this year and next in the region of € 30 billion .
eichel has a reputation for being a cool customer and his reaction was a typical case of understatement : " the figures are disagreeable , " he was moved to say .
the grim outlook was echoed by the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , based in mannheim .
the institute 's monthly index of business expectations culled from surveys of financial analysts plunged by 19.2 percent for november to 4.2 percent .
speaking to dw-world , zew spokesman felix hüfner warned that worse was to come .
" growth is practically non-existent which is why we are expecting germany to enter into recession in the first half of next year , " he said .
he said the massive drop in sentiment was due to " grave uncertainties over the german economy and the stance of the european central bank over interest rate cuts . "
eu commission warns germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes presented germany with a formal warning over its budget deficit on wednesday .
as if that was n't bad enough , the european commission in brussels inflicted further pain on the sick man of europe also on wednesday by launching its so-called excessive deficit procedure , a formal alert for berlin to address its budget deficit .
the deficit is likely to reach 3.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and 3.2 percent in 2003 , exceeding the limit of 3.0 percent agreed under the stability and growth pact .
pedro solbes , the eu monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , said germany would have to act fast on its budget deficit in order to avoid further warnings .
this situation is particularly damaging and embarrassing for the german government , which , along with france , was the main proponent of enforcing strict budget rules to guarantee the euro 's stability .
chancellor gerhard schröder , outwardly cool , said he had no complaints about the decision .
" i can understand the position of the european commission , " he said at a press conference in berlin .
this plethora of devastating economic news means that finance minister eichel will be forced to introduce a supplementary budget for 2002 to account for the shortfall .
but critics are already saying that fiddling with a few fiscal policy tools will not do the trick .
germany clearly has to address the fundamental , structural problems it has .
that will involve painful decisions , but then things ca n't really get any more painful than they already are . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .

they warn that proposed tax hikes on company cars could cost thousands of jobs . the german auto industry ’ s love affair with gerhard schröder has screeched to a halt in the wake of announced plans by the chancellor ’ s governing coalition to raise taxes on the private use of company cars by 50 percent . “ that not only affects the driver , but influences sales and jobs in the german automobile industry — in a negative way , ” wendelin wiedeking , head of porsche , said in a newspaper interview . according to the association of the german automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , some two million drivers of company cars will be affected by the tax hike , which will tax privately used company cars by 1.5 percent of the list price in the future .
the current rate is one percent . according to the vda , some 500,000 cars which are sold annually will meet the criteria for the new tax rate .
if leased vehicles are included , approximately 800,000 cars in total will be affected .
the automotive group says it fears the higher tax rate would mean more employees would reconsider using official cars for private use and as a result , fewer would be sold .
ferdinand dudenhöffer of the center of automotive research predicts sales could fall by some 150,000 cars annually . those that do choose to drive company cars , according to the vda , would forego size and luxury in their choice of automobiles , effectively “ downsizing ” so as to save on taxes . the result of all this , according to vda calculations , would be a sales downturn of some 2.6 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- annually and a possible loss of 10,000 jobs . “ car chancellor ” standing his ground the finance ministry has rejected the allegations , calling the gloomy predictions “ exaggerated . ”
the government is standing its ground on the issue , even though the powerful german automotive industry has traditionally had a considerable influence even at the highest levels of government . that is particularly true in the case of gerhard schröder , who even earned the nickname of “ car chancellor , ” due to the fact that he sat on the supervisory board of volkswagen , headquartered in his home state of north rhine-westphalia , and has always aggressively defended carmakers ' interests .
in general , the chancellor has enjoyed the good-will of many in the car industry , and was always a welcome guest in the “ schrempp circle , ” a group of auto executives headed by daimler-chrysler ceo jürgen schrempp which meets regularly to talk shop . but those warm feelings began to cool during schröder ’ s recent re-election campaign .
auto executives were unhappy with the chancellor ’ s stance on iraq and his outspoken opposition to us president george w. bush .
between 1998 and 2001 , audi , bmw , mercedes , porsche and vw watched their us market share rise from 6.6 to 9.3 percent and the carmakers did not want to see those numbers suffer due to fissures in german-american relations and perceptions of anti-americanism in germany . despite the criticism , the government shows no sign of budging on the company car issue .
finance minister hans eichel badly needs to compensate for budgetary shortfalls and he is hoping the tax hike will translate into an additional 500 million euro -lrb- $ 496 million -rrb- for the state ’ s strained coffers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german car maker bmw motors ahead despite an overall slump in the global automobile market , german car maker bmw has remained in good shape , and looks to surpass the million cars sold mark soon .

a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .
22 .
but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .
on nov .
13 , tax estimates were drastically revised downwards : the state would collect 31 billion euros less than planned .
then the government ’ s panel of economic experts said germany would most probably violate the eu ’ s deficit limit next year too , and brussels agreed and announced the start of formal disciplinary procedures . to cap it all off , the opposition , still smarting from its narrow defeat in the elections , accused the government of lying to voters . the slide from optimism to bleak pessimism has been extraordinarily rapid , and prospects seem to deteriorate by the day .

a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .
22 .
but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .
on nov .
13 , tax estimates were drastically revised downwards : the state would collect 31 billion euros less than planned .
then the government ’ s panel of economic experts said germany would most probably violate the eu ’ s deficit limit next year too , and brussels agreed and announced the start of formal disciplinary procedures . to cap it all off , the opposition , still smarting from its narrow defeat in the elections , accused the government of lying to voters . the slide from optimism to bleak pessimism has been extraordinarily rapid , and prospects seem to deteriorate by the day .

sentenced to a jail term , professional activist and french farmer josé bové admits his guilt .
but he 's not willing to do time . his wife tends to the sheep .
josé bové , for many the public face of the anti-globalization movement , does n't have time for it .
and from a prison cell the frenchman with the bushy moustache wo n't be able to help her out much either . this week , france 's highest court threw out a bid to overturn two jail sentences that josé bové received for destroying thousands of genetically-modified plants in 1998 and 1999 .
the spokesman and co-founder of the leftist union farmers confederation claims that he and his cohorts were acting in self-defense - defense against the unknown dangers they believe gm foods present . attacking big business bové can expect to spend his 50th birthday in january behind bars .
he already did a six-week sentence earlier this year for ransacking a mcdonald 's construction site in the southern french town millau .

berlin-based eco.carbon has developed a new material that could be used to soak up oil from spills like the tanker disaster in spain last week .
but the product has n't yet been tested on a wide scale . on nov .
19 , the oil tanker " prestige " broke apart and sank 250 kilometers off the coast of northern spain .
more than 70,000 metric tons of heavy oil threatens to leak into the atlantic and cause an environmental catastrophe and creating an enormous toxic mess to clean up .
the most common method of cleaning up after an oil spill is to erect barriers in the water and skim off the oil by hand .
but that only works in very calm seas .
british crews employ chemical cleaning agents , which are dropped from airplanes or boats directly onto the spill .
the oil then breaks down into tiny droplets , but the chemicals remain in the water and can kill fish and other marine life .
the " sponge " enter eco.carbon , a berlin-based company that has developed an alternative method for cleaning up oil spills .
eco.carbon has invented a giant sponge made of lignite resin that sucks up the oil , preventing it from harming the environment .
but that invention has yet to be tested under real conditions .
the material is water resistant , it does n't sink and it 's designed to absorb maximum amounts of oil .
the inside of the mat contains crushed coal , whose small granules can soak up especially large amounts of oil .
the process is safe and cheap .
the mats have so far withstood small-scale testing in pools of water with miniature oil slicks .
the berlin inventors have sold their invention mainly to disaster control teams and firefighters .
the scientists have a lot of confidence in their wonder weapon .
the mat method " we figure that you 'd need about 100 mats to collect a ton of oil from water , " says eco.carbon 's andreas jonas .
" the number of mats you need is n't determined by the size of the oil slick , but by the amount of oil spilled .
the mats do n't have to completely cover the oil spill . "
a unique advantage is that once the oil is absorbed into the mat , it remains fixed there permanently .
the downside , however , is that the mats become toxic waste .
even so , the inventors are convinced that their product will be a success - even on the high seas .
" the mats were tested for their effectiveness in water and we also tested to make sure that mats saturated with oil remained afloat for several days , " jonas says .
" we do n't think that the mats will go under in rough seas and that they will be able to stand up against huge waves . "
that would make using the mats more effective than clean-up methods currently in use and at just a third of the cost .
" to make the most effective use of the mats , large quantities would have to be able to reach the disaster scene , for example stranded ships , as quickly as possible , " says jonas .
" so it would be important for coast guards to maintain a supply of mats .
that is , depots should be set up along coastlines that are especially threatened so that the mats are readily available . "
fighting oil with bacteria but the scientists at eco.carbon are also trying to improve other methods to fight oil spills .
at the scenes of oil spills around the world , they 've found bacteria that seem to have an appetite for the toxic black sludge .
now , the scientists are breeding the bacteria .
the scientists are studying the different bacteria to determine which is most effective at reducing oil levels .
eventually , the hope to put the best bacteria to work in helping clean up after oil spill disasters .
but all of these efforts ca n't prevent the devastating environmental damage caused by the tanker accident .
if the prestige were now to lose the remaining 65,000 tons of its cargo , little could be done to prevent the environmental catastrophe awaiting the spanish coastline . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals . we love animals , but we also kill them .
we cuddle them , but we also hunt them .
we revere them , but we also use them .
we mass produce livestock , we keep house pets , we go on luxury safaris and , at the same time , we protect endangered species .
the list of incredible contradictions in the relationship between humans and the animal kingdom seems endless and is now the focus of a new exhibit at the german hygiene museum in dresden titled , " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " .
the exhibit begins in a dimly-lit room .
loud speakers pipe out the sounds of many different types of animals .
hundreds of rubber animals are held in a case behind small adam and eve figures .
it 's clear from the beginning that the show 's creators have also infused a dose of humor into a provocative and deep subject .
tough moral questions " the exhibit is really about the self-image of humans , " says curator jasdan joerges .
" what 's so distinguishing about humans ?
what makes them human ?
who wears the crown of creation ?
will animals in the future need a bigger divide from humans ?
do we need new ethics for an animal of the future ?
these are the kinds of questions this exhibit deals with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals are a central component of human culture and civilization .
without them , we humans never would have become what we are today .
the first thematic block of the exhibit , under the title " beloved animals , " examines that motif .
the wide-reaching exhibit covers everything from hunting as an existential necessity to killing for sport , to the exotic menageries kept by european dynasties to today 's zoos , which have become the last refuges for some endangered species .
from the everyday to the bizarre the hygiene museum also devotes considerable space to examining the complex relationship between humans and their pets .
" the rank of house pets as a social and economic factor is enormous , " says joerges .
" it 's a billion euro industry .
we show everything here from jars from germany 's first blood bank for dogs to animal coffins to wedding dresses for dogs to fish-flavored toothpaste for cats to a model used to teach mouth-to-snout cpr . "
the show brings together more than 750 artifacts including paintings , films , stuffed animals and everyday objects .
it also includes its share of strange stuff , like a real elephant foot that was made into a trash can and given to former east german president wilhelm pieck on the occasion of his 80th birthday .
all of the exhibits are displayed behind a wire-netting fence , which is meant to symbolize the border between humans and animals .
a world divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " the fence is omnipresent in the first three sections of the exhibit , signifying how humans have tinkered with animals and sought to perfect certain species over thousands of years .
we 've used genetic engineering to add ribs in order to produce more meat cutlets and we 've devised technical equipment that guarantees the continued existence of breeding animals .
but it also leaves you asking yourself exactly the questions the curators intended .
how far should humans be able to go in their relationships with animals ?
should humans be able to experiment with animals that the latest scientific discoveries show share most of our genes ?

austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear . austria 's conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has emerged as the strongest political power after sunday 's general election .
with 42.3 percent of the vote , it will lead the country for the first time since 1966 . the landslide victory of the conservatives came as a surprise : pollsters had predicted that both the övp and the social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- would bring in roughly the same amount of votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the govenor of the austrian province carinthia rightist joerg haider from the freedom party puts his pooling card into the ballot box on sunday nov .

-lrb- ap photo / gert eggenberger -rrb- more surprising still , jörg haider , the freedom party 's charismatic and controversial leader has announced his resignation as the governor of carinthia as a consequence of his party 's poor showing in the election .
the far-right fpö earned only 10.2 percent of the vote , losing two-thirds of its voters after bringing in 26.9 percent in 1999 .
the chaos and disarray in the fpö had forced chancellor schlüssel to call elections a year before the end of the legislative period in the first place .
it also brought his party its election victory ; analysts believe that increased support for the övp came from voters disenchanted with the fpö .
in september , fissures in the fpö turned into ruptures at the party convention in knitterfeld when the party broke into two wings : a more liberal wing supportive of then-party leader susanne riess-passer and the followers of the extreme anti-immigrant and anti-eu party founder , jörg haider .
four freedom party ministers , including riess-passer , resigned from the government . little choice for a junior partner spö party head alfred gusenbauer conceded defeat sunday evening .
the party did bring in 36.9 percent of voted -lrb- up 3.8 points from last election -rrb- , but thanks to the poor showing of the green party -lrb- 9.0 percent -rrb- , the social democrats wo n't be able to command a red-green government . gusenbauer confirmed that his party would not betray its campaign promises by entering into a coalition with the övp .
" our place is in the opposition , " he confirmed .
before the election gusenbauer had announced that if the spö came in second it would remain in the opposition . chancellor wolfgang schüssel has said that he will hold coalition talks with all three of the other leading parties . " we want to hold frank talks with all three parties .
nothing has been prearranged , " the chancellor told austrian television . but despite those assurances , another övp-fpö coalition seems likely .
on top of the social democrats ' rejection , green party leader alexander van der bellen has said no to forming a coalition with the conservatives . freedom party head herbert haupt , meanwhile , took responsibility for the fpö 's poor showing , while emphasizing that he hopes to remain in his position .
he also spoke out in favor of another övp-fpö coalition .
before the election the de facto party leader jörg haider had rejected the idea of his party entering into another government with the people 's party . european reactions the european press has largely welcomed the freedom party 's fall . the german daily süddeutsche zeitung comments that : " the fpö is one of the first unrestrictedly populist parties in europe that has been in the awkward position of having to realize its promises .
the result is its total lack of credibility . "
according to italy 's la repubblica , the election shows that " the wave of euro-populist xenophobia is on its way out of europe . " the dutch daily volkskrant looks at the balance for chancellor schüssel : " political observers believe that he consciously pursued a strategy to bring the freedom patty down a notch by giving it governmental responsibilities .
the election shows that he succeeded .
now schüssel can hold his head high when he meets his colleagues in europe or show them the finger . " at the same time , the spanish daily el pais writes that schüssel faces two unappetizing choices : another coalition with the freedom party , could end up with the fpö breaking up , leaving schüssel to face a stronger opposition without a majority .
a coalition with the social democrats , however , could cause the same situation that brought the far-right into the government in the first place .
more of the conservative status quo schüssel 's new government is likely to continue its aims to limit deficit spending , pursue liberalization and privatize state stakes in austrian companies .

jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .

non-existent growth , massive revenue shortfalls and eu disciplinary action all spell bad news for the sick man of europe . future german finance ministers , should they be feeling indulgent enough to peruse the records of their predecessors , may stumble across the date november 13 , 2002 , or , to put it more graphically , black wednesday .
that 's how bleak many observers are viewing wednesday 's release of economic data for germany that uniformly shows the country heading for a recession , and a prolonged one at that .
growth almost non-existent the so-called council of wise men , five independent experts who advise the government on economic policy offered very bad news on wednesday , warning that growth in europe 's largest economy next year would be just 1.0 percent at most .
the figure they issued for the current year was even gloomier , showing just 0.2 of growth .
their damning report also made it clear that most of germany 's economic problems were house-made and not a result of the global situation .

the grim outlook was echoed by the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , based in mannheim .
the institute 's monthly index of business expectations culled from surveys of financial analysts plunged by 19.2 percent for november to 4.2 percent .
speaking to dw-world , zew spokesman felix hüfner warned that worse was to come .
" growth is practically non-existent which is why we are expecting germany to enter into recession in the first half of next year , " he said .
he said the massive drop in sentiment was due to " grave uncertainties over the german economy and the stance of the european central bank over interest rate cuts . "

as if that was n't bad enough , the european commission in brussels inflicted further pain on the sick man of europe also on wednesday by launching its so-called excessive deficit procedure , a formal alert for berlin to address its budget deficit .
the deficit is likely to reach 3.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and 3.2 percent in 2003 , exceeding the limit of 3.0 percent agreed under the stability and growth pact .
pedro solbes , the eu monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , said germany would have to act fast on its budget deficit in order to avoid further warnings .
this situation is particularly damaging and embarrassing for the german government , which , along with france , was the main proponent of enforcing strict budget rules to guarantee the euro 's stability .
chancellor gerhard schröder , outwardly cool , said he had no complaints about the decision .
" i can understand the position of the european commission , " he said at a press conference in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2002 germany 's winter of discontent looms large großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much to smile about - german finance minister eichel businesses and financial institutions are preparing for the german economy to fall into a recession .
a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .
22 .
but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .

13 , tax estimates were drastically revised downwards : the state would collect 31 billion euros less than planned .
then the government ’ s panel of economic experts said germany would most probably violate the eu ’ s deficit limit next year too , and brussels agreed and announced the start of formal disciplinary procedures . to cap it all off , the opposition , still smarting from its narrow defeat in the elections , accused the government of lying to voters . the slide from optimism to bleak pessimism has been extraordinarily rapid , and prospects seem to deteriorate by the day .

a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .

but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .

but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .
on nov .
13 , tax estimates were drastically revised downwards : the state would collect 31 billion euros less than planned .
then the government ’ s panel of economic experts said germany would most probably violate the eu ’ s deficit limit next year too , and brussels agreed and announced the start of formal disciplinary procedures . to cap it all off , the opposition , still smarting from its narrow defeat in the elections , accused the government of lying to voters . the slide from optimism to bleak pessimism has been extraordinarily rapid , and prospects seem to deteriorate by the day .

eu commission warns germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes presented germany with a formal warning over its budget deficit on wednesday .
as if that was n't bad enough , the european commission in brussels inflicted further pain on the sick man of europe also on wednesday by launching its so-called excessive deficit procedure , a formal alert for berlin to address its budget deficit .
the deficit is likely to reach 3.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and 3.2 percent in 2003 , exceeding the limit of 3.0 percent agreed under the stability and growth pact .

in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals . we love animals , but we also kill them .
we cuddle them , but we also hunt them .
we revere them , but we also use them .
we mass produce livestock , we keep house pets , we go on luxury safaris and , at the same time , we protect endangered species .
the list of incredible contradictions in the relationship between humans and the animal kingdom seems endless and is now the focus of a new exhibit at the german hygiene museum in dresden titled , " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " .
the exhibit begins in a dimly-lit room .
loud speakers pipe out the sounds of many different types of animals .
hundreds of rubber animals are held in a case behind small adam and eve figures .
it 's clear from the beginning that the show 's creators have also infused a dose of humor into a provocative and deep subject .
tough moral questions " the exhibit is really about the self-image of humans , " says curator jasdan joerges .
" what 's so distinguishing about humans ?
what makes them human ?
who wears the crown of creation ?
will animals in the future need a bigger divide from humans ?
do we need new ethics for an animal of the future ?
these are the kinds of questions this exhibit deals with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals are a central component of human culture and civilization .
without them , we humans never would have become what we are today .
the first thematic block of the exhibit , under the title " beloved animals , " examines that motif .
the wide-reaching exhibit covers everything from hunting as an existential necessity to killing for sport , to the exotic menageries kept by european dynasties to today 's zoos , which have become the last refuges for some endangered species .
from the everyday to the bizarre the hygiene museum also devotes considerable space to examining the complex relationship between humans and their pets .
" the rank of house pets as a social and economic factor is enormous , " says joerges .
" it 's a billion euro industry .
we show everything here from jars from germany 's first blood bank for dogs to animal coffins to wedding dresses for dogs to fish-flavored toothpaste for cats to a model used to teach mouth-to-snout cpr . "
the show brings together more than 750 artifacts including paintings , films , stuffed animals and everyday objects .
it also includes its share of strange stuff , like a real elephant foot that was made into a trash can and given to former east german president wilhelm pieck on the occasion of his 80th birthday .
all of the exhibits are displayed behind a wire-netting fence , which is meant to symbolize the border between humans and animals .
a world divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " the fence is omnipresent in the first three sections of the exhibit , signifying how humans have tinkered with animals and sought to perfect certain species over thousands of years .
we 've used genetic engineering to add ribs in order to produce more meat cutlets and we 've devised technical equipment that guarantees the continued existence of breeding animals .
but it also leaves you asking yourself exactly the questions the curators intended .
how far should humans be able to go in their relationships with animals ?
should humans be able to experiment with animals that the latest scientific discoveries show share most of our genes ?

growth almost non-existent the so-called council of wise men , five independent experts who advise the government on economic policy offered very bad news on wednesday , warning that growth in europe 's largest economy next year would be just 1.0 percent at most .

a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .
22 .
but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .
on nov .
13 , tax estimates were drastically revised downwards : the state would collect 31 billion euros less than planned .
then the government ’ s panel of economic experts said germany would most probably violate the eu ’ s deficit limit next year too , and brussels agreed and announced the start of formal disciplinary procedures . to cap it all off , the opposition , still smarting from its narrow defeat in the elections , accused the government of lying to voters . the slide from optimism to bleak pessimism has been extraordinarily rapid , and prospects seem to deteriorate by the day .

a growing number of economists say gerhard schröder 's policies in the past year have fueled the problem . germany could drift into a recession this winter .
that ’ s the opinion of a number of economists at leading german financial institutions surveyed this week by the german-language edition of the " financial times . "
" we ’ ll go into recession at the end of the year , " holger schmiedling , chief european economist for bank of america , told the " financial times deutschland . "
other financial institutions , including deutsche bank , also expect economic growth in germany to drop in the current and the coming quarters .
hsbc trinkaus und burkhardt ’ s lothar hessler is even less optimistic .
“ a double dip is a realistic scenario , ” he says , referring to the situation where two recessive phases quickly follow one another . until recently , most economists were talking about negligible growth , or even stagnation , but not a full-blown recession .
however , the new forecasts support what business climate indicators such as that put out by the munich-based economic research institute ifo have been saying for months .
the forecasts are compounded by a report this week from the organization for economic cooperation and development predicting disappointing growth of 1.5 percent in germany next year . businesses put blame on government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , believes the country is in its worst economic state of the past two decades .
“ for two years running , economic growth has had a zero before the decimal point , ” he said in berlin on wednesday . hundt rejects the government ’ s attempts to deal with the situation as “ inconsistent and contradictory ” and lays the blame for the downturn squarely at the social democrat-greens coalition ’ s door .
this view is supported by many economic experts . both hsbc ’ s lothar hessler and gerd hassel from the ing bhf-bank single out the latest tax and welfare hikes , high unemployment and even the threat of a war against iraq as undermining consumer confidence .
an increase in consumer spending is seen as vital to economic recovery . they now expect the federal audit office to revise its figures for the first half of 2002 downwards when it presents its third quarter figures next week .
given the statistical importance of the first two quarters in drawing up the figures for the whole year , that would put total growth for the year well under the government ’ s forecast of 0.5 percent . so what happened ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in grimma the present mood of doom and gloom is in stark contrast to the government ’ s optimism at the beginning of 2002 .
the inflationary effect of the euro , the federal labor office scandal , the floods in eastern and southern germany , september ’ s narrow election result , and the news that the country ’ s budget deficit would violate european union regulations all signalled a bad year for german business .
it was made worse by the economy ’ s stubborn refusal to pick up again in compliance with the finance minister hans eichel ’ s predictions . eichel ’ s declared intention of doing away with new government debt by 2005 was played up in the news as the eu was preparing to issue a warning to berlin that it was in danger of exceeding the permissable budget deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of the year .
although germany managed to avoid the infamous “ blue letter , ” in the end the warnings turned out to be well-founded . consumers : euro = higher prices whereas the experts were trying to raise the alarm about the german economy , german consumers were getting in a lather over rising prices . even government surveys were unable to allay the public ’ s suspicion that retailers and services were using the conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro to fill their own tills . retailers began to worry about falling sales .
“ the consumer is pessimistic , anxious and despondent , ” german retailers association chairman hermann franzen said in the summer .
“ he ’ s worried about his future and unhappily frightened into intertia by negative reports in the press .
he only buys what he needs , not what he likes or wants . ”
but franzen also pointed out that germans had earned more than ever in the first half of 2002 ; they just weren ’ t spending it . the insolvable problem of the labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's local employment offices unemployment was another major issue over the last 11 months .
the discovery that the federal labor office was cooking its own books to give the impression it was getting more people back to work than was actually the case forced the government to take hasty action . the first thing the government did was increase the proportion of labor office employees involved in finding people work .
until that point , only ten percent of the roughly 90,000 public servants working there were actually doing that . a commission to devise ways of reforming the labor markets was then set up under the direction of volkswagen chairman peter hartz .
it set itself the goal of halving unemployment in germany by 2005 .
but the opposition christian democrats ’ parliamentary leader , friedrich merz , seemed to sum up the public ’ s dissatisfaction when he said , " there ’ s never ... been so much hot air about economic policy as under your government .
but it hasn ’ t resulted in any movement or new jobs .
no , just in a new commission . ” a close-run thing the opposition made unemployment one of the pillars of its election platform .
but the disastrous floods which struck the eastern states particularly badly during the summer gave the chancellor the chance to seize the initiative . wading through stricken villages in rubber boots , schröder seemed to be the epitome of the mover and shaker who gets things done .
but the cost of repairing the damage meant that tax reforms intended to ease the burden on both employees and businesses had to be postponed . nevertheless , the floods , together with the chancellor ’ s persistent opposition to military action against iraq , gave the red-green coalition the edge it needed to squeeze back into power on sept .
22 .
but , at the subsequent coalition negotiations , the uncomfortable truth started to come to light : the 2003 budget was full of holes . new government gets off to a bad start the coalition negotiations were acrimonious .
eventually the greens agreed to increases in taxes and surcharges and cuts in allowances to try to drum up the missing money .
contributions to the state pension fund were also increased . “ we hadn ’ t expected things to be so bad , ” said martin wansleben , chief executive of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce .
“ it signals a certain confusion and , at the moment , also a bit of desperation .
the coalition agreement is economic madness and is focussed only on the year 2003 .
germany will lose its growth potential if that ’ s all the government ’ s got to offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . ” no light at the end of the tunnel so far but it wasn ’ t the end of eichel ’ s torment .

they warn that proposed tax hikes on company cars could cost thousands of jobs . the german auto industry ’ s love affair with gerhard schröder has screeched to a halt in the wake of announced plans by the chancellor ’ s governing coalition to raise taxes on the private use of company cars by 50 percent . “ that not only affects the driver , but influences sales and jobs in the german automobile industry — in a negative way , ” wendelin wiedeking , head of porsche , said in a newspaper interview . according to the association of the german automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , some two million drivers of company cars will be affected by the tax hike , which will tax privately used company cars by 1.5 percent of the list price in the future .

they warn that proposed tax hikes on company cars could cost thousands of jobs . the german auto industry ’ s love affair with gerhard schröder has screeched to a halt in the wake of announced plans by the chancellor ’ s governing coalition to raise taxes on the private use of company cars by 50 percent . “ that not only affects the driver , but influences sales and jobs in the german automobile industry — in a negative way , ” wendelin wiedeking , head of porsche , said in a newspaper interview . according to the association of the german automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , some two million drivers of company cars will be affected by the tax hike , which will tax privately used company cars by 1.5 percent of the list price in the future .
the current rate is one percent . according to the vda , some 500,000 cars which are sold annually will meet the criteria for the new tax rate .
if leased vehicles are included , approximately 800,000 cars in total will be affected .
the automotive group says it fears the higher tax rate would mean more employees would reconsider using official cars for private use and as a result , fewer would be sold .
ferdinand dudenhöffer of the center of automotive research predicts sales could fall by some 150,000 cars annually . those that do choose to drive company cars , according to the vda , would forego size and luxury in their choice of automobiles , effectively “ downsizing ” so as to save on taxes . the result of all this , according to vda calculations , would be a sales downturn of some 2.6 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- annually and a possible loss of 10,000 jobs . “ car chancellor ” standing his ground the finance ministry has rejected the allegations , calling the gloomy predictions “ exaggerated . ”
the government is standing its ground on the issue , even though the powerful german automotive industry has traditionally had a considerable influence even at the highest levels of government . that is particularly true in the case of gerhard schröder , who even earned the nickname of “ car chancellor , ” due to the fact that he sat on the supervisory board of volkswagen , headquartered in his home state of north rhine-westphalia , and has always aggressively defended carmakers ' interests .
in general , the chancellor has enjoyed the good-will of many in the car industry , and was always a welcome guest in the “ schrempp circle , ” a group of auto executives headed by daimler-chrysler ceo jürgen schrempp which meets regularly to talk shop . but those warm feelings began to cool during schröder ’ s recent re-election campaign .
auto executives were unhappy with the chancellor ’ s stance on iraq and his outspoken opposition to us president george w. bush .
between 1998 and 2001 , audi , bmw , mercedes , porsche and vw watched their us market share rise from 6.6 to 9.3 percent and the carmakers did not want to see those numbers suffer due to fissures in german-american relations and perceptions of anti-americanism in germany . despite the criticism , the government shows no sign of budging on the company car issue .

austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear . austria 's conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has emerged as the strongest political power after sunday 's general election .
with 42.3 percent of the vote , it will lead the country for the first time since 1966 . the landslide victory of the conservatives came as a surprise : pollsters had predicted that both the övp and the social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- would bring in roughly the same amount of votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the govenor of the austrian province carinthia rightist joerg haider from the freedom party puts his pooling card into the ballot box on sunday nov .
24 , 2002 in klagenfurt , austria .
-lrb- ap photo / gert eggenberger -rrb- more surprising still , jörg haider , the freedom party 's charismatic and controversial leader has announced his resignation as the governor of carinthia as a consequence of his party 's poor showing in the election .
the far-right fpö earned only 10.2 percent of the vote , losing two-thirds of its voters after bringing in 26.9 percent in 1999 .
the chaos and disarray in the fpö had forced chancellor schlüssel to call elections a year before the end of the legislative period in the first place .
it also brought his party its election victory ; analysts believe that increased support for the övp came from voters disenchanted with the fpö .
in september , fissures in the fpö turned into ruptures at the party convention in knitterfeld when the party broke into two wings : a more liberal wing supportive of then-party leader susanne riess-passer and the followers of the extreme anti-immigrant and anti-eu party founder , jörg haider .
four freedom party ministers , including riess-passer , resigned from the government . little choice for a junior partner spö party head alfred gusenbauer conceded defeat sunday evening .
the party did bring in 36.9 percent of voted -lrb- up 3.8 points from last election -rrb- , but thanks to the poor showing of the green party -lrb- 9.0 percent -rrb- , the social democrats wo n't be able to command a red-green government . gusenbauer confirmed that his party would not betray its campaign promises by entering into a coalition with the övp .
" our place is in the opposition , " he confirmed .
before the election gusenbauer had announced that if the spö came in second it would remain in the opposition . chancellor wolfgang schüssel has said that he will hold coalition talks with all three of the other leading parties . " we want to hold frank talks with all three parties .
nothing has been prearranged , " the chancellor told austrian television . but despite those assurances , another övp-fpö coalition seems likely .
on top of the social democrats ' rejection , green party leader alexander van der bellen has said no to forming a coalition with the conservatives . freedom party head herbert haupt , meanwhile , took responsibility for the fpö 's poor showing , while emphasizing that he hopes to remain in his position .
he also spoke out in favor of another övp-fpö coalition .
before the election the de facto party leader jörg haider had rejected the idea of his party entering into another government with the people 's party . european reactions the european press has largely welcomed the freedom party 's fall . the german daily süddeutsche zeitung comments that : " the fpö is one of the first unrestrictedly populist parties in europe that has been in the awkward position of having to realize its promises .
the result is its total lack of credibility . "
according to italy 's la repubblica , the election shows that " the wave of euro-populist xenophobia is on its way out of europe . " the dutch daily volkskrant looks at the balance for chancellor schüssel : " political observers believe that he consciously pursued a strategy to bring the freedom patty down a notch by giving it governmental responsibilities .
the election shows that he succeeded .
now schüssel can hold his head high when he meets his colleagues in europe or show them the finger . " at the same time , the spanish daily el pais writes that schüssel faces two unappetizing choices : another coalition with the freedom party , could end up with the fpö breaking up , leaving schüssel to face a stronger opposition without a majority .
a coalition with the social democrats , however , could cause the same situation that brought the far-right into the government in the first place .
more of the conservative status quo schüssel 's new government is likely to continue its aims to limit deficit spending , pursue liberalization and privatize state stakes in austrian companies .

jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck .

austrian chancellor schüssel begins coalition talks today after his party won its biggest election victory in decades .
the fate of the far-right freedom party , which suffered a crushing defeat , is still unclear . austria 's conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has emerged as the strongest political power after sunday 's general election .
with 42.3 percent of the vote , it will lead the country for the first time since 1966 . the landslide victory of the conservatives came as a surprise : pollsters had predicted that both the övp and the social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- would bring in roughly the same amount of votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the govenor of the austrian province carinthia rightist joerg haider from the freedom party puts his pooling card into the ballot box on sunday nov .
24 , 2002 in klagenfurt , austria .
-lrb- ap photo / gert eggenberger -rrb- more surprising still , jörg haider , the freedom party 's charismatic and controversial leader has announced his resignation as the governor of carinthia as a consequence of his party 's poor showing in the election .
the far-right fpö earned only 10.2 percent of the vote , losing two-thirds of its voters after bringing in 26.9 percent in 1999 .
the chaos and disarray in the fpö had forced chancellor schlüssel to call elections a year before the end of the legislative period in the first place .
it also brought his party its election victory ; analysts believe that increased support for the övp came from voters disenchanted with the fpö .
in september , fissures in the fpö turned into ruptures at the party convention in knitterfeld when the party broke into two wings : a more liberal wing supportive of then-party leader susanne riess-passer and the followers of the extreme anti-immigrant and anti-eu party founder , jörg haider .
four freedom party ministers , including riess-passer , resigned from the government . little choice for a junior partner spö party head alfred gusenbauer conceded defeat sunday evening .
the party did bring in 36.9 percent of voted -lrb- up 3.8 points from last election -rrb- , but thanks to the poor showing of the green party -lrb- 9.0 percent -rrb- , the social democrats wo n't be able to command a red-green government . gusenbauer confirmed that his party would not betray its campaign promises by entering into a coalition with the övp .
" our place is in the opposition , " he confirmed .
before the election gusenbauer had announced that if the spö came in second it would remain in the opposition . chancellor wolfgang schüssel has said that he will hold coalition talks with all three of the other leading parties . " we want to hold frank talks with all three parties .
nothing has been prearranged , " the chancellor told austrian television . but despite those assurances , another övp-fpö coalition seems likely .
on top of the social democrats ' rejection , green party leader alexander van der bellen has said no to forming a coalition with the conservatives . freedom party head herbert haupt , meanwhile , took responsibility for the fpö 's poor showing , while emphasizing that he hopes to remain in his position .
he also spoke out in favor of another övp-fpö coalition .
before the election the de facto party leader jörg haider had rejected the idea of his party entering into another government with the people 's party . european reactions the european press has largely welcomed the freedom party 's fall . the german daily süddeutsche zeitung comments that : " the fpö is one of the first unrestrictedly populist parties in europe that has been in the awkward position of having to realize its promises .
the result is its total lack of credibility . "
according to italy 's la repubblica , the election shows that " the wave of euro-populist xenophobia is on its way out of europe . " the dutch daily volkskrant looks at the balance for chancellor schüssel : " political observers believe that he consciously pursued a strategy to bring the freedom patty down a notch by giving it governmental responsibilities .
the election shows that he succeeded .
now schüssel can hold his head high when he meets his colleagues in europe or show them the finger . " at the same time , the spanish daily el pais writes that schüssel faces two unappetizing choices : another coalition with the freedom party , could end up with the fpö breaking up , leaving schüssel to face a stronger opposition without a majority .
a coalition with the social democrats , however , could cause the same situation that brought the far-right into the government in the first place .
more of the conservative status quo schüssel 's new government is likely to continue its aims to limit deficit spending , pursue liberalization and privatize state stakes in austrian companies .
the övp is also a strong supporter of eu enlargement . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria votes on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .

when he rushed to yassir arafat 's headquarters in ramallah to show support for the besieged palestinian leader this spring after a meeting of globalization critics in porto allegre , brazil , critics said he had lost his footing . now the french daily " figaro " writes that bové has made his second mistake : instead of becoming a martyr for his cause , appealing for a pardon has turned him into a clown . bové , however , says he will take his case to the european court for human rights .

in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals . we love animals , but we also kill them .
we cuddle them , but we also hunt them .
we revere them , but we also use them .
we mass produce livestock , we keep house pets , we go on luxury safaris and , at the same time , we protect endangered species .
the list of incredible contradictions in the relationship between humans and the animal kingdom seems endless and is now the focus of a new exhibit at the german hygiene museum in dresden titled , " man and animals : scenes from a paradoxical relationship " .
the exhibit begins in a dimly-lit room .
loud speakers pipe out the sounds of many different types of animals .
hundreds of rubber animals are held in a case behind small adam and eve figures .
it 's clear from the beginning that the show 's creators have also infused a dose of humor into a provocative and deep subject .
tough moral questions " the exhibit is really about the self-image of humans , " says curator jasdan joerges .
" what 's so distinguishing about humans ?
what makes them human ?
who wears the crown of creation ?
will animals in the future need a bigger divide from humans ?
do we need new ethics for an animal of the future ?
these are the kinds of questions this exhibit deals with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals are a central component of human culture and civilization .
without them , we humans never would have become what we are today .
the first thematic block of the exhibit , under the title " beloved animals , " examines that motif .
the wide-reaching exhibit covers everything from hunting as an existential necessity to killing for sport , to the exotic menageries kept by european dynasties to today 's zoos , which have become the last refuges for some endangered species .
from the everyday to the bizarre the hygiene museum also devotes considerable space to examining the complex relationship between humans and their pets .
" the rank of house pets as a social and economic factor is enormous , " says joerges .
" it 's a billion euro industry .
we show everything here from jars from germany 's first blood bank for dogs to animal coffins to wedding dresses for dogs to fish-flavored toothpaste for cats to a model used to teach mouth-to-snout cpr . "
the show brings together more than 750 artifacts including paintings , films , stuffed animals and everyday objects .
it also includes its share of strange stuff , like a real elephant foot that was made into a trash can and given to former east german president wilhelm pieck on the occasion of his 80th birthday .
all of the exhibits are displayed behind a wire-netting fence , which is meant to symbolize the border between humans and animals .

the fire broke out early on sunday in the engine room of the panamanian-registered gaz poem , about 38 kilometres -lrb- 24 miles -rrb- east of hong kong .
the vessel was carrying 20,000 tons of liquefied petroleum gas , but officials said there was little chance of an explosion .
the tanker 's 34-strong crew abandoned ship on sunday after failing to bring the fire under control .
there were no reports of injuries .
beaten back a chinese official told reuters news agency that firefighters could not get close to the stricken vessel because the fire was so intense .
hong kong television stations showed pictures of smoke billowing from the ship but no flames were visible .
chinese and hong kong firefighters have been trying to extinguish the blaze , while the hong kong government sent two aircraft to the area to help with the operation , the associated press news agency reported .
captain ravi dewan of the hong kong maritime rescue center said strong winds were keeping the flames away from the cargo area , lessening the risk of an explosion .
crew rescued the gaz-poem was en route from hong kong to the southern chinese port city of yan tian when it caught fire .
it is not known what started the blaze .
the crew , reportedly of spanish and philippine origin , put to sea in lifeboats and were picked up by passing vessels , news agencies said .
the tanker 's exact current location has not been reported but it is believed to be well away from the chinese coast .
the blaze came less than a week after another tanker , carrying 77,000 metric tons of fuel oil , broke up and sank off the coast of spain .

switzerland 's rejection of stricter asylum laws also provokes much debate .
a czech paper views the government 's main tasks following the nato summit .
and in france ellen macarthur 's win in the route du rhum single-handed transatlantic yacht race is hailed .
far-right falls austria 's die presse views the conservative people 's party convincing win in the general elections as " first and foremost the victory of -lsb- party leader -rsb- chancellor wolfgang schuessel " .
voters have mercilessly punished the freedom party kurier " he has long worked himself up to becoming the most credible politician in the country , " it says .
but it is the crushing defeat experienced by joerg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpo -rrb- in the polls which attracts most comment .
" the fpo was basically voted out of office , " says the independent der standard , adding it " has been thrown back more or less to its 1986 position " .
" terrible and probably final " is how the centre-right tabloid kurier describes the fpo 's demise .
" the voters have mercilessly punished the freedom party , " it says , " for the fact and the manner in which it gambled away its chance to be a serious party of government . "
neighbours cheer in germany the berliner zeitung hails the election result .
according to the paper , the result " has shown that there are far too many votes for the extremist populism of joerg haider , but by far not enough to make him a danger to austria or even to europe " .
the eu 's policy of political sanctions against austria when the fpo first entered government is the reason for the fpo 's defeat , the sueddeutsche zeitung believes .
" pressure from outside forced vienna to keep haider , the leading light of the austrian right , away from national power , " it says .
in the czech republic , lidove noviny also views the impact of the austrian result on european affairs .
" the czech-eu integration effort will now not be stopped by vienna , " it says .
close vote action by another people 's party , this time in switzerland , makes the front page of all the country 's dailies .
the proposal by the right-wing swiss people 's party 's to drastically tighten asylum laws " has been rejected by a whisker " , writes the tribune de geneve - as only 50.1 % voted against the plan in sunday 's referendum .
on sunday evening switzerland appears deeply divided le temps the paper stresses that the results are only provisional and that " over the next few weeks a surprise can not be ruled out " .
it cites justice minister ruth metzler , as saying she wants to " respond to the fears " of those who voted " yes " in the referendum .
a cartoon in the french-language le temps shows ms metzler standing at a border crossing clutching " a new asylum law " .
" you are lucky it is me and not the people 's party , " she tells two asylum seekers , as a border guard holds open the barrier leading into the country .
' deeply divided ' a commentary in the same paper focuses on the slim margin between the two camps .
switzerland has saved itself from shameful damage to its liberal and humanitarian principles neue zurcher zeitung " on sunday evening switzerland appears deeply divided , " it says .
but no matter how close-run the referendum was , the german-language neue zurcher zeitung is sure of one thing : " switzerland has saved itself from a mess over its asylum policies as well as shameful damage to its liberal and humanitarian principles . "
nato newcomers as the czech republic is invited to join nato , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes looks at the challenges facing the country .
the nato summit is also good for hungary magyar hirlap " the czech republic did well as the host of the 21-22 november summit , " writes the paper , adding " now , however , prague must strive to score further points on the international political scene " .
the paper lists gaining support for eu accession , lowering the state budget deficit and job creation as the government 's main tasks .
" it is evident that the country can not be moving from one internal political turbulence to another , " the paper warns .
the hungarian magyar hirlap believes that the decisions taken at the prague summit are " good for hungary " as well .
the admission of new members - including three of hungary 's neighbours - to what it calls this " club of stability and democratic control " can only strengthen democracy in countries the suitability of which has been questioned by some , it says .
sailing to victory in france , the victory of british yachtswoman ellen macarthur in the monohull class of the transatlantic route du rhum race is celebrated in an editorial in le monde .
" this woman who is always seeking perfection , has realized a little feat by winning in a monohull before the multihulls for the first time since the contest was first held in 1978 , " it writes .
the paper concludes that ellen 's " choice of a boat more appropriate for the contest smiled on her " .

switzerland 's rejection of stricter asylum laws also provokes much debate .
a czech paper views the government 's main tasks following the nato summit .
and in france ellen macarthur 's win in the route du rhum single-handed transatlantic yacht race is hailed .
far-right falls austria 's die presse views the conservative people 's party convincing win in the general elections as " first and foremost the victory of -lsb- party leader -rsb- chancellor wolfgang schuessel " . "
voters have mercilessly punished the freedom party " kurier " he has long worked himself up to becoming the most credible politician in the country , " it says .
but it is the crushing defeat experienced by joerg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpo -rrb- in the polls which attracts most comment .
" the fpo was basically voted out of office , " says the independent der standard , adding it " has been thrown back more or less to its 1986 position " .
" terrible and probably final " is how the centre-right tabloid kurier describes the fpo 's demise .
" the voters have mercilessly punished the freedom party , " it says , " for the fact and the manner in which it gambled away its chance to be a serious party of government . "
neighbours cheer in germany the berliner zeitung hails the election result .
according to the paper , the result " has shown that there are far too many votes for the extremist populism of joerg haider , but by far not enough to make him a danger to austria or even to europe " .
the eu 's policy of political sanctions against austria when the fpo first entered government is the reason for the fpo 's defeat , the sueddeutsche zeitung believes .
" pressure from outside forced vienna to keep haider , the leading light of the austrian right , away from national power , " it says .
in the czech republic , lidove noviny also views the impact of the austrian result on european affairs .
" the czech-eu integration effort will now not be stopped by vienna , " it says .
close vote action by another people 's party , this time in switzerland , makes the front page of all the country 's dailies .
the proposal by the right-wing swiss people 's party 's to drastically tighten asylum laws " has been rejected by a whisker " , writes the tribune de geneve - as only 50.1 % voted against the plan in sunday 's referendum . "
on sunday evening switzerland appears deeply divided " le temps the paper stresses that the results are only provisional and that " over the next few weeks a surprise can not be ruled out " .
it cites justice minister ruth metzler , as saying she wants to " respond to the fears " of those who voted " yes " in the referendum .
a cartoon in the french-language le temps shows ms metzler standing at a border crossing clutching " a new asylum law " .
" you are lucky it is me and not the people 's party , " she tells two asylum seekers , as a border guard holds open the barrier leading into the country .
' deeply divided ' a commentary in the same paper focuses on the slim margin between the two camps . "
switzerland has saved itself from shameful damage to its liberal and humanitarian principles " neue zurcher zeitung " on sunday evening switzerland appears deeply divided , " it says .
but no matter how close-run the referendum was , the german-language neue zurcher zeitung is sure of one thing : " switzerland has saved itself from a mess over its asylum policies as well as shameful damage to its liberal and humanitarian principles . "
nato newcomers as the czech republic is invited to join nato , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes looks at the challenges facing the country . "
the nato summit is also good for hungary " magyar hirlap " the czech republic did well as the host of the 21-22 november summit , " writes the paper , adding " now , however , prague must strive to score further points on the international political scene " .
the paper lists gaining support for eu accession , lowering the state budget deficit and job creation as the government 's main tasks .
" it is evident that the country can not be moving from one internal political turbulence to another , " the paper warns .
the hungarian magyar hirlap believes that the decisions taken at the prague summit are " good for hungary " as well .
the admission of new members - including three of hungary 's neighbours - to what it calls this " club of stability and democratic control " can only strengthen democracy in countries the suitability of which has been questioned by some , it says .
sailing to victory in france , the victory of british yachtswoman ellen macarthur in the monohull class of the transatlantic route du rhum race is celebrated in an editorial in le monde .
" this woman who is always seeking perfection , has realized a little feat by winning in a monohull before the multihulls for the first time since the contest was first held in 1978 , " it writes .
the paper concludes that ellen 's " choice of a boat more appropriate for the contest smiled on her " .

political parties have been organising primaries and drafting candidates for their lists in record time .
one logistical headache for some , however , is how to vote from space .
israel 's science ministry has said it is investigating ways to allow colonel ilan ramon , the country 's first astronaut , to cast his ballot aboard the space shuttle columbia , scheduled to lift off on 16 january 2003 .
israel 's first space traveller faces other difficulties : how does a jew observe the sabbath in space ?
while in space colonel ramon intends to observe the sabbath more precisely , if he or she is in a low-lying orbit where the sun rises and sets every 90 minutes , what constitutes the biblical " seventh day of rest ? "
colonel ramon is not particularly religious on the ground , but believes it is important to mark the sabbath in space .
" my mother is a holocaust survivor who was in auschwitz and my father fought for the independence of israel not so long ago , " says the 48-year-old veteran fighter pilot from the israel air force .
" i was born in israel and i 'm kind of the proof for my parents and their generation that whatever we 've been fighting for in the last century is becoming true .
" i feel i 'm representing the whole jewish people , " adds colonel ramon , who will be columbia 's payload specialist on its 16-day mission designed to study how the human body adapts to the zero gravity of space .
so how will colonel ramon celebrate the sabbath ?
" basically , we 've decided that he 'll follow cape canaveral time , " says rabbi zvi konikov , a florida-based orthodox rabbi to whom colonel ramon posed the question .
kosher meals rabbi konikov 's ruling is based on a principle in jewish law that if one lives in a remote place , he or she should celebrate the sabbath according to the times of the nearest big city with a sizeable jewish community .
i was surprised and overwhelmed by the effort nasa made to accommodate my request colonel ilan ramon , astronaut for example , jews in alaska celebrate the day according to seattle time .
the most notable features of the jewish sabbath include the lighting of candles and the recitation of a blessing over wine - called kiddush - which inaugurate the day of rest .
strictly religious jews also refrain from all forms of creative labour , such as using electricity and writing .
since most prohibitions are not practical aboard a manned spacecraft - especially lighting a fire which could be downright dangerous - colonel ramon has chosen the kiddush blessing as his way of celebrating the sabbath .
" i was surprised and overwhelmed by the effort nasa made to accommodate my request , " says colonel ramon , who has also managed to get kosher meals provided during the mission .
" i 'm impressed by colonel ramon , " says rabbi zonikov , who will be attending the launch as a guest of the astronaut .
" here is a successful , colourful scientist and air force pilot and what 's on his mind - the sabbath !
that 's incredible .
in addition to fulfilling his mission for nasa , it 's clear ilan also wants to represent israel and the jewish people with pride . "
remembering the holocaust among the nine personal items nasa will let colonel ramon take with him into space will be a small pencil drawing made over 60 years ago by a 14-year-old boy who was killed in auschwitz .
ramon will take a 60-year-old picture drawn by a boy killed in auschwitz petr ginz 's " moon landscape " is an emotional work created by the czech boy during his imprisonment in the theresienstadt ghetto .
it portrays the earth from a safe distance - revealing the young man 's dream to escape his earthly ghetto walls .
yad vashem , israel 's national holocaust museum , chose the painting at the request of colonel ramon , who asked for a holocaust-related item to be taken with him .
while his mother survived the nazi horrors , ramon 's grandfather and many extended relatives perished in the death camps .
an official at yad vashem says : " ' moon landscape ' connects the dream of one jewish boy who is a symbol of the talent lost in the holocaust to the journey of a jewish astronaut , who is a symbol of our national revival . "

two homes were destroyed in the blaze .
no-one was injured .
the firefighters left their picket line to attend the fire on the newry road , but pulled back once it became clear there was no risk to life .
charles johnson , whose son 's house was burned said he was disgusted by the attitude of the striking firefighters .
" once they had established there was no life at risk and all the houses had been evacuated , they said it was no longer their responsibility , that they could n't do anything about putting the fire out .
" one of them actually said to me that the whole terrace was going to go and that we were going to lose the six houses .
we were absolutely disgusted , " he said .
the fire was dealt with by two yellow goddesses and a team of retained firefighters .
meanwhile , in belfast 's donegall avenue a man and a woman were taken to hospital with smoke inhalation after a fire in their home .
it started at about 0430 gmt on monday and it is believed to have been caused by an electrical fault .
in londonderry , the alarm was raised at about midnight at the tilly and henderson building .
it is the eighth time the goddesses have been called out to the derelict building since the strike began on friday .
more than a dozen firefighters used specialist cutting equipment to release four people , including two children , who were trapped after a head-on car crash near dungiven , in county londonderry .
all were taken to hospital after the accident on saturday night where their condition was described as stable .
fire brigades ' union spokesman kieran barr said the decision to attend the accident was necessary .
" they would have waited a long time for the arrival of the army , " he said .
" we believe and know that the army is not that well equipped to carry out such rescues . "
meanwhile , in east belfast , a yellow goddess was called out to a fire in a derelict building on the newtownards road .
no-one was injured .
military firefighters have been sent to 71 incidents in northern ireland since the start of the strike on friday .
' deal unaffordable ' as the strike continues into the third of its scheduled eight days on sunday , there is still no sign of a breakthrough on the issue of pay .
chancellor gordon brown has said that a 16 % pay rise for firefighters - without savings from new working practices - would be unaffordable .
he said the inflation-busting deal , discussed in pay talks early on friday , would cost britain more than £ 500m over the next three years .
tuc general secretary john monks called for a return to " calm reasoning " and an end to recriminations in the dispute .
deputy prime minister john prescott adopted a conciliatory tone , calling for " more talking and less walking " .
" the fbu and employers were close to a solution on thursday .
that deal is still worth talking about , " he said .
meanwhile , a firefighter is recovering in hospital after he suffered serious burns in an accident at a picket line in county down .
he was lighting a brazier outside banbridge fire station on saturday when he was burned on his face , hands and legs .
the firefighter was taken to hospital in newry before being transferred to a specialist burns unit in belfast .
his injuries are not life threatening .
jim barbour of the fire brigades ' union said the incident highlighted the fact that everyone , including firefighters , had to be careful .
" it can happen to the best of us , " he said " everyone needs to be as vigilant as possible . "
