plenty are biting . more than 80 parties have expressed interest in insolvent film rights trader and broadcaster kirchmedia .
but few have made progress in putting together bidding consortia for the core unit of media mogul leo kirch ’ s empire .
a munich court has placed the company under its formal jurisdiction , officially opening the door for its liquidation .
leading the list of interested parties is a consortium including germany 's commerzbank , essen-based publisher waz mediengruppe , and sony corp 's columbia tristar .
but this media thriller took a new turn on monday evening , when the waz management announced it was pulling out of the deal .
commerzbank has said , however , that it is open to other partners in the bidding consortia .
a golden opportunity the waz move opens up new possibilities for one of germany 's most influential publishers , the axel springer verlag .
the hamburg-based group is busy putting together a competing consortia , together with fellow publishing house heinrich bauer verlag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's top-selling tabloid , bild .
this could give springer , publisher of germany 's top-selling tabloid bild , a chance to get its foot in the door of the television sector .
either way , the creditor banks are rubbing their hands together in glee .
they hope the added competition from springer will bump up the reported two billion euro the commerzbank consortium is said to be offering for kirchmedia .
an ironic twist if springer were to increase its stake in kirchmedia , it would be an ironic twist of fate .
leo kirch held 40 percent of springer verlag until his empire crumbled .
for years , he unsuccessfully tried to gain majority control of the publisher , who adamantly opposed such a move .
at the end of january , springer invoked a clause to force the 767 million euro -lrb- $ 726 million -rrb- sale of its 11.5 percent stake in pro sieben sat.1 media , which is part of kirchmedia .
the move prompted kirch 's collapse .
industry observers believe the springer consortium is seeking to acquire a stake greater than 25 percent in kirchmedia in order to have veto power over the company 's strategic decisions .
however , many analysts are skeptical that it will be successful .
they say springer and bauer can not find an adequate financial investor for such a deal .
kirchmedia will hold a meeting of its creditors on august 1 , where it ’ s expected to unveil bids from consortia of german and international investors . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kirch media set to be pared down to the core kirchmedia administrators want to see a dramatically streamlined holding group emerging from the insolvency process .
it should essentially be pared down to its original core business of film rights trading , plus its majority stake in listed television group pro sieben sat 1 media ag .

memories of austria ’ s worst peacetime disaster are awakened as prosecutors begin trying 16 people for the ski train inferno in caprun in 2000 that killed 155 people . an austrian court has begun hearing charges against sixteen ski resort workers and inspectors charged with responsibility for a fire in a ski train that killed 155 people in november 2000 .
the dead , who were mainly skiers setting out for a day on the slopes of the popular alpine resort of kaprun , included people from germany , america , austria and japan .
a defective electric heater is said to have triggered the fire which quickly spread through the two-car funicular train bringing it to a stop in a steep , dark 3.2 kilometre tunnel leading to the kitzsteinhorn glacier .
scores of people were unable to escape the train when the doors failed to open .
many bodies were charred beyond recognition in the intense blaze .
only 12 people survived .
prosecutors said at the trial that negligence was the root cause of the disaster .
they spoke of a " mosaic of errors " , including the installation of a non-regulation electric heater , the lack of fire extinguishers or emergency hammers for smashing windows to escape .

germany and france look set for a run-in at this weekend 's e.u. summit in seville , particularly over the question of the budget goals laid down in the pact for stability and growth . the german government under chancellor gerhard schröder looks set for a run-in with france , possibly the country 's most important european union partner , at this weekend 's e.u. summit in seville .
there are three key issues at stake .
first is the question of direct aid to farmers from the central and eastern european countries that are about to accede to the e.u. on sunday , schröder made it clear that he will not go along with the plan to allow the accession countries to start receiving aid from 2004 onwards .
he said before any such aid is paid out , there must be a full reform of eu agricultural policy .
france , meanwhile , believes that such a reform need not take place until 2006 .
its new agricultural minister , hervé gaymard , warned on monday of the possibility of a complete destruction of the common agricultural policy .
meanwhile , it 's clear from statements made by insiders on monday that the german government is set to take a hard line on two other issues : the goals laid down in the eu 's pact for stability and growth , and france 's decision in 2000 – along with italy and the netherlands – to introduce tax subsidies on diesel oil in response to road-blockade protests from truck drivers and haulers .
here , as with agricultural policy , the german and french stances seem to vary wildly .
and it 's the issue of the stability pact that 's seen to offer the greatest potential for conflict . " ; germany will reject any attempt to put back the target date for a balanced budget from the agreed 2004 to 2006 , " ; said one german government insider .
this effectively represents a rejection of an idea mooted on several occasions by president jacques chirac of france .
german government insiders were on monday also pointing out that the last figures showed france 's budget deficit standing at 2.6 % of the country 's gross domestic product .
this , it was argued , is dangerously close to the 3 % upper limit allowed under the stability pact .
earlier this year , germany narrowly avoided the issue of an e.u. commission warning letter over its budget deficits .
that debate produced a reaffirmation of germany 's commitment to the targets set out in the stability pact , particularly the goal of a balanced budget by 2004 .
german government insiders were on monday wondering aloud why it was that the commission is taking a more relaxed view of the budget difficulties currently experienced by france – and also by italy and portugal – than it did of germany 's .
the eu commission rejected any talk of preferential treatment .
" we treat all member-states the same , " said a spokesman for monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
the commission would not be able to work out whether member-states were likely to reach their budget targets before the start of 2003 .
only then would it be possible to evaluate the budget situation in the member-states , solbes ' spokesman added .
the spokesman said that the commission had no knowledge of an increased french deficit .
right now , no decisions had been taken on the possibility of any new warning letters , he said .
member-states were working towards the goal of achieving a virtually balanced budget by 2004 .

only then would it be possible to evaluate the budget situation in the member-states , solbes ' spokesman added .
the spokesman said that the commission had no knowledge of an increased french deficit .
right now , no decisions had been taken on the possibility of any new warning letters , he said .
member-states were working towards the goal of achieving a virtually balanced budget by 2004 .
that goal was set out in the eu 's economic-policy guidelines for 2002 .

this defendant can receive a fair trial here as well as elsewhere judge t s ellis judge t s ellis ' decision clears the way for the government to proceed with its case against john walker lindh on charges that he conspired to kill americans .
mr lindh 's lawyers had argued that he could not get a fair trial at a courthouse just over 14 kilometres -lrb- 9 miles -rrb- from the site of the 11 september attack on the pentagon .
they also defended mr lindh 's right to associate with the taleban and suggested he had joined the afghan militia to serve as a soldier .
federal prosecutors countered that the defendant had been involved with " violent groups " and argued that a jury sitting in the court in alexandria , virginia , would be as objective as any other in the united states .
the judge appeared to agree , ruling that : " this defendant can receive a fair trial here as well as elsewhere . " ' 20th hijacker ' requests some of the same concerns have also been raised by zacarias moussaoui , the only person to be facing charges directly connected to the 11 september attacks .
zacarias moussaoui has handwritten requests for his case to be dismissed mr moussaoui , whom prosecutors say would have been the " 20th hijacker " on board planes crashed deliberately in new york and washington if he had not been arrested , has filed several motions asking for all charges to be dropped or his trial to be moved .
the papers were released by us district judge leonie brinkema in alexandria , virginia , who has been handling his case .
she released a total of 15 motions - some of them handwritten in english - as well as appointing a new lawyer for mr moussaoui who has said he wants to represent himself .
' bent on violence ' in his case , george harris , a lawyer for mr lindh , declared : " you ca n't charge a soldier with murder for simply being a soldier . "
' american taleban ' born into middle-class , christian family , converted to islam at 16 captured by us forces in afghanistan while fighting for the taleban against afghan rivals faces 10 charges including conspiring to kill americans and providing support to terrorists the lawyer accused the us government of building a case against mr lindh - arrested in afghanistan last year - of " guilt by association rather than individual culpability " .
his client , he argued , had joined the taleban to help fight rival afghan forces and not to help al-qaeda attack the us .
another lawyer , james brosnahan , said the government had deliberately chosen to try mr lindh near the pentagon .
" that is not the environment where john lindh can get a fair trial , " he said .
a jury is due to be selected in late august , meaning that the trial will be under way when the first anniversary of the 11 september attacks occurs .
the defence has been pressing for the trial to be switched to california , where mr lindh grew up .
assistant us attorney john davis insisted mr lindh 's case was " not about association , but about acts of violence with groups bent on violence " .

the home office says the debate has been postponed because of " timetabling difficulties " , but privately officials say new safeguards are being added in reaction to criticism . "
no acceptable case has been made for this " snooper 's charter " " lord strathclyde a committee of mps had been due to vote on the controversial proposals on tuesday , but the government has put the debate back .
the move comes as conservative peers threatened to use their voting strength to block the plans in the house of lords .
critics claim the plan - which would allow local councils and other organisations to check private telephone records - amounts to a " snooper 's charter " .
that claim was denied by home office minister bob ainsworth as he argued misunderstandings had to be dispelled .
new safeguards officials in many of the agencies that could get the powers could already ask for the same information on a voluntary basis , he said .
" it is in no way a snooper 's charter , " mr ainsworth told bbc radio 4 's world at one programme .
he said the measures were intended to " provide safeguards and guidance as to when people can get information and when they ca n't " .
parliament will only have the briefest of opportunities to debate the plans because they only extend laws passed two years ago .
it is possible the debate will now happen either on monday 24 june or a week later .
the conservative leader in the lords , tom strathclyde , said if mps failed in their duty to protect people 's rights and freedoms , the house of lords would .
lord strathclyde told the world at one : " it is very important that there is that parliamentary hurdle . "
if officials in councils and other agencies believed a crime was being committed , they should ask the police to investigate , he argued .
lib dem lords leader tom mcnally echoed those concerns .
he said the plans would not get through the house of lords in their current form .
' intrusive powers ' in a letter to the daily telegraph , john wadham , director of civil rights campaigners liberty , questioned the government 's justification for the changes to the regulation of investigatory powers act -lrb- ripa -rrb- .
he questioned whether it was necessary to extend electronic surveillance powers to organisations such as district councils , the post office or the food standards agency .
" of course the vast majority of officials will seek to use these powers honestly and proportionately .
" but if you give such intrusive powers to so many people with so broad and vague a list of justifications , the evidence from history is that these powers will be abused . "
room for debate under the plan , seven government departments and a wide range of organisations will be able to look at private e-mail and telephone records .
at the moment , the powers only apply to the police , inland revenue and customs and excise . "
it is not a fait accompli " home office spokesman the home office refused to confirm a story in the sunday times that home secretary david blunkett was planning two modifications to the legislation .
the newspaper said mr blunkett wanted to ensure that only chief executives of local councils , regulatory bodies and government agencies would be allowed to apply for access to confidential telephone records .
pirate radio this would prevent minor officials and civil servants from gaining access to private information .
also , according to the the sunday times , organisations would only be given access to information that was directly relevant to their jurisdiction .
the government has cited the investigation of benefit fraud rings and pirate radio stations as two examples where the new powers would be used .
the food standards agency , which investigates unhygienic slaughterhouses , would also use the new powers .

while some mistakes and accidents have trivial consequences , others end in the death of patients .
dr phil hammond , the presenter of the bbc series " trust me , i 'm a doctor , " mistakenly administered the very drug health experts are on the verge of issuing a warning about .
his mistake as a junior came a few millimetres from killing a patient .
dr hammond was in his final year as a junior doctor , when , at 3am , he made the error .
it involved two indentical looking liquids , contained in almost identical bottles .
one was saline solution , the other potassium chloride .
saline is an everyday tool in the health service , used to dilute far more powerful medications like potassium chloride .
i was tired , and i was too naive and not brave enough to ask for help dr phil hammond he told the bbc : " i was working a locum shift , which i had never really been trained to do .
" i was called to see a woman at 3am , and was asked to give her a small amount of potassium in a drip .
" i was tired , and i was too naive and not brave enough to ask for help . "
instead of a bottle of saline , he picked up the almost identical bottle of potassium , and hooked it up to her drip .
fatal dose at that dose , the drug would have stopped the patient 's heart within moments .
drug danger : confusion can cause mistakes " if the drip had been in properly , i would have killed her .
" fortunately i was so incompetent that i had n't even done that properly . "
instead , the small amount of potassium which reached the small area around the needle caused intense pain to the patient .
" i realised straight away , but i did n't admit what had happened , i made some fatuous comment that she must be allergic to saline .
" it was a very near miss . "
you just burn the notes , bury the x-rays and push it under the carpet dr phil hammond regulations brought in by the government last year now demand that all " near misses " - especially a close call like this - should be reported to management , and ultimately to the national patient safety agency so that lessons could be learned .
no-one told that was n't the case then .
" i did n't report it .
there was n't any error reporting system . "
he said that the climate of the times meant that doctors were too ashamed to own up to any error , and he told only a few friends .
it 's exactly the same as pushing the wrong number into a cash machine , putting a video back in the wrong box .
dr phil hammond " you just burn the notes , bury the x-rays and push it under the carpet . "
and his mistake was no isolated incident .
" most doctors in training can remember situations where they either directly led to the demise of a patient or a very near miss , often through drug maladministration , with lots of drugs with very similar names , lots of similar bottles . "
" when you analyse it , it 's exactly the same as pushing the wrong number into a cash machine , putting a video back in the wrong box .
they are ordinary , everyday errors . "
he fully supports a move to a " no-blame " culture , which recognises that " good people can make bad mistakes " , as this will help bring in changes to keep patients safer .
" we should n't have to wait for a hundred deaths to change the colour of a bottle . "

that is average pay of more than $ 5m for each executive .
kenneth lay , the firm 's former chairman , is estimated to have received more than $ 150m , including his salary , bonus and stock options .
the news has infuriated former workers and shareholders who accuse the managers of raiding enron 's coffers at their expense .
the bonuses stand in stark contrast to the severance pay of up to $ 13,500 received by less senior enron employees .
improper retention ?
enron filed for bankruptcy in december after admitting it had vastly overstated its accounts for the previous five years .
it is one of the biggest corporate scandals to shake the us , and has had widespread ramifications for other firms who are rushing to clean up their accountancy practices .
in addition to the executive pay and awards , enron paid $ 50m to retain 76 employees it deemed critical to its operations .
the retention bonuses came just three months before enron 's collapse , and were described as " a staple in bankruptcy planning " by the cash-short firm .
but some legal experts have said they were improperly paid and represented an unusually large amount of money .
insider trading accusations enron 's bankruptcy has spawned dozens of investigations and a slew of lawsuits from angry investors who saw their savings become worthless .
enron 's auditor , andersen , has already been found guilty of obstructing justice by shredding evidence relating to enron 's accounts .
enron has not yet faced a criminal charge , but is expected to do so .
one potential issue is insider trading , as senior executives have been accused of selling their share options while having access to exclusive information regarding enron 's predicament .
among the other executives who shared in the pay were former chief executive jeffrey skilling and former chief financial officer andrew fastow .
spokesmen from mr skilling , mr fastow and mr lay have not commented on the pay revelations .
the figures were disclosed in a 1,436-page filing with the federal bankruptcy court in new york .

alastair campbell is quoted in a think-tank 's new report , which says much of the £ 2bn losses experiences by the british tourist industry during the crisis was due to a lack of communication with the public overseas . "
governments do not pay enough attention to the way that stories will be received abroad " mark leonard foreign policy centre the foreign policy centre , which has close links to downing street , says the uk must realise that influencing public opinion abroad is as important as talking to diplomats .
author mark leonard says that increasingly , ordinary people can play a key role - from persuading people not to become terrorists to encouraging reform of farming policies .
yellow suit mr leonard cites the foot-and-mouth crisis as an example of how government departments fail to take account of how news stories will be seen overseas .
downing street communications director mr campbell , interviewed for the report , said foot-and-mouth saw a " collision " between domestic and foreign audiences .
he recalled when tony blair had worn a yellow protective suit when visiting one farm during the outbreak .
" part of our message , once we 'd focused on it as a crisis management issue being led from the top , was the prime minister was involved , sleeves rolled up , talking to farmers regularly ...
" i admit that this did n't cross my mind , you get these dramatic pictures of the prime minister wearing yellow suits and walking around a farmyard and in america they think : ' christ !
he 's got to wear a yellow suit !
and he 's the prime minister ! '
" mr leonard argues that more information needs to be given to foreign correspondents based in london , who play a key part in forming opinion abroad .
communication problems staff in uk embassies overseas also had difficulty in getting information about foot-and-mouth , says the report .
one official said : " the lines maff -lrb- the then ministry of agriculture -rrb- produced may have been fine in the uk but they failed to address concerns overseas .
" the ' formal ' end of foot-and-mouth was announced at midnight with no notice to embassies . "
mr leonard says the government needs to move away from the traditional focus on british diplomats talking to governments abroad .
as well as forging better links with the foreign media , non-governmental organisations and other non-political figures can better convey the uk 's message , he says .
the foreign office should appoint " plausible spokesmen " to major media organisations like cnn and al-jazeera .
less competition he suggests chef raymond blanc made a far better case in france on the safety of british beef than british diplomats .
as part of his appeal for a new type of diplomacy , mr leonard also says western powers are competing unnecessarily in more than 200 countries .
instead , the uk should focus on 50 nations where it has a direct interest and should co-operate with other countries in other regions .
colonial " hangovers " where countries , including the uk , focus on the nations with which they have the greatest historical links , are absurd , mr leonard continues .
new tone he urges mr blair to use the european union summit in denmark this autumn to suggest the eu develop plans for co-operation on " public diplomacy " .
a new tone is also needed , he says , so diplomacy is more about winning arguments and less about propaganda .
he acknowledges the successes the british council has achieved but says more is needed .
with surveys showing young people abroad especially see the uk as a country in decline , more work needs to be done on proving british relevance .

alastair campbell is quoted in a think-tank 's new report , which says much of the £ 2bn losses experiences by the british tourist industry during the crisis was due to a lack of communication with the public overseas .
governments do not pay enough attention to the way that stories will be received abroad mark leonard foreign policy centre the foreign policy centre , which has close links to downing street , says the uk must realise that influencing public opinion abroad is as important as talking to diplomats .
author mark leonard says that increasingly , ordinary people can play a key role - from persuading people not to become terrorists to encouraging reform of farming policies .

the c & g said it was writing to some of its borrowers after deciding not to challenge a ruling from the financial ombudsman over its dual mortgage rate .
last week the ombudsman ordered the c & g to reimburse a customer who had not been allowed to switch to a cheaper mortgage rate that was on offer to other customers .
the company had introduced the c & g variable rate last year to reward existing customers by offering them an interest rate that was lower than the standard variable rate .
limited scope c & g , which is part of lloyds tsb , would not say exactly how many people were involved or how much would be paid in compensation .
mortgage experts said as many as 500,000 customers could have been affected by the company 's dual mortgage rate policy .
but only a fraction were likely to be eligible for compensation because the scope of the ombudsman 's decision was limited .
abbey national is also awaiting a ruling over dual rates from the ombudsman .
this is expected within weeks .
token payments both nationwide and halifax lost similar cases but they have treated the issue of compensation very differently .
nationwide is now in the process of spending £ 90m backdating payments to more than 400,000 customers , who held products linked to a higher variable rate between march 2001 and april 2002 .
complaints procedure approach the company if dissatisfied with its response , go to the financial ombudsman -lrb- see internet link -rrb- halifax , however , has refused to compensate all customers and will only pay out to those who lodged complaints before 1 march 2002 .
it has so far paid out £ 8m to 30,000 customers who had capped-rate mortgages and lodged a complaint before 1 february 2002 .
it is offering a token £ 100 payment to customers who complained between 1 february 2002 and 1 march 2002 .
anyone who failed to lodge a complaint with the bank before then , and who is unhappy with the halifax 's refusal to offer universal compensation , must go to the financial ombudsman to seek redress .
