but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping . in the course of debate surrounding the international criminal court , the united states threatened to use its veto power in the un security council to block the continuation of the bosnia mandate beyond the july 3rd deadline .
earlier in the week , washington had warned the international body , that it would remove its personnel from the mission if its soldiers were not granted judicial immunity from newly established icc .
at the last moment , however , the 15 member security council managed to extend the deadline for the vote until july 15 .
in the meantime , the fate of the bosnia mission hangs in balance as international talks continue to focus on persuading the us to stick with the mission and others like it .
dispute over bosnia set up in 1995 , the un bosnia mission is an international police task force , for which more than 1,500 police officers and 1,700 civilians have been sent to the region .
their task is to maintain law enforcement , coordinate humanitarian relief , aid refugees , oversee elections and help rebuild the country ’ s destroyed infrastructure .
the united states is represented in bosnia by a mini-contingent of only 46 people .
and yet its threat to back out of the mandate has met with a disproportionately loud and resounding cry of concern from the international community .
european leaders have been especially outspoken in their criticism of the us .
they fear that the american veto of bosnia and its insistence on legal immunity for soldiers participating in the mission could be indicative of the way washington will respond to other un peacekeeping missions .
such a stance would threaten to " damage the authority of the united nations , " said germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer .
danish foreign minister per stig moller , whose country holds the eu ’ s rotating presidency , emphasized the need to find a " satisfactory solution that does not harm the integrity of the icc and which allows for the continuation of un peacekeeping operations and preserves the us engagement in them . "
un secretary general kofi annan warned the us against putting the entire peacekeeping system at risk over what he said were " exaggerated us fears of vulnerability to the new icc " .
the dispute over bosnia is likely to expand to other un peacekeeping missions .
in the upcoming days and weeks , the future of four more un peacekeeping missions will come up for voting in the security council : georgia , lebanon , west-sahara and the region of prevlaka , which is claimed by both croatia and montenegro .
in each case , the us is either directly involved with personnel or has contributed financially to the mission .
prevlaka in addition to the bosnia and kosovo missions in the balkans , the un also has a peacekeeping mandate for the prevlaka peninsula .
it was established in 1996 to monitor a cease-fire between croatia and montenegro , which have been fighting for possession of the region since the former yugoslavia began breaking up in the early 1990s .
there are 27 military observers stationed in prevlaka , but no americans .
the cost for the mission is $ 143 million .
on july 15 , the security council will vote on whether or not to extend the mission .
lebanon in 1978 , after israel ’ s military invasion and occupation of lebanon , the un security council called for the establishment of an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon .
the mission has been active in the region ever since .
the troops are responsible for verifying israel ’ s withdrawal from lebanon and monitoring the peaceful transition to lebanese self-government in the region .
given the current situation in the middle east , the mission is one of the more volatile ones , and the political situation is still uncertain .
since the mission began , there have been 245 fatalities .
approximately 3,600 uniformed troops , 50 military observers an 120 international civilians are involved in the mission .
no americans are participating .
the annual cost for maintaining the peacekeepers is $ 143 .
on july 31 , the security council will convene for a vote on the future of the mission .
georgia un peacekeepers have been stationed in the former soviet republic of georgia since 1993 .

108 military observers and 96 international civilians are involved in the mission .
the us has sent two observers .
the annual budget is 27.9 million .
on july 31 , the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension .
western sahara the united nations has been seeking a peaceful solution to the territorial conflict over western sahara since the withdrawal of spain in 1976 and the ensuing fighting between morocco , which had " reintegrated " the territory and the polisario front , which is supported by algeria .

there are 255 uniformed troops , 204 military observers and 173 international civilians stationed in the region .
10 un personnel have been killed since the mission began .
the annual cost is $ 50.5 million .
the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension on july 31 .
few troops , big monetary contributions compared to the other 86 countries involved in un peacekeeping missions , the us sends very few personnel .
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed worldwide , only 704 are american .
of these , 670 are civilian police , and the majority are stationed on the balkans .
in total , the us personnel contribution constitutes only three percent of the overall un peacekeeping contingent .
this is far less than countries such as bangladesh and pakistan , which contribute 5,479 and 4,831 peacekeepers respectively .
but when it comes to financial support , the us far outdoes the rest of the un members .
america pays for more than one third of the un ’ s peacekeeping expenses -lrb- $ 2.77 billion for 2001-2002 -rrb- .
for this reason , the international community is concerned about that the dispute over bosnia could expand to include other upcoming missions .

but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping . in the course of debate surrounding the international criminal court , the united states threatened to use its veto power in the un security council to block the continuation of the bosnia mandate beyond the july 3rd deadline .
earlier in the week , washington had warned the international body , that it would remove its personnel from the mission if its soldiers were not granted judicial immunity from newly established icc .
at the last moment , however , the 15 member security council managed to extend the deadline for the vote until july 15 .
in the meantime , the fate of the bosnia mission hangs in balance as international talks continue to focus on persuading the us to stick with the mission and others like it .
dispute over bosnia set up in 1995 , the un bosnia mission is an international police task force , for which more than 1,500 police officers and 1,700 civilians have been sent to the region .
their task is to maintain law enforcement , coordinate humanitarian relief , aid refugees , oversee elections and help rebuild the country ’ s destroyed infrastructure .
the united states is represented in bosnia by a mini-contingent of only 46 people .
and yet its threat to back out of the mandate has met with a disproportionately loud and resounding cry of concern from the international community .
european leaders have been especially outspoken in their criticism of the us .
they fear that the american veto of bosnia and its insistence on legal immunity for soldiers participating in the mission could be indicative of the way washington will respond to other un peacekeeping missions .
such a stance would threaten to " damage the authority of the united nations , " said germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer .
danish foreign minister per stig moller , whose country holds the eu ’ s rotating presidency , emphasized the need to find a " satisfactory solution that does not harm the integrity of the icc and which allows for the continuation of un peacekeeping operations and preserves the us engagement in them . "
un secretary general kofi annan warned the us against putting the entire peacekeeping system at risk over what he said were " exaggerated us fears of vulnerability to the new icc " .
the dispute over bosnia is likely to expand to other un peacekeeping missions .
in the upcoming days and weeks , the future of four more un peacekeeping missions will come up for voting in the security council : georgia , lebanon , west-sahara and the region of prevlaka , which is claimed by both croatia and montenegro .
in each case , the us is either directly involved with personnel or has contributed financially to the mission .
prevlaka in addition to the bosnia and kosovo missions in the balkans , the un also has a peacekeeping mandate for the prevlaka peninsula .
it was established in 1996 to monitor a cease-fire between croatia and montenegro , which have been fighting for possession of the region since the former yugoslavia began breaking up in the early 1990s .
there are 27 military observers stationed in prevlaka , but no americans .
the cost for the mission is $ 143 million .
on july 15 , the security council will vote on whether or not to extend the mission .
lebanon in 1978 , after israel ’ s military invasion and occupation of lebanon , the un security council called for the establishment of an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon .
the mission has been active in the region ever since .
the troops are responsible for verifying israel ’ s withdrawal from lebanon and monitoring the peaceful transition to lebanese self-government in the region .
given the current situation in the middle east , the mission is one of the more volatile ones , and the political situation is still uncertain .
since the mission began , there have been 245 fatalities .
approximately 3,600 uniformed troops , 50 military observers an 120 international civilians are involved in the mission .
no americans are participating .
the annual cost for maintaining the peacekeepers is $ 143 .
on july 31 , the security council will convene for a vote on the future of the mission .
georgia un peacekeepers have been stationed in the former soviet republic of georgia since 1993 .

108 military observers and 96 international civilians are involved in the mission .
the us has sent two observers .
the annual budget is 27.9 million .
on july 31 , the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension .
western sahara the united nations has been seeking a peaceful solution to the territorial conflict over western sahara since the withdrawal of spain in 1976 and the ensuing fighting between morocco , which had " reintegrated " the territory and the polisario front , which is supported by algeria .

there are 255 uniformed troops , 204 military observers and 173 international civilians stationed in the region .
10 un personnel have been killed since the mission began .
the annual cost is $ 50.5 million .
the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension on july 31 .
few troops , big monetary contributions compared to the other 86 countries involved in un peacekeeping missions , the us sends very few personnel .
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed worldwide , only 704 are american .
of these , 670 are civilian police , and the majority are stationed on the balkans .
in total , the us personnel contribution constitutes only three percent of the overall un peacekeeping contingent .
this is far less than countries such as bangladesh and pakistan , which contribute 5,479 and 4,831 peacekeepers respectively .
but when it comes to financial support , the us far outdoes the rest of the un members .
america pays for more than one third of the un ’ s peacekeeping expenses -lrb- $ 2.77 billion for 2001-2002 -rrb- .
for this reason , the international community is concerned about that the dispute over bosnia could expand to include other upcoming missions .

but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping . in the course of debate surrounding the international criminal court , the united states threatened to use its veto power in the un security council to block the continuation of the bosnia mandate beyond the july 3rd deadline .
earlier in the week , washington had warned the international body , that it would remove its personnel from the mission if its soldiers were not granted judicial immunity from newly established icc .
at the last moment , however , the 15 member security council managed to extend the deadline for the vote until july 15 .
in the meantime , the fate of the bosnia mission hangs in balance as international talks continue to focus on persuading the us to stick with the mission and others like it .
dispute over bosnia set up in 1995 , the un bosnia mission is an international police task force , for which more than 1,500 police officers and 1,700 civilians have been sent to the region .
their task is to maintain law enforcement , coordinate humanitarian relief , aid refugees , oversee elections and help rebuild the country ’ s destroyed infrastructure .
the united states is represented in bosnia by a mini-contingent of only 46 people .
and yet its threat to back out of the mandate has met with a disproportionately loud and resounding cry of concern from the international community .
european leaders have been especially outspoken in their criticism of the us .
they fear that the american veto of bosnia and its insistence on legal immunity for soldiers participating in the mission could be indicative of the way washington will respond to other un peacekeeping missions .
such a stance would threaten to " damage the authority of the united nations , " said germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer .
danish foreign minister per stig moller , whose country holds the eu ’ s rotating presidency , emphasized the need to find a " satisfactory solution that does not harm the integrity of the icc and which allows for the continuation of un peacekeeping operations and preserves the us engagement in them . "
un secretary general kofi annan warned the us against putting the entire peacekeeping system at risk over what he said were " exaggerated us fears of vulnerability to the new icc " .
the dispute over bosnia is likely to expand to other un peacekeeping missions .
in the upcoming days and weeks , the future of four more un peacekeeping missions will come up for voting in the security council : georgia , lebanon , west-sahara and the region of prevlaka , which is claimed by both croatia and montenegro .
in each case , the us is either directly involved with personnel or has contributed financially to the mission .
prevlaka in addition to the bosnia and kosovo missions in the balkans , the un also has a peacekeeping mandate for the prevlaka peninsula .
it was established in 1996 to monitor a cease-fire between croatia and montenegro , which have been fighting for possession of the region since the former yugoslavia began breaking up in the early 1990s .
there are 27 military observers stationed in prevlaka , but no americans .
the cost for the mission is $ 143 million .
on july 15 , the security council will vote on whether or not to extend the mission .
lebanon in 1978 , after israel ’ s military invasion and occupation of lebanon , the un security council called for the establishment of an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon .
the mission has been active in the region ever since .
the troops are responsible for verifying israel ’ s withdrawal from lebanon and monitoring the peaceful transition to lebanese self-government in the region .
given the current situation in the middle east , the mission is one of the more volatile ones , and the political situation is still uncertain .
since the mission began , there have been 245 fatalities .
approximately 3,600 uniformed troops , 50 military observers an 120 international civilians are involved in the mission .
no americans are participating .
the annual cost for maintaining the peacekeepers is $ 143 .
on july 31 , the security council will convene for a vote on the future of the mission .
georgia un peacekeepers have been stationed in the former soviet republic of georgia since 1993 .
they are primarily responsible for patrolling the territory fought over by government and separatist forces .

108 military observers and 96 international civilians are involved in the mission .
the us has sent two observers .
the annual budget is 27.9 million .
on july 31 , the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension .
western sahara the united nations has been seeking a peaceful solution to the territorial conflict over western sahara since the withdrawal of spain in 1976 and the ensuing fighting between morocco , which had " reintegrated " the territory and the polisario front , which is supported by algeria .
in 1991 , the security council voted to send peacekeepers to the region to monitor the cease-fire between morocco and the polisario separatists .
there are 255 uniformed troops , 204 military observers and 173 international civilians stationed in the region .
10 un personnel have been killed since the mission began .
the annual cost is $ 50.5 million .
the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension on july 31 .
few troops , big monetary contributions compared to the other 86 countries involved in un peacekeeping missions , the us sends very few personnel .
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed worldwide , only 704 are american .
of these , 670 are civilian police , and the majority are stationed on the balkans .
in total , the us personnel contribution constitutes only three percent of the overall un peacekeeping contingent .
this is far less than countries such as bangladesh and pakistan , which contribute 5,479 and 4,831 peacekeepers respectively .
but when it comes to financial support , the us far outdoes the rest of the un members .
america pays for more than one third of the un ’ s peacekeeping expenses -lrb- $ 2.77 billion for 2001-2002 -rrb- .
for this reason , the international community is concerned about that the dispute over bosnia could expand to include other upcoming missions .

but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping . in the course of debate surrounding the international criminal court , the united states threatened to use its veto power in the un security council to block the continuation of the bosnia mandate beyond the july 3rd deadline .
earlier in the week , washington had warned the international body , that it would remove its personnel from the mission if its soldiers were not granted judicial immunity from newly established icc .
at the last moment , however , the 15 member security council managed to extend the deadline for the vote until july 15 .
in the meantime , the fate of the bosnia mission hangs in balance as international talks continue to focus on persuading the us to stick with the mission and others like it .
dispute over bosnia set up in 1995 , the un bosnia mission is an international police task force , for which more than 1,500 police officers and 1,700 civilians have been sent to the region .
their task is to maintain law enforcement , coordinate humanitarian relief , aid refugees , oversee elections and help rebuild the country ’ s destroyed infrastructure .
the united states is represented in bosnia by a mini-contingent of only 46 people .
and yet its threat to back out of the mandate has met with a disproportionately loud and resounding cry of concern from the international community .
european leaders have been especially outspoken in their criticism of the us .
they fear that the american veto of bosnia and its insistence on legal immunity for soldiers participating in the mission could be indicative of the way washington will respond to other un peacekeeping missions .
such a stance would threaten to " damage the authority of the united nations , " said germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer .
danish foreign minister per stig moller , whose country holds the eu ’ s rotating presidency , emphasized the need to find a " satisfactory solution that does not harm the integrity of the icc and which allows for the continuation of un peacekeeping operations and preserves the us engagement in them . "
un secretary general kofi annan warned the us against putting the entire peacekeeping system at risk over what he said were " exaggerated us fears of vulnerability to the new icc " .
the dispute over bosnia is likely to expand to other un peacekeeping missions .
in the upcoming days and weeks , the future of four more un peacekeeping missions will come up for voting in the security council : georgia , lebanon , west-sahara and the region of prevlaka , which is claimed by both croatia and montenegro .
in each case , the us is either directly involved with personnel or has contributed financially to the mission .
prevlaka in addition to the bosnia and kosovo missions in the balkans , the un also has a peacekeeping mandate for the prevlaka peninsula .
it was established in 1996 to monitor a cease-fire between croatia and montenegro , which have been fighting for possession of the region since the former yugoslavia began breaking up in the early 1990s .
there are 27 military observers stationed in prevlaka , but no americans .
the cost for the mission is $ 143 million .
on july 15 , the security council will vote on whether or not to extend the mission .
lebanon in 1978 , after israel ’ s military invasion and occupation of lebanon , the un security council called for the establishment of an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon .
the mission has been active in the region ever since .
the troops are responsible for verifying israel ’ s withdrawal from lebanon and monitoring the peaceful transition to lebanese self-government in the region .
given the current situation in the middle east , the mission is one of the more volatile ones , and the political situation is still uncertain .
since the mission began , there have been 245 fatalities .
approximately 3,600 uniformed troops , 50 military observers an 120 international civilians are involved in the mission .
no americans are participating .
the annual cost for maintaining the peacekeepers is $ 143 .
on july 31 , the security council will convene for a vote on the future of the mission .
georgia un peacekeepers have been stationed in the former soviet republic of georgia since 1993 .

108 military observers and 96 international civilians are involved in the mission .
the us has sent two observers .
the annual budget is 27.9 million .
on july 31 , the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension .
western sahara the united nations has been seeking a peaceful solution to the territorial conflict over western sahara since the withdrawal of spain in 1976 and the ensuing fighting between morocco , which had " reintegrated " the territory and the polisario front , which is supported by algeria .
in 1991 , the security council voted to send peacekeepers to the region to monitor the cease-fire between morocco and the polisario separatists .
there are 255 uniformed troops , 204 military observers and 173 international civilians stationed in the region .
10 un personnel have been killed since the mission began .
the annual cost is $ 50.5 million .
the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension on july 31 .
few troops , big monetary contributions compared to the other 86 countries involved in un peacekeeping missions , the us sends very few personnel .
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed worldwide , only 704 are american .
of these , 670 are civilian police , and the majority are stationed on the balkans .
in total , the us personnel contribution constitutes only three percent of the overall un peacekeeping contingent .
this is far less than countries such as bangladesh and pakistan , which contribute 5,479 and 4,831 peacekeepers respectively .
but when it comes to financial support , the us far outdoes the rest of the un members .
america pays for more than one third of the un ’ s peacekeeping expenses -lrb- $ 2.77 billion for 2001-2002 -rrb- .
for this reason , the international community is concerned about that the dispute over bosnia could expand to include other upcoming missions .

but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping . in the course of debate surrounding the international criminal court , the united states threatened to use its veto power in the un security council to block the continuation of the bosnia mandate beyond the july 3rd deadline .
earlier in the week , washington had warned the international body , that it would remove its personnel from the mission if its soldiers were not granted judicial immunity from newly established icc .
at the last moment , however , the 15 member security council managed to extend the deadline for the vote until july 15 .
in the meantime , the fate of the bosnia mission hangs in balance as international talks continue to focus on persuading the us to stick with the mission and others like it .
dispute over bosnia set up in 1995 , the un bosnia mission is an international police task force , for which more than 1,500 police officers and 1,700 civilians have been sent to the region .
their task is to maintain law enforcement , coordinate humanitarian relief , aid refugees , oversee elections and help rebuild the country ’ s destroyed infrastructure .
the united states is represented in bosnia by a mini-contingent of only 46 people .
and yet its threat to back out of the mandate has met with a disproportionately loud and resounding cry of concern from the international community .
european leaders have been especially outspoken in their criticism of the us .
they fear that the american veto of bosnia and its insistence on legal immunity for soldiers participating in the mission could be indicative of the way washington will respond to other un peacekeeping missions .
such a stance would threaten to " damage the authority of the united nations , " said germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer .
danish foreign minister per stig moller , whose country holds the eu ’ s rotating presidency , emphasized the need to find a " satisfactory solution that does not harm the integrity of the icc and which allows for the continuation of un peacekeeping operations and preserves the us engagement in them . "
un secretary general kofi annan warned the us against putting the entire peacekeeping system at risk over what he said were " exaggerated us fears of vulnerability to the new icc " .
the dispute over bosnia is likely to expand to other un peacekeeping missions .
in the upcoming days and weeks , the future of four more un peacekeeping missions will come up for voting in the security council : georgia , lebanon , west-sahara and the region of prevlaka , which is claimed by both croatia and montenegro .
in each case , the us is either directly involved with personnel or has contributed financially to the mission .
prevlaka in addition to the bosnia and kosovo missions in the balkans , the un also has a peacekeeping mandate for the prevlaka peninsula .
it was established in 1996 to monitor a cease-fire between croatia and montenegro , which have been fighting for possession of the region since the former yugoslavia began breaking up in the early 1990s .
there are 27 military observers stationed in prevlaka , but no americans .
the cost for the mission is $ 143 million .
on july 15 , the security council will vote on whether or not to extend the mission .
lebanon in 1978 , after israel ’ s military invasion and occupation of lebanon , the un security council called for the establishment of an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon .
the mission has been active in the region ever since .
the troops are responsible for verifying israel ’ s withdrawal from lebanon and monitoring the peaceful transition to lebanese self-government in the region .
given the current situation in the middle east , the mission is one of the more volatile ones , and the political situation is still uncertain .
since the mission began , there have been 245 fatalities .
approximately 3,600 uniformed troops , 50 military observers an 120 international civilians are involved in the mission .
no americans are participating .
the annual cost for maintaining the peacekeepers is $ 143 .
on july 31 , the security council will convene for a vote on the future of the mission .
georgia un peacekeepers have been stationed in the former soviet republic of georgia since 1993 .
they are primarily responsible for patrolling the territory fought over by government and separatist forces .
there have been seven fatalities in the last nine years .
108 military observers and 96 international civilians are involved in the mission .
the us has sent two observers .
the annual budget is 27.9 million .
on july 31 , the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension .
western sahara the united nations has been seeking a peaceful solution to the territorial conflict over western sahara since the withdrawal of spain in 1976 and the ensuing fighting between morocco , which had " reintegrated " the territory and the polisario front , which is supported by algeria .
in 1991 , the security council voted to send peacekeepers to the region to monitor the cease-fire between morocco and the polisario separatists .
there are 255 uniformed troops , 204 military observers and 173 international civilians stationed in the region .
10 un personnel have been killed since the mission began .
the annual cost is $ 50.5 million .
the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension on july 31 .
few troops , big monetary contributions compared to the other 86 countries involved in un peacekeeping missions , the us sends very few personnel .
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed worldwide , only 704 are american .
of these , 670 are civilian police , and the majority are stationed on the balkans .
in total , the us personnel contribution constitutes only three percent of the overall un peacekeeping contingent .
this is far less than countries such as bangladesh and pakistan , which contribute 5,479 and 4,831 peacekeepers respectively .
but when it comes to financial support , the us far outdoes the rest of the un members .
america pays for more than one third of the un ’ s peacekeeping expenses -lrb- $ 2.77 billion for 2001-2002 -rrb- .
for this reason , the international community is concerned about that the dispute over bosnia could expand to include other upcoming missions .

but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping . in the course of debate surrounding the international criminal court , the united states threatened to use its veto power in the un security council to block the continuation of the bosnia mandate beyond the july 3rd deadline .
earlier in the week , washington had warned the international body , that it would remove its personnel from the mission if its soldiers were not granted judicial immunity from newly established icc .
at the last moment , however , the 15 member security council managed to extend the deadline for the vote until july 15 .
in the meantime , the fate of the bosnia mission hangs in balance as international talks continue to focus on persuading the us to stick with the mission and others like it .
dispute over bosnia set up in 1995 , the un bosnia mission is an international police task force , for which more than 1,500 police officers and 1,700 civilians have been sent to the region .
their task is to maintain law enforcement , coordinate humanitarian relief , aid refugees , oversee elections and help rebuild the country ’ s destroyed infrastructure .
the united states is represented in bosnia by a mini-contingent of only 46 people .
and yet its threat to back out of the mandate has met with a disproportionately loud and resounding cry of concern from the international community .
european leaders have been especially outspoken in their criticism of the us .
they fear that the american veto of bosnia and its insistence on legal immunity for soldiers participating in the mission could be indicative of the way washington will respond to other un peacekeeping missions .
such a stance would threaten to " damage the authority of the united nations , " said germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer .
danish foreign minister per stig moller , whose country holds the eu ’ s rotating presidency , emphasized the need to find a " satisfactory solution that does not harm the integrity of the icc and which allows for the continuation of un peacekeeping operations and preserves the us engagement in them . "
un secretary general kofi annan warned the us against putting the entire peacekeeping system at risk over what he said were " exaggerated us fears of vulnerability to the new icc " .
the dispute over bosnia is likely to expand to other un peacekeeping missions .
in the upcoming days and weeks , the future of four more un peacekeeping missions will come up for voting in the security council : georgia , lebanon , west-sahara and the region of prevlaka , which is claimed by both croatia and montenegro .
in each case , the us is either directly involved with personnel or has contributed financially to the mission .
prevlaka in addition to the bosnia and kosovo missions in the balkans , the un also has a peacekeeping mandate for the prevlaka peninsula .
it was established in 1996 to monitor a cease-fire between croatia and montenegro , which have been fighting for possession of the region since the former yugoslavia began breaking up in the early 1990s .
there are 27 military observers stationed in prevlaka , but no americans .
the cost for the mission is $ 143 million .
on july 15 , the security council will vote on whether or not to extend the mission .
lebanon in 1978 , after israel ’ s military invasion and occupation of lebanon , the un security council called for the establishment of an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon .
the mission has been active in the region ever since .
the troops are responsible for verifying israel ’ s withdrawal from lebanon and monitoring the peaceful transition to lebanese self-government in the region .
given the current situation in the middle east , the mission is one of the more volatile ones , and the political situation is still uncertain .
since the mission began , there have been 245 fatalities .
approximately 3,600 uniformed troops , 50 military observers an 120 international civilians are involved in the mission .
no americans are participating .
the annual cost for maintaining the peacekeepers is $ 143 .
on july 31 , the security council will convene for a vote on the future of the mission .
georgia un peacekeepers have been stationed in the former soviet republic of georgia since 1993 .
they are primarily responsible for patrolling the territory fought over by government and separatist forces .
there have been seven fatalities in the last nine years .
108 military observers and 96 international civilians are involved in the mission .
the us has sent two observers .
the annual budget is 27.9 million .
on july 31 , the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension .
western sahara the united nations has been seeking a peaceful solution to the territorial conflict over western sahara since the withdrawal of spain in 1976 and the ensuing fighting between morocco , which had " reintegrated " the territory and the polisario front , which is supported by algeria .
in 1991 , the security council voted to send peacekeepers to the region to monitor the cease-fire between morocco and the polisario separatists .
there are 255 uniformed troops , 204 military observers and 173 international civilians stationed in the region .
10 un personnel have been killed since the mission began .
the annual cost is $ 50.5 million .
the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension on july 31 .
few troops , big monetary contributions compared to the other 86 countries involved in un peacekeeping missions , the us sends very few personnel .
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed worldwide , only 704 are american .
of these , 670 are civilian police , and the majority are stationed on the balkans .
in total , the us personnel contribution constitutes only three percent of the overall un peacekeeping contingent .
this is far less than countries such as bangladesh and pakistan , which contribute 5,479 and 4,831 peacekeepers respectively .
but when it comes to financial support , the us far outdoes the rest of the un members .
america pays for more than one third of the un ’ s peacekeeping expenses -lrb- $ 2.77 billion for 2001-2002 -rrb- .
for this reason , the international community is concerned about that the dispute over bosnia could expand to include other upcoming missions .

but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping . in the course of debate surrounding the international criminal court , the united states threatened to use its veto power in the un security council to block the continuation of the bosnia mandate beyond the july 3rd deadline .
earlier in the week , washington had warned the international body , that it would remove its personnel from the mission if its soldiers were not granted judicial immunity from newly established icc .
at the last moment , however , the 15 member security council managed to extend the deadline for the vote until july 15 .
in the meantime , the fate of the bosnia mission hangs in balance as international talks continue to focus on persuading the us to stick with the mission and others like it .
dispute over bosnia set up in 1995 , the un bosnia mission is an international police task force , for which more than 1,500 police officers and 1,700 civilians have been sent to the region .
their task is to maintain law enforcement , coordinate humanitarian relief , aid refugees , oversee elections and help rebuild the country ’ s destroyed infrastructure .
the united states is represented in bosnia by a mini-contingent of only 46 people .
and yet its threat to back out of the mandate has met with a disproportionately loud and resounding cry of concern from the international community .
european leaders have been especially outspoken in their criticism of the us .
they fear that the american veto of bosnia and its insistence on legal immunity for soldiers participating in the mission could be indicative of the way washington will respond to other un peacekeeping missions .
such a stance would threaten to " damage the authority of the united nations , " said germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer .
danish foreign minister per stig moller , whose country holds the eu ’ s rotating presidency , emphasized the need to find a " satisfactory solution that does not harm the integrity of the icc and which allows for the continuation of un peacekeeping operations and preserves the us engagement in them . "
un secretary general kofi annan warned the us against putting the entire peacekeeping system at risk over what he said were " exaggerated us fears of vulnerability to the new icc " .
the dispute over bosnia is likely to expand to other un peacekeeping missions .
in the upcoming days and weeks , the future of four more un peacekeeping missions will come up for voting in the security council : georgia , lebanon , west-sahara and the region of prevlaka , which is claimed by both croatia and montenegro .
in each case , the us is either directly involved with personnel or has contributed financially to the mission .
prevlaka in addition to the bosnia and kosovo missions in the balkans , the un also has a peacekeeping mandate for the prevlaka peninsula .
it was established in 1996 to monitor a cease-fire between croatia and montenegro , which have been fighting for possession of the region since the former yugoslavia began breaking up in the early 1990s .
there are 27 military observers stationed in prevlaka , but no americans .
the cost for the mission is $ 143 million .
on july 15 , the security council will vote on whether or not to extend the mission .
lebanon in 1978 , after israel ’ s military invasion and occupation of lebanon , the un security council called for the establishment of an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon .
the mission has been active in the region ever since .
the troops are responsible for verifying israel ’ s withdrawal from lebanon and monitoring the peaceful transition to lebanese self-government in the region .
given the current situation in the middle east , the mission is one of the more volatile ones , and the political situation is still uncertain .
since the mission began , there have been 245 fatalities .
approximately 3,600 uniformed troops , 50 military observers an 120 international civilians are involved in the mission .
no americans are participating .
the annual cost for maintaining the peacekeepers is $ 143 .
on july 31 , the security council will convene for a vote on the future of the mission .
georgia un peacekeepers have been stationed in the former soviet republic of georgia since 1993 .
they are primarily responsible for patrolling the territory fought over by government and separatist forces .

108 military observers and 96 international civilians are involved in the mission .
the us has sent two observers .
the annual budget is 27.9 million .
on july 31 , the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension .
western sahara the united nations has been seeking a peaceful solution to the territorial conflict over western sahara since the withdrawal of spain in 1976 and the ensuing fighting between morocco , which had " reintegrated " the territory and the polisario front , which is supported by algeria .
in 1991 , the security council voted to send peacekeepers to the region to monitor the cease-fire between morocco and the polisario separatists .
there are 255 uniformed troops , 204 military observers and 173 international civilians stationed in the region .
10 un personnel have been killed since the mission began .
the annual cost is $ 50.5 million .
the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension on july 31 .
few troops , big monetary contributions compared to the other 86 countries involved in un peacekeeping missions , the us sends very few personnel .
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed worldwide , only 704 are american .
of these , 670 are civilian police , and the majority are stationed on the balkans .
in total , the us personnel contribution constitutes only three percent of the overall un peacekeeping contingent .
this is far less than countries such as bangladesh and pakistan , which contribute 5,479 and 4,831 peacekeepers respectively .
but when it comes to financial support , the us far outdoes the rest of the un members .
america pays for more than one third of the un ’ s peacekeeping expenses -lrb- $ 2.77 billion for 2001-2002 -rrb- .
for this reason , the international community is concerned about that the dispute over bosnia could expand to include other upcoming missions .

but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping . in the course of debate surrounding the international criminal court , the united states threatened to use its veto power in the un security council to block the continuation of the bosnia mandate beyond the july 3rd deadline .
earlier in the week , washington had warned the international body , that it would remove its personnel from the mission if its soldiers were not granted judicial immunity from newly established icc .
at the last moment , however , the 15 member security council managed to extend the deadline for the vote until july 15 .
in the meantime , the fate of the bosnia mission hangs in balance as international talks continue to focus on persuading the us to stick with the mission and others like it .
dispute over bosnia set up in 1995 , the un bosnia mission is an international police task force , for which more than 1,500 police officers and 1,700 civilians have been sent to the region .
their task is to maintain law enforcement , coordinate humanitarian relief , aid refugees , oversee elections and help rebuild the country ’ s destroyed infrastructure .
the united states is represented in bosnia by a mini-contingent of only 46 people .
and yet its threat to back out of the mandate has met with a disproportionately loud and resounding cry of concern from the international community .
european leaders have been especially outspoken in their criticism of the us .
they fear that the american veto of bosnia and its insistence on legal immunity for soldiers participating in the mission could be indicative of the way washington will respond to other un peacekeeping missions .
such a stance would threaten to " damage the authority of the united nations , " said germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer .
danish foreign minister per stig moller , whose country holds the eu ’ s rotating presidency , emphasized the need to find a " satisfactory solution that does not harm the integrity of the icc and which allows for the continuation of un peacekeeping operations and preserves the us engagement in them . "
un secretary general kofi annan warned the us against putting the entire peacekeeping system at risk over what he said were " exaggerated us fears of vulnerability to the new icc " .
the dispute over bosnia is likely to expand to other un peacekeeping missions .
in the upcoming days and weeks , the future of four more un peacekeeping missions will come up for voting in the security council : georgia , lebanon , west-sahara and the region of prevlaka , which is claimed by both croatia and montenegro .
in each case , the us is either directly involved with personnel or has contributed financially to the mission .
prevlaka in addition to the bosnia and kosovo missions in the balkans , the un also has a peacekeeping mandate for the prevlaka peninsula .
it was established in 1996 to monitor a cease-fire between croatia and montenegro , which have been fighting for possession of the region since the former yugoslavia began breaking up in the early 1990s .
there are 27 military observers stationed in prevlaka , but no americans .
the cost for the mission is $ 143 million .
on july 15 , the security council will vote on whether or not to extend the mission .
lebanon in 1978 , after israel ’ s military invasion and occupation of lebanon , the un security council called for the establishment of an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon .
the mission has been active in the region ever since .
the troops are responsible for verifying israel ’ s withdrawal from lebanon and monitoring the peaceful transition to lebanese self-government in the region .
given the current situation in the middle east , the mission is one of the more volatile ones , and the political situation is still uncertain .
since the mission began , there have been 245 fatalities .
approximately 3,600 uniformed troops , 50 military observers an 120 international civilians are involved in the mission .
no americans are participating .
the annual cost for maintaining the peacekeepers is $ 143 .
on july 31 , the security council will convene for a vote on the future of the mission .
georgia un peacekeepers have been stationed in the former soviet republic of georgia since 1993 .
they are primarily responsible for patrolling the territory fought over by government and separatist forces .

108 military observers and 96 international civilians are involved in the mission .
the us has sent two observers .
the annual budget is 27.9 million .
on july 31 , the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension .
western sahara the united nations has been seeking a peaceful solution to the territorial conflict over western sahara since the withdrawal of spain in 1976 and the ensuing fighting between morocco , which had " reintegrated " the territory and the polisario front , which is supported by algeria .
in 1991 , the security council voted to send peacekeepers to the region to monitor the cease-fire between morocco and the polisario separatists .
there are 255 uniformed troops , 204 military observers and 173 international civilians stationed in the region .
10 un personnel have been killed since the mission began .
the annual cost is $ 50.5 million .
the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension on july 31 .
few troops , big monetary contributions compared to the other 86 countries involved in un peacekeeping missions , the us sends very few personnel .
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed worldwide , only 704 are american .
of these , 670 are civilian police , and the majority are stationed on the balkans .
in total , the us personnel contribution constitutes only three percent of the overall un peacekeeping contingent .
this is far less than countries such as bangladesh and pakistan , which contribute 5,479 and 4,831 peacekeepers respectively .
but when it comes to financial support , the us far outdoes the rest of the un members .
america pays for more than one third of the un ’ s peacekeeping expenses -lrb- $ 2.77 billion for 2001-2002 -rrb- .
for this reason , the international community is concerned about that the dispute over bosnia could expand to include other upcoming missions .

but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping . in the course of debate surrounding the international criminal court , the united states threatened to use its veto power in the un security council to block the continuation of the bosnia mandate beyond the july 3rd deadline .
earlier in the week , washington had warned the international body , that it would remove its personnel from the mission if its soldiers were not granted judicial immunity from newly established icc .
at the last moment , however , the 15 member security council managed to extend the deadline for the vote until july 15 .
in the meantime , the fate of the bosnia mission hangs in balance as international talks continue to focus on persuading the us to stick with the mission and others like it .
dispute over bosnia set up in 1995 , the un bosnia mission is an international police task force , for which more than 1,500 police officers and 1,700 civilians have been sent to the region .
their task is to maintain law enforcement , coordinate humanitarian relief , aid refugees , oversee elections and help rebuild the country ’ s destroyed infrastructure .
the united states is represented in bosnia by a mini-contingent of only 46 people .
and yet its threat to back out of the mandate has met with a disproportionately loud and resounding cry of concern from the international community .
european leaders have been especially outspoken in their criticism of the us .
they fear that the american veto of bosnia and its insistence on legal immunity for soldiers participating in the mission could be indicative of the way washington will respond to other un peacekeeping missions .
such a stance would threaten to " damage the authority of the united nations , " said germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer .
danish foreign minister per stig moller , whose country holds the eu ’ s rotating presidency , emphasized the need to find a " satisfactory solution that does not harm the integrity of the icc and which allows for the continuation of un peacekeeping operations and preserves the us engagement in them . "
un secretary general kofi annan warned the us against putting the entire peacekeeping system at risk over what he said were " exaggerated us fears of vulnerability to the new icc " .
the dispute over bosnia is likely to expand to other un peacekeeping missions .
in the upcoming days and weeks , the future of four more un peacekeeping missions will come up for voting in the security council : georgia , lebanon , west-sahara and the region of prevlaka , which is claimed by both croatia and montenegro .
in each case , the us is either directly involved with personnel or has contributed financially to the mission .
prevlaka in addition to the bosnia and kosovo missions in the balkans , the un also has a peacekeeping mandate for the prevlaka peninsula .
it was established in 1996 to monitor a cease-fire between croatia and montenegro , which have been fighting for possession of the region since the former yugoslavia began breaking up in the early 1990s .
there are 27 military observers stationed in prevlaka , but no americans .
the cost for the mission is $ 143 million .
on july 15 , the security council will vote on whether or not to extend the mission .
lebanon in 1978 , after israel ’ s military invasion and occupation of lebanon , the un security council called for the establishment of an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon .
the mission has been active in the region ever since .
the troops are responsible for verifying israel ’ s withdrawal from lebanon and monitoring the peaceful transition to lebanese self-government in the region .
given the current situation in the middle east , the mission is one of the more volatile ones , and the political situation is still uncertain .
since the mission began , there have been 245 fatalities .
approximately 3,600 uniformed troops , 50 military observers an 120 international civilians are involved in the mission .
no americans are participating .
the annual cost for maintaining the peacekeepers is $ 143 .
on july 31 , the security council will convene for a vote on the future of the mission .
georgia un peacekeepers have been stationed in the former soviet republic of georgia since 1993 .
they are primarily responsible for patrolling the territory fought over by government and separatist forces .
there have been seven fatalities in the last nine years .
108 military observers and 96 international civilians are involved in the mission .
the us has sent two observers .
the annual budget is 27.9 million .
on july 31 , the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension .
western sahara the united nations has been seeking a peaceful solution to the territorial conflict over western sahara since the withdrawal of spain in 1976 and the ensuing fighting between morocco , which had " reintegrated " the territory and the polisario front , which is supported by algeria .
in 1991 , the security council voted to send peacekeepers to the region to monitor the cease-fire between morocco and the polisario separatists .
there are 255 uniformed troops , 204 military observers and 173 international civilians stationed in the region .
10 un personnel have been killed since the mission began .
the annual cost is $ 50.5 million .
the security council will vote on the mission ’ s extension on july 31 .
few troops , big monetary contributions compared to the other 86 countries involved in un peacekeeping missions , the us sends very few personnel .
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed worldwide , only 704 are american .
of these , 670 are civilian police , and the majority are stationed on the balkans .
in total , the us personnel contribution constitutes only three percent of the overall un peacekeeping contingent .
this is far less than countries such as bangladesh and pakistan , which contribute 5,479 and 4,831 peacekeepers respectively .
but when it comes to financial support , the us far outdoes the rest of the un members .
america pays for more than one third of the un ’ s peacekeeping expenses -lrb- $ 2.77 billion for 2001-2002 -rrb- .
for this reason , the international community is concerned about that the dispute over bosnia could expand to include other upcoming missions .

staff at two caparo plants owned by labour peer lord paul will begin a work to rule on wednesday ahead of a one-day strike on 17 july .
all are members of the iron and steel trades confederation -lrb- istc -rrb- and will continue to strike for one day a week until the dispute is settled .
i hope that a company which prides itself on its family values will see sense and stop this unnecessary action michael leahy , istc union unions have been warning that workers were prepared to take action to defend final salary pensions , but the istc members will be the first to strike .
the factories affected are based in scunthorpe and tredegar in south wales .
the union 's general secretary michael leahy said workers felt angry and were determined to resist the proposal because it threatened their security in retirement .
he said : " i hope that a company which prides itself on its family values will see sense and stop this unnecessary action . "
lord paul has said he was baffled by the industrial action because he believed the two sides were still seeking a settlement .
final salary schemes are commonly seen as the most generous and most secure type of pension because they are supposed to guarantee an income in retirement .
however , the pensions advisory service -lrb- opas -rrb- recently warned that staff risked losing their life savings with these schemes if their employer goes bust .

humera khan , a government adviser on muslim affairs , says the investigation into riots in bradford - which happened exactly a year ago - was a missed opportunity to look into islamophobia .
she told the bbc there should have been stronger recommendations in the final report urging national debate on islamophobia .
her comments come after a labour mp sparked controversy by claiming asian youth gangs are lawless and out of control .
ms khan also believes muslims are discriminated against and can not access services or money to set up projects .
she says this was one of the main reasons the riots took place .
earlier , ann cryer , who represents keighley in west yorkshire , said there is more violence in the asian community than in the white community . "
her agenda is an agenda for damaging race relations " shahid malik , her remarks were immediately denounced as " offensive " and " extremely dangerous " by labour party national executive committee member shahid malik .
" her agenda is an agenda for damaging race relations , " he said .
mr malik , from burnley , said the comments were " extremely dangerous stereotyping of race , completely irresponsible and profoundly counter-productive " .
he said ms cryer had failed the ethnic community in keighley and called on the mp 's constituents to " stand up against " her .
' no fear ' ms cryer criticised leading representatives of the asian communities in the north of the country for burying their heads in the sand and not acknowledging there is a problem .
she also accused the asian community of allowing youth gangs in northern england to run amok without fear of reprisal . "
some leaders pretend it is just as bad in the white community , but we do not have this degree of killing and violence in the white community " ann cryer " -lrb- gang members -rrb- have no fear of the law as they assume the asian community 's loyalty will protect them , " she said .

humera khan , a government adviser on muslim affairs , says the investigation into riots in bradford - which happened exactly a year ago - was a missed opportunity to look into islamophobia .
she told the bbc there should have been stronger recommendations in the final report urging national debate on islamophobia .
her comments come after a labour mp sparked controversy by claiming asian youth gangs are lawless and out of control .
ms khan also believes muslims are discriminated against and can not access services or money to set up projects .
she says this was one of the main reasons the riots took place .
earlier , ann cryer , who represents keighley in west yorkshire , said there is more violence in the asian community than in the white community .
her agenda is an agenda for damaging race relations shahid malik , her remarks were immediately denounced as " offensive " and " extremely dangerous " by labour party national executive committee member shahid malik .
" her agenda is an agenda for damaging race relations , " he said .
mr malik , from burnley , said the comments were " extremely dangerous stereotyping of race , completely irresponsible and profoundly counter-productive " .
he said ms cryer had failed the ethnic community in keighley and called on the mp 's constituents to " stand up against " her .
' no fear ' ms cryer criticised leading representatives of the asian communities in the north of the country for burying their heads in the sand and not acknowledging there is a problem .
she also accused the asian community of allowing youth gangs in northern england to run amok without fear of reprisal .
some leaders pretend it is just as bad in the white community , but we do not have this degree of killing and violence in the white community ann cryer " -lrb- gang members -rrb- have no fear of the law as they assume the asian community 's loyalty will protect them , " she said .

describing the decision to replace him with the former governor of jenin , zuheir manasara , as a " mistake " , jibril rajoub told the bbc that mr arafat had still to contain the anger over the appointment .

the ramallah demonstrators were stopped by israeli troops who now control most of the west bank towns but a delegation was then allowed to go through .

he told the bbc he was not looking for a new appointment himself or a return to his old job .
mr rajoub 's subordinates say his replacement is unworthy of their support earlier he said he might change his mind after next year 's palestinian elections .
mr manasara has been trying to play down the anger over mr arafat 's reshuffle , blaming the media for fanning it .

mr mayall , in an interview with the sunday times , said he had always wanted to play the part of the nazi leader . "
i suppose that if the ss were to march in , i 'd be in the concentration camp , too , for collaboration simply for marrying barbara " rik mayall he said : " actually i only did it because i 'd always wanted to play hitler .
it 's satire .
" look i 'm saying what i say because if hitler tells people to support the euro then surely they wo n't .
that 's the point of it . "
the five second extract of the celebrity-packed anti-euro advert featured mr mayall as hitler saying : " ein volk , ein reich , ein euro " - one people , one realm , one euro - in a reference to the nazi slogan : " ein volk , ein reich , ein fuehrer " .
the comedian then reappears saying in english : " euro ?
oh yes please . "
resisted armada and hitler it has been condemned by politicians , the european commission and jewish groups .
mr mayal denies it is anti-semitic , pointing out that his wife barbara is jewish : " so my children are jewish , too , as the jewish race goes through the mother 's line .
and i suppose that if the ss were to march in , i 'd be in the concentration camp , too , for collaboration simply for marrying barbara . "
as to why he opposes the euro , mr mayall , best known for his 1980s role in the anarchic comedy the young ones , says that it is basically because he is " not a joiner " .
he told the newspaper : " so that means no to joining the euro ...
i 'm an independent sort of person .
if we join the euro then the people in brussels will take even more decisions on our behalf .
" i do n't trust the financiers of europe .
look , britain resisted the armada and , yes , hitler , too .
i like this distance we in britain have .
a little island between america and europe . "
' crass and offensive ' the hitler spoof in the advert led to tony blair being questioned about it in house of commons - but he played down its significance , saying " a joke is a joke " .
he added that he believed economic arguments would win the day on whether the uk adopts the euro - and not celebrities or pop stars . "
it is a harmless comedy sketch for three seconds in a 90 second film " no campaign 'd george eustice the cinema advertisement was described as " offensive " by liberal democrat leader charles kennedy , and has been branded tasteless by leading british jews .
but the anti-euro no campaign argues the celebrity advert was a bit of " harmless fun " in the bid to win people over to its arguments .
the european commission described the advert as " crass and offensive " and in " appallingly bad taste " .
a spokesman said it was " insulting " and " panders to xenophobia " .
the britain in europe group denounced the advertisement as a " tasteless caricature " .
bob geldof its views are shared by the chairman of the holocaust educational trust , labour peer lord janner .
he described the portrayal as " crass , distasteful and totally inappropriate " .
" those responsible should withdraw this offensive advert immediately , " said lord janner .
former european commission vice-president and tory cabinet minister , lord brittan of spennithorne , also criticised the advert .
" this tasteless ad shows the underlying nastiness behind much of the no campaign as well as an element of desperation , " he said .
but the no campaign director george eustice denied the advert was offensive .
" it is a harmless comedy sketch for three seconds in a 90 second film , " he said .
rock star bob geldof , comedians vic reeves , harry enfield and john sessions , chef gordon ramsay , as well as labour mps diane abbott and kate hoey are among those who appear in the video campaign .
