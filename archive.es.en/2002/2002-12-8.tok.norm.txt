they include an aide to the country 's main opposition leader and a prominent writer , although police say they were not directly linked to the attacks .
the explosions took place almost simultaneously at four cinemas in the densely populated town of mymensingh , 110 kilometres -lrb- 70 miles -rrb- north of the capital , dhaka .
a police spokesman said the prime minister , begum khalida zia , would visit the injured in hospital on sunday .
in september , at least two people died and 200 were hurt in bomb blasts at a cinema hall and circus in satkhira , a district town nearly 180 km -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- south of dhaka .
no-one admitted planting those devices .
successive blasts although the devices were crude , this was a well-planned series of attacks which police say was calculated to cause the maximum number of deaths and injuries . "
there were bodies lying in blood and many injured crying for help " jahangir alam , local journalist the cinemas were packed with about 2,000 people who had gone to see bengali films following the eid al-fitr holiday - the muslim festival marking the end of the ramadan month of fasting .
police in dhaka said on sunday they had arrested saber hossain choudhury , an aide to opposition awami league leader sheikh hasina , and writer muntasir mamun .
they were detained for suspicious activities but were not directly linked to the bomb attacks , the police said .
there were also reports that more than 20 people , including some students , had been arrested in mymensingh in connection with the blasts .
the first explosion came at the end of a show at the ajanta theatre and killed two people instantly .
the others happened as shows were still going on .
people ran out of the cinemas screaming for help .
" i heard a big bang and then saw many people running for shelter , " local journalist jahangir alam told the associated press news agency .
" there were bodies lying in blood and many injured crying for help . "
trading accusations the attacks are strikingly similar to the ones last september , when a crowded cinema hall and circus were hit on a saturday evening .
those attacks came amid controversy over claims that the country had become a safe haven for taleban and al-qaeda fighters .
the government and the opposition accused each others ' supporters of having been behind them .
the awami league blamed the attack on a hardline islamic group with links to the government .
mr chowdhury said there were " certain elements in bangladeshi society , it may only be very small elements , who are sympathetic towards the taleban " .
analysts said the satkhira blasts , in turn , were very similar to attacks during the last year of the previous awami league government .
nearly 100 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks on open-air functions , public meetings and on a mosque and a church .
sheikh hasina , then prime minister , accused radical muslim groups for the attacks .

the kuwaiti information minister , sheikh ahmad al-fahd al-sabah , said the message was " an unveiled attempt to create a rift in the united ranks of the kuwaiti people and leadership " .
saddam hussein should confirm his peaceful intentions in words and deeds by implementing all un security council resolutions sheikh ahmad " the speech contained incitement and encouragement of terrorist acts which the whole world has rejected and condemned , " sheikh ahmad told the kuwaiti news agency -lrb- kuna -rrb- .
in the televised statement , read out by iraqi information minister mohamed said sahaf on saturday , saddam hussein said both iraq and kuwait had been victims of the gulf war in 1991 .
he urged the kuwaiti people to support baghdad against " infidel forces " and said they should rise up against " treason " .
praise for militants sheikh ahmad said saddam hussein sought to " encourage acts of terrorism which the whole world deplores " - an apparent reference to the iraqi leader 's praise for kuwaiti militants who recently attacked us troops in the emirate .
we apologise to god for any deed that angered him in the past , which we might not have known of and is blamed on us , and on this basis we also apologise to you saddam hussein " instead of deliberately ignoring the strong bonds tying the kuwaiti leadership and people , saddam hussein should confirm his peaceful intentions in words and deeds by implementing all un security council resolutions pertaining to the invasion of kuwait , " sheikh ahmad said .
bbc regional analyst david bamford says saddam hussein may now believe that , despite the resumption of un weapons inspections , there will be another war with the united states sooner or later , and this is his effort to persuade the arab world to resist .
the us has sent more forces to kuwait referring to the presence of the us troops , saddam hussein said kuwait was under " direct foreign military occupation " and called on kuwaitis to join efforts to expel them .
sheikh ahmad said saddam hussein 's message was like the " political and media campaigns " waged by iraq in the run-up to its august 1990 invasion of kuwait .
the kuwaiti newspaper al-watan denounced the speech as " farcical , " saying " saddam changes colour , but not his nature " .
another kuwaiti paper , al-qabas , said the iraqi leader " is a time bomb that threatens international peace " .
" he did not apologise for the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- occupation .

the kuwaiti information minister , sheikh ahmad al-fahd al-sabah , said the message was " an unveiled attempt to create a rift in the united ranks of the kuwaiti people and leadership " . "
saddam hussein should confirm his peaceful intentions in words and deeds by implementing all un security council resolutions " sheikh ahmad " the speech contained incitement and encouragement of terrorist acts which the whole world has rejected and condemned , " sheikh ahmad told the kuwaiti news agency -lrb- kuna -rrb- .
in the televised statement , read out by iraqi information minister mohamed said sahaf on saturday , saddam hussein said both iraq and kuwait had been victims of the gulf war in 1991 .
he urged the kuwaiti people to support baghdad against " infidel forces " and said they should rise up against " treason " .
praise for militants sheikh ahmad said saddam hussein sought to " encourage acts of terrorism which the whole world deplores " - an apparent reference to the iraqi leader 's praise for kuwaiti militants who recently attacked us troops in the emirate . "
we apologise to god for any deed that angered him in the past , which we might not have known of and is blamed on us , and on this basis we also apologise to you " saddam hussein " instead of deliberately ignoring the strong bonds tying the kuwaiti leadership and people , saddam hussein should confirm his peaceful intentions in words and deeds by implementing all un security council resolutions pertaining to the invasion of kuwait , " sheikh ahmad said .
bbc regional analyst david bamford says saddam hussein may now believe that , despite the resumption of un weapons inspections , there will be another war with the united states sooner or later , and this is his effort to persuade the arab world to resist .
referring to the presence of the us troops , saddam hussein said kuwait was under " direct foreign military occupation " and called on kuwaitis to join efforts to expel them .
sheikh ahmad said saddam hussein 's message was like the " political and media campaigns " waged by iraq in the run-up to its august 1990 invasion of kuwait .
the kuwaiti newspaper al-watan denounced the speech as " farcical , " saying " saddam changes colour , but not his nature " .
another kuwaiti paper , al-qabas , said the iraqi leader " is a time bomb that threatens international peace " .
" he did not apologise for the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- occupation .
the only apology actually revealed his hostile intentions against kuwait , " it said .
