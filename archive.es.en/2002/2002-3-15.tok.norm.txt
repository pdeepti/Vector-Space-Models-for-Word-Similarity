by steve schifferes bbc news online economics reporter the uk 's international development secretary , clare short , has launched a strong attack on us plans for aid to poor countries ahead of an international summit in mexico .
clare short : us plans would ' wreck ' world bank ms short told bbc news online that a us plan to convert aid payments into grants " lots of people say is populist grandstanding " and that it would " wreck " the world bank 's lending programmes to the world 's poorest countries .
the criticism comes as the european union hopes to put pressure on the us to increase the volume of foreign aid at the forthcoming monterrey development summit .
to make progress , we must encourage nations and leaders to walk the hard road of political , legal and economic reform us president george w bush ms short said that the uk had helped the eu to reach agreement on a $ 7bn boost to its own aid budgets by 2006 .
under the deal , eu countries have pledged to increase the amount of its foreign aid as a proportion of gdp to 0.39 % , although individual countries will not be required to reach that target .
meanwhile , president bush has offered a $ 5bn boost in the us foreign aid budget from 2004 , if developing countries pledge to respect human rights and root out corruption .
" to make progress , we must encourage nations and leaders to walk the hard road of political , legal and economic reform so all their people can benefit , " he told latin american leaders .
ms short said she welcomed the pledge of additional aid from the world 's rich countries .
but the row over the future approach to aid threatens to overshadow the positive message world leaders are hoping to send to developing countries , after years of cuts to aid budgets .
deeds , not words the monterrey summit on financing for development , which opens on monday , aims at providing the funds to meet the ambitious development goals agreed by the un - including cutting world poverty in half by 2015 , and improving health and education for the poor .
millennium development goals 50 % reduction in people living on $ 1 per day primary school for all children 67 % reduction in child deaths 75 % cut in maternal deaths halve the number of people without clean water the world bank has estimated that to achieve these goals , total aid flows from rich to poor countries need to increase by $ 40bn- $ 60bn a year .
ms short said she was going to monterrey to convince the americans that aid does work , and that it was vital that extra resources were put on the table to encourage reform in developing countries .
in a paper published jointly with the treasury , her department argues that " as we work together to fight terrorism , we must also work together to address the causes of poverty ; not just because to do so is central to peace and security , but because to do so is right . "
world bank row us treasury secretary paul o 'neill : sceptical of world bank loans the uk and other european countries are worried that us treasury secretary paul o 'neill 's campaign to convert 50 % of all world bank loans for poor countries into grants could undermine the effectiveness of the world 's biggest aid agency , and negate any pledges for more aid .
at present repaid loans are recycled to provide additional aid to poor countries .
with negotiations underway for fresh world bank funding , ms short argues that the resources available to the poor will go further if they borrow the money , and that grants would undermine the whole reform process that has made aid more effective .
but the us claims that too much aid money is wasted by governments , and wants 50 % of future world bank spending to be converted to direct grants to non-governmental organisations .
trade and aid rich countries are also being asked to open their doors to exports from poor countries under a new trade round that was launched last year at doha in the gulf state of qatar .
however , mike moore , the director-general of the world trade organisation , told the bbc that he did not expect any fresh initiatives on trade at monterrey .
the wto is committed to building up the capacity of poor countries to negotiate better trade deals , but still faces a difficult task in convincing the industrial countries to reduce their agricultural subsidies and allow in more developing country products .
falling commodity prices have cut export incomes in some of the world 's poorest countries by 25 % - adding to the problems caused by declining aid levels .

the south wales rock star has defended the attention-grabbing nature of the initiative , called bllcks .
bllck cancer facts 1,600 cases a year 18-35s most at risk 95 % survival rate if detected early the campaign by bbc wales 's education department is supported by the welsh assembly government .
it is aimed at stripping away the stigma surrounding the disease , and urges young men to check themselves for abnormalities .
cwmaman-born musician cable - known for his straight talking and no-nonsense approach - said he was pleased to be taking part in the project .
as well as appearing on posters , cable appears in a series of television promos aimed at the 18-35 year age group .
he talks frankly about testicular cancer , assuring young men that it will not stop them being a " love god " , or prevent them from fathering children .
cable said he hoped the publicity would dispel the embarrassment which dissuaded men from talking about testicular cancer .
" i think it 's a male ego thing , " he said .
" i know for a fact that most blokes do n't check themselves - they think it 's never going to happen to them .
" nobody wants to have some bloke at the doctors feeling your nads .
" but if it 's the difference between life and death , i do n't mind who 's got their hands on my b * ll * cks .
" next time you 're in the bath or shower , check ' em out ! "
there are 1,600 new cases of testicular cancer in britain every year .
but doctors say there is a 95 % success rate if the symptons are caught early enough .
the campaign is being supported by a tv drama , facing demons , starring denise welch , john alderton and vincenzo pellegrino , to be shown on bbc one wales on tuesday 19 march .
a series of five short films about testicular cancer will be shown on bbc wales television from friday .
the initiative is also being promoted via beer mats , credit cards and stress balls .
research published in june 2001 suggested the number of men dying from testicular cancer in the uk had fallen by almost three quarters in less than a decade .
the international study published in medical publication , the lancet , found that only swedish men had enjoyed such a dramatic improvement in their fortunes .
the survey reported that in the uk , between 1975 and 1979 , there were on average 276 deaths a year from testicular cancer .
between 1995 and 1997 , the figure was 96 deaths a year - a fall of 72 % .
however , death rates in the uk were still higher than those in the usa and japan , where the latest treatments became available earlier .

his visit to turkey and syria comes amid increasing speculations that the us-led campaign against terrorism is going to extend to iraq .
in an interview with bbc news online , puk leader jalal talabani described his visit to turkey as " very successful " . "
we are part of the campaign against terrorism all over the world .
we support the struggle against terrorism " jalal talabani " we discussed all the problems with our brothers in turkey and reached a common conclusion about the future of iraq , " he said .
turkish officials have said in the past that if the us attacks iraq , the kurds in the north will establish a state of their own , an act turkey would consider " act of war " .
trying to appease these concerns , mr talabani said : " we explained to them that there were no separatist tendencies in the kurdish movement and that the idea of an independent kurdish state in not realistic . "
" on the contrary , all the kurdish parties are for a united and democratic iraq , " he added .
syrian leg another stopping point in mr talabani 's tour was damascus , where he met president asad and told him the puk is " an iraqi democratic force that is struggling for a democratic iraq and for the national unity of the country " .
" he -lsb- asad -rsb- was satisfied with the explanation , " said mr talabani .
while mr talabani was in damascus , the iraqi vice-president izzat ibrahim was visiting the syrian capital too .
analysts say syria might mediate between the kurds and baghdad as it enjoys good relations with both .
but mr talabani ruled out any connection between the two visits .
" he was here before me .
when i arrived , he had left for beirut , " he said .
earlier this week , iraqi president saddam hussein tried to reach out to the kurds and offered to discuss " improving the autonomy law " .
mr talabani said that he had not seen the text of the statement yet .
war on terror iraq 's kurdish region has been out of saddam hussein 's reach since 1991 and remains under the control of the puk and the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- .
if the us-led war on terror reaches iraq , the kurdish region will have a key role to play , as it could become a base for attacks against baghdad .
but the kurds have been wary of making any statements in this respect for fear of provoking reprisals by saddam hussein 's army .
" we are part of the campaign against terrorism all over the world .
we support the struggle against terrorism , " said mr talabani .
but on the kurdish position with regards to the war being extended to iraq , he said : " we do n't know anything about it .
there is confusion now .
we ca n't decide " " there are no separatist tendencies in the kurdish movement .
all the kurdish parties are for a united and democratic iraq " jalal talabani " the kurdish people must be aware about the future of iraq and the alternative regime .
then we can decide , " he added .
since september 11 , iraqi kurds and baghdad have expressed opposing positions .
iraq is one of few countries that did not condemn the attack or express its support for the war on terror .
meanwhile , the kurds in the north have extended sympathy for the victims and expressed their support for the us-led response .
if the us decides to extend its war on terror to iraq , the kurds will be faced with the tough tasks of choosing between baghdad and washington , and of assuring their neighbours of their non-separatist intentions .

the fight to save the rare bird of prey from extinction began in the town of tregaron .
the red kite has been adopted as a local symbol the red kite centre in the town was forced to close in the summer of 2001 due to the foot-and-mouth crisis .
but the attraction has now reopened in an old school , which local children have helped decorate in tribute to some of the area 's most famous residents .
tregaron bog - cors caron - was once home to the last few surviving pairs of red kites .
in the mid 1980s a feeding programme was launched to save the rare birds from dying out .
the campaign to protect them was so successful that the red kite is fast becoming a common sight in the welsh countryside .
in 2001 , its population was reported to be at its highest for 150 years , with some birds sighted in all counties of wales .
children have helped decorate the new centre however , the red kite remains concentrated on the tywi and cothi valleys of mid and west wales .
a survey by the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- at the end of 2000 revealed that wales remained the stronghold for the red kite in the uk .
it reported there were 259 breeding pairs , compared with 71 pairs ten years earlier .
the bird - known as barcud in welsh - has been adopted as an emblem of mid wales .
tourist officers have been keen to capitalise on interest in the birds to promote the region as " kite country " .
many people visit rural wales to see the red kite other red kite centres in wales include nant yr arian , near aberystwyth , and gigrin farm near rhayader , mid wales .
attempts have been made to re-introduce the bird into other parts of the uk , but with mixed results .

the fight to save the rare bird of prey from extinction began in the town of tregaron .
the red kite centre in the town was forced to close in the summer of 2001 due to the foot-and-mouth crisis .
but the attraction has now reopened in an old school , which local children have helped decorate in tribute to some of the area 's most famous residents .
tregaron bog - cors caron - was once home to the last few surviving pairs of red kites .
in the mid 1980s a feeding programme was launched to save the rare birds from dying out .
the campaign to protect them was so successful that the red kite is fast becoming a common sight in the welsh countryside .
in 2001 , its population was reported to be at its highest for 150 years , with some birds sighted in all counties of wales .
however , the red kite remains concentrated on the tywi and cothi valleys of mid and west wales .
a survey by the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- at the end of 2000 revealed that wales remained the stronghold for the red kite in the uk .
it reported there were 259 breeding pairs , compared with 71 pairs ten years earlier .
the bird - known as barcud in welsh - has been adopted as an emblem of mid wales .
tourist officers have been keen to capitalise on interest in the birds to promote the region as " kite country " .
other red kite centres in wales include nant yr arian , near aberystwyth , and gigrin farm near rhayader , mid wales .
attempts have been made to re-introduce the bird into other parts of the uk , but with mixed results .
in january , the rspb revealed that more than a third of red kites released in scotland had been lost to illegal poisoning .
but the society said there had been more success in breeding the birds in parts of england , including yorkshire and the chilterns .

more than 20 frontline medical staff , senior managers and mps are taking part in the seminars , which will continue until the end of the month .
they include tottenham mp david lammy , whose constituency covered victoria 's home , ratna dutt , director of the race equality unit , rosemarie mcquarrie , a practice nurse , and dr yomi mcewan , a gp .
victoria died in february 2000 after months of abuse by her carers - her great-aunt marie therese kouao and kouao 's boyfriend , carl manning .
her death came despite regular contact with four local authorities , two police child protection teams , two hospitals and social workers .
public 's role the second phase of the inquiry is designed to gather views as to how another case like victoria 's can best be avoided .
the public 's role in the protection of youngsters who are difficult to keep track of , such as those newly arrived in britain , will be examined in the first meeting .
participants will consider what the community can do to help protect children like victoria , who was brought to britain from the ivory coast , and draw them to the attention of local agencies so they can receive services .
the discussion group will also look at how all the different agencies can better work with each other .
radical recommendations on thursday social service leaders called for a " colour-blind " protection system which applied definitions of significant harm to all children , irrespective of their ethnicity or culture .
they said the fact that victoria and both her carers were black had played a part in the failure of professionals to protect her .
staff were concerned about the complexity of the racial and cultural issues , and the implications of " getting it wrong " .
the inquiry is expected to make radical recommendations to reform the system when it reports in september .
the first stage of the inquiry , which looked specifically at victoria 's case , heard from both kouao and manning , who are serving life for victoria 's murder .
