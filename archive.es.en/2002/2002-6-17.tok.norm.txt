" we can not go along with this , even if we wanted to , " he wrote .
he said the additional fiscal liabilities associated with eu expansion could create serious financial difficulties for the current 15 members .

the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states . a week before a major european union summit in seville , spain , german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would not be able to support an agricultural subsidies plan for the ten eu candidate nations recently proposed by the european commission .
" the limit of germany 's financial capacity has been reached , " schröder wrote in an editorial published by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" we can not go along with this , even if we wanted to , " he wrote .
he said the additional fiscal liabilities associated with eu expansion could create serious financial difficulties for the current 15 members .
schröder said germany alone would have to pay an estimated additional two billion euro -lrb- $ 1.88 billion -rrb- into the eu agricultural budget if the union grows to 25 member states after 2004 as planned .
it would be impossible , the chancellor wrote , for germany to foot the bill for agricultural subsidies for the accession states while at the same time eliminating germany 's budget deficit and maintaining a balanced budget by 2004 as required by the eu pact ensuring the stability of the euro .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it ’ s billed as europe ’ s biggest queer event , where gay pride and the " other " way of life comes out in a flurry of parades , music , parties and garish outfits .
cologne the bastion of broad-mindedness " cologne celebrates diversity – let ’ s make europe a place for all of us " – this year ’ s motto of the europride speaks volumes for the rhine metropolis ’ reputation for liberalism and tolerance and its stature as germany ’ s gay capital .
slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .
the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .
their goal is equal rights for all and equal treatments for all ways of life .
that 's what makes the europride and the csd essentially political events albeit ones where the participants sport feather boas , leather trousers and fake lashes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european pride organisers association official website of the europride 2002 in cologne 9797 dw-tv europe live im focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .
the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .
their goal is equal rights for all and equal treatments for all ways of life .
that 's what makes the europride and the csd essentially political events albeit ones where the participants sport feather boas , leather trousers and fake lashes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european pride organisers association official website of the europride 2002 in cologne 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it ’ s billed as europe ’ s biggest queer event , where gay pride and the " other " way of life comes out in a flurry of parades , music , parties and garish outfits .
cologne the bastion of broad-mindedness " cologne celebrates diversity – let ’ s make europe a place for all of us " – this year ’ s motto of the europride speaks volumes for the rhine metropolis ’ reputation for liberalism and tolerance and its stature as germany ’ s gay capital .
slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .
the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .
their goal is equal rights for all and equal treatments for all ways of life .

slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .
the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .
their goal is equal rights for all and equal treatments for all ways of life .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .

the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states . a week before a major european union summit in seville , spain , german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would not be able to support an agricultural subsidies plan for the ten eu candidate nations recently proposed by the european commission .
" the limit of germany 's financial capacity has been reached , " schröder wrote in an editorial published by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" we can not go along with this , even if we wanted to , " he wrote .
he said the additional fiscal liabilities associated with eu expansion could create serious financial difficulties for the current 15 members .
schröder said germany alone would have to pay an estimated additional two billion euro -lrb- $ 1.88 billion -rrb- into the eu agricultural budget if the union grows to 25 member states after 2004 as planned .
it would be impossible , the chancellor wrote , for germany to foot the bill for agricultural subsidies for the accession states while at the same time eliminating germany 's budget deficit and maintaining a balanced budget by 2004 as required by the eu pact ensuring the stability of the euro .
the chancellor said he could not allow that , and urged the eu commission to start giving serious consideration to reforming its agricultural policies .
additionally , schröder said the countries of western and southern europe that have benefitted from subsidies should be called upon to help any new eu members . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less .

the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states . a week before a major european union summit in seville , spain , german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would not be able to support an agricultural subsidies plan for the ten eu candidate nations recently proposed by the european commission .
" the limit of germany 's financial capacity has been reached , " schröder wrote in an editorial published by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" we can not go along with this , even if we wanted to , " he wrote .
he said the additional fiscal liabilities associated with eu expansion could create serious financial difficulties for the current 15 members .
schröder said germany alone would have to pay an estimated additional two billion euro -lrb- $ 1.88 billion -rrb- into the eu agricultural budget if the union grows to 25 member states after 2004 as planned .
it would be impossible , the chancellor wrote , for germany to foot the bill for agricultural subsidies for the accession states while at the same time eliminating germany 's budget deficit and maintaining a balanced budget by 2004 as required by the eu pact ensuring the stability of the euro .
the chancellor said he could not allow that , and urged the eu commission to start giving serious consideration to reforming its agricultural policies .

the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states . a week before a major european union summit in seville , spain , german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would not be able to support an agricultural subsidies plan for the ten eu candidate nations recently proposed by the european commission .
" the limit of germany 's financial capacity has been reached , " schröder wrote in an editorial published by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" we can not go along with this , even if we wanted to , " he wrote .
he said the additional fiscal liabilities associated with eu expansion could create serious financial difficulties for the current 15 members .
schröder said germany alone would have to pay an estimated additional two billion euro -lrb- $ 1.88 billion -rrb- into the eu agricultural budget if the union grows to 25 member states after 2004 as planned .
it would be impossible , the chancellor wrote , for germany to foot the bill for agricultural subsidies for the accession states while at the same time eliminating germany 's budget deficit and maintaining a balanced budget by 2004 as required by the eu pact ensuring the stability of the euro .
the chancellor said he could not allow that , and urged the eu commission to start giving serious consideration to reforming its agricultural policies .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it ’ s billed as europe ’ s biggest queer event , where gay pride and the " other " way of life comes out in a flurry of parades , music , parties and garish outfits .
cologne the bastion of broad-mindedness " cologne celebrates diversity – let ’ s make europe a place for all of us " – this year ’ s motto of the europride speaks volumes for the rhine metropolis ’ reputation for liberalism and tolerance and its stature as germany ’ s gay capital .
slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .

the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it ’ s billed as europe ’ s biggest queer event , where gay pride and the " other " way of life comes out in a flurry of parades , music , parties and garish outfits .
cologne the bastion of broad-mindedness " cologne celebrates diversity – let ’ s make europe a place for all of us " – this year ’ s motto of the europride speaks volumes for the rhine metropolis ’ reputation for liberalism and tolerance and its stature as germany ’ s gay capital .
slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .
the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .

twelve central- and eastern european countries plan to join the eu .
poland is the largest of them and remains the furthest behind in negotiating entry . a few years ago , poland was the economic darling of eastern europe .
it had dodged the recession and currency problems of other former communist nations like hungary and began posting growth percentages that wowed investors .
they reacted by pumping billions into the economy .
unemployment levels were steady , direct investment was high and typically pessimistic poles were awash in optimism as they began negotiating for eu entry in 1998 .
how quickly things change .
growth has slumped , unemployment has soared to 17 percent of the population and the people are starting to express their doubts about eu entry .
all this with the deadline for 2004 entry almost upon them .
poland is the largest and most unwieldy of the 13 countries negotiating for entry into the until-now exclusive western european club .
polish and eu negotiators have clashed repeatedly on a number of conditions for eu entry – laid out in a 80,000 page document .
the farmer ’ s plight the european union is getting impatient with poland ’ s bulldog stance on several key issues , chief among them agriculture and unemployment .
polish eu advocates are as well .
but a heavy resistance among polish farmers and a recent government change have put up major obstacles on the road to progress .

miller pledged to overcome the crisis of the public finances and to set the country on a path of high economic growth .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- the farmers are worried they will become an extinct species when poland gets flooded by agricultural products from highly industrialized eu farms .
the eu , fed up with the 20 percent share agriculture has in the polish labor market , has done nothing to assuage their fears .
product quotas assigned to all eu members promise to be far lower than those of the western states , meaning polish farmers will have a limit to how much they can sell .
they can ’ t depend on the rich subsidies enjoyed by current members either .
the eu has said that candidate countries will receive only 25 percent of the subsidies out of the € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- union agriculture budget that current countries enjoy .
what ’ s more , " polish farmers are not ready to apply and fulfill all the bureaucratic requirements needed to get the subsidies , " chris wietrzny , a farm lobbyist , told dw-world .
" there are only a small amount of farms who can benefit from the subsidies , around 25 percent .
for the rest of the farmers , a difficult period will start , because they will not be able to compete on the external market .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it ’ s billed as europe ’ s biggest queer event , where gay pride and the " other " way of life comes out in a flurry of parades , music , parties and garish outfits .
cologne the bastion of broad-mindedness " cologne celebrates diversity – let ’ s make europe a place for all of us " – this year ’ s motto of the europride speaks volumes for the rhine metropolis ’ reputation for liberalism and tolerance and its stature as germany ’ s gay capital .
slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .
the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .
their goal is equal rights for all and equal treatments for all ways of life .
that 's what makes the europride and the csd essentially political events albeit ones where the participants sport feather boas , leather trousers and fake lashes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european pride organisers association official website of the europride 2002 in cologne 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it ’ s billed as europe ’ s biggest queer event , where gay pride and the " other " way of life comes out in a flurry of parades , music , parties and garish outfits .
cologne the bastion of broad-mindedness " cologne celebrates diversity – let ’ s make europe a place for all of us " – this year ’ s motto of the europride speaks volumes for the rhine metropolis ’ reputation for liberalism and tolerance and its stature as germany ’ s gay capital .
slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .
the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .
their goal is equal rights for all and equal treatments for all ways of life .
that 's what makes the europride and the csd essentially political events albeit ones where the participants sport feather boas , leather trousers and fake lashes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european pride organisers association official website of the europride 2002 in cologne 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it ’ s billed as europe ’ s biggest queer event , where gay pride and the " other " way of life comes out in a flurry of parades , music , parties and garish outfits .
cologne the bastion of broad-mindedness " cologne celebrates diversity – let ’ s make europe a place for all of us " – this year ’ s motto of the europride speaks volumes for the rhine metropolis ’ reputation for liberalism and tolerance and its stature as germany ’ s gay capital .
slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .

levels have climbed from around 13 percent in 1998 to 17 percent of the population in 2001 , according to government statistics .
young people , in particular , are difficult to motivate into employment with many still living off of generous communist-era welfare checks .
state costs will only increase if the country ’ s two million family farms go under because of an inability to transform themselves into the mechanized , mono-crop farms favored by eu member states .
the fact could widen an already significant divide between poland 's well-off city-dwellers and their poverty-stricken countrymen out on the land .
second-class citizens polish laborers were dealt another blow when brussels – in a nod to austria and germany – ruled recently they would have to wait seven years before being allowed to work in eu countries .
that , of course , hasn ’ t stopped polish workers from working illegally in places like germany and austria , who desperately need them for low-level jobs in construction , farm and factory work .
but the ban adds to the opinion among many in the population that poland , if it makes it , comes into the union as a second-class citizen .
the sentiment is a major reason support for eu membership has been waning since poland first applied in 1994 .
government change = new hope ?
still government officials are optimistic – if for no other reason than that there is no other choice . # b # observers note that if new polish prime minister leszek miller -lrb- photo -rrb- doesn ’ t get poland into the union a re-election is pretty much out of the question .
miller , a member of the successor to the former communist party , already faces domestic pressure to lead the country out of the economic swamp poland ’ s previous conservative government mired it in .
there is hope .
miller unlike his predecessor jerzy buzek , has a strong coalition and enjoys a majority in the government .
this has already attracted the attention of investors , who after pumping a record € 14.5 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- into the government in 2000 , have shied away in the past two years .
prime minister miller ’ s appointment of marek belka , an american-trained economist , as his finance minister has also helped matters .
the clock is ticking with more urgency .
the eu wants to wrap up negotiations with candidate countries by the end of this year .
at least 10 of the 29 legislative chapters needed to be completed for poland ’ s eu entry remain open .
the admission of poland into the union , so often history ’ s victim , is something both sides want .
but poland will have to move quickly if it wants to join the club . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de recognition for the polish farmer poland ’ s jadwiga lopata won the environmental community ’ s most prominent prize this week .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it ’ s billed as europe ’ s biggest queer event , where gay pride and the " other " way of life comes out in a flurry of parades , music , parties and garish outfits .
cologne the bastion of broad-mindedness " cologne celebrates diversity – let ’ s make europe a place for all of us " – this year ’ s motto of the europride speaks volumes for the rhine metropolis ’ reputation for liberalism and tolerance and its stature as germany ’ s gay capital .
slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .
the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .
their goal is equal rights for all and equal treatments for all ways of life .

while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week . it ’ s that time of year again in cologne .
no , we ’ re not talking clowns , cherry-shaped noses , masks , painted faces and a city drinking itself silly .
the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it ’ s billed as europe ’ s biggest queer event , where gay pride and the " other " way of life comes out in a flurry of parades , music , parties and garish outfits .
cologne the bastion of broad-mindedness " cologne celebrates diversity – let ’ s make europe a place for all of us " – this year ’ s motto of the europride speaks volumes for the rhine metropolis ’ reputation for liberalism and tolerance and its stature as germany ’ s gay capital .
slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .
the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .

the cathedral city on the banks of the rhine may be better known for its revered carnival institution , but there ’ s another annual celebration that ’ s providing serious competition in terms of turnout , outrageousness and an uninhibited " letting it all hang out " theme .
and to add to it , this one has a strong political message .
for 23 days , from june 15 to july 7 , cologne ’ s gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community will rock the ancient roman city with the europride 2002 which will culminate in the famed christopher street day parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it ’ s billed as europe ’ s biggest queer event , where gay pride and the " other " way of life comes out in a flurry of parades , music , parties and garish outfits .
cologne the bastion of broad-mindedness " cologne celebrates diversity – let ’ s make europe a place for all of us " – this year ’ s motto of the europride speaks volumes for the rhine metropolis ’ reputation for liberalism and tolerance and its stature as germany ’ s gay capital .
slogans such as " live and let live " and " everybody ’ s an individual " are familiar local sayings in cologne , where the rainbow-coloured flag – the trademark of homosexuality- flutters from roof tops and balconies all over the city year-round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the extreme permissiveness of the heart of the rhineland , it ’ s little wonder that the european pride organisers association selected cologne for the mega-event .
" we are proud that the europride is taking place in cologne for the first time " , says chief organiser michael schmidt .
until now the europride has only been held in capital cities , with the first being held in london in 1992 .
schmidt says that there ’ s hardly another city in germany where gays and lesbians can be as self-confident and open .
cologne holds a special place in the gay-lesbian scene in germany as well as internationally .
almost every tenth person in the cathedral city is said to be homosexual .
two months of partying since 1998 , christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- organisers from the baltic sea to lake constance , have joined forces to cooperate on staging the event .
this not only has made the organization more attractive to the sponsors , but also done away with important party dates clashing in different parts of germany .
as a result , csd fans can travel through germany for two months and indulge in the most excessive kind of party-hopping . # b # this year some 2 million csd tourists from all over the world are expected to descend upon cologne , bringing with them some 300 million euro .
the city ’ s restaurants and bars have already begun hiking beer prices .
over 200 events including exhibitions , readings , concerts , shows and even a " gay family day " will form part of this year ’ s europride .
acceptance of homosexuality – still a long way to go but the europride is not just about fun and celebrations .
this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .
their goal is equal rights for all and equal treatments for all ways of life .

this year ’ s motto - " let 's make europe a place for all of us " - is also a sober reminder that despite progress like germany 's recent law allowing homosexual civil marriages , not all of europe is as open-minded to gays taking to the streets as cologne .
just a few years ago , at the first csd in belgrade gay and lesbian demonstrators were beaten up by right-wing radicals right before the eyes of passive police .
fighting violence and discrimination against homosexuals , bisexuals and transsexuals is an ongoing political issue and one that gays have been involved with for more than 30 years , ever since the drag queen-led rebellion against violent police attacks and state power at the gay stonewall inn on christopher street in new york on june 27 , 1969 .
stonewall gives gay community a common voice even before that eventful day , between 1965 and 1969 activists from throughout the united states regularly gathered outside independence hall , where the us constitution was drafted and signed , to remind the nation that not all of its citizens had equal rights under the law .
the stonewall riots became a rallying point for a national movement as thousands of people turned out for the first anniversary of the riots in new york .
over time the gay pride festivities commemorating the anniversary of stonewall spilled over into other parts of the world and today they draw millions .
but the political message has stayed unchanged over the years .
this year too organisers of the europride in cologne say that tolerance is not the same as acceptance .
their goal is equal rights for all and equal treatments for all ways of life .
that 's what makes the europride and the csd essentially political events albeit ones where the participants sport feather boas , leather trousers and fake lashes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european pride organisers association official website of the europride 2002 in cologne 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

levels have climbed from around 13 percent in 1998 to 17 percent of the population in 2001 , according to government statistics .
young people , in particular , are difficult to motivate into employment with many still living off of generous communist-era welfare checks .
state costs will only increase if the country ’ s two million family farms go under because of an inability to transform themselves into the mechanized , mono-crop farms favored by eu member states .
the fact could widen an already significant divide between poland 's well-off city-dwellers and their poverty-stricken countrymen out on the land .
second-class citizens polish laborers were dealt another blow when brussels – in a nod to austria and germany – ruled recently they would have to wait seven years before being allowed to work in eu countries .
that , of course , hasn ’ t stopped polish workers from working illegally in places like germany and austria , who desperately need them for low-level jobs in construction , farm and factory work .
but the ban adds to the opinion among many in the population that poland , if it makes it , comes into the union as a second-class citizen .
the sentiment is a major reason support for eu membership has been waning since poland first applied in 1994 .
government change = new hope ?
still government officials are optimistic – if for no other reason than that there is no other choice . # b # observers note that if new polish prime minister leszek miller -lrb- photo -rrb- doesn ’ t get poland into the union a re-election is pretty much out of the question .
miller , a member of the successor to the former communist party , already faces domestic pressure to lead the country out of the economic swamp poland ’ s previous conservative government mired it in .
there is hope .
miller unlike his predecessor jerzy buzek , has a strong coalition and enjoys a majority in the government .
this has already attracted the attention of investors , who after pumping a record € 14.5 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- into the government in 2000 , have shied away in the past two years .
prime minister miller ’ s appointment of marek belka , an american-trained economist , as his finance minister has also helped matters .
the clock is ticking with more urgency .
the eu wants to wrap up negotiations with candidate countries by the end of this year .
at least 10 of the 29 legislative chapters needed to be completed for poland ’ s eu entry remain open .
the admission of poland into the union , so often history ’ s victim , is something both sides want .
but poland will have to move quickly if it wants to join the club . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de recognition for the polish farmer poland ’ s jadwiga lopata won the environmental community ’ s most prominent prize this week .

levels have climbed from around 13 percent in 1998 to 17 percent of the population in 2001 , according to government statistics .
young people , in particular , are difficult to motivate into employment with many still living off of generous communist-era welfare checks .
state costs will only increase if the country ’ s two million family farms go under because of an inability to transform themselves into the mechanized , mono-crop farms favored by eu member states .
the fact could widen an already significant divide between poland 's well-off city-dwellers and their poverty-stricken countrymen out on the land .
second-class citizens polish laborers were dealt another blow when brussels – in a nod to austria and germany – ruled recently they would have to wait seven years before being allowed to work in eu countries .
that , of course , hasn ’ t stopped polish workers from working illegally in places like germany and austria , who desperately need them for low-level jobs in construction , farm and factory work .
but the ban adds to the opinion among many in the population that poland , if it makes it , comes into the union as a second-class citizen .
the sentiment is a major reason support for eu membership has been waning since poland first applied in 1994 .
government change = new hope ?
still government officials are optimistic – if for no other reason than that there is no other choice . # b # observers note that if new polish prime minister leszek miller -lrb- photo -rrb- doesn ’ t get poland into the union a re-election is pretty much out of the question .
miller , a member of the successor to the former communist party , already faces domestic pressure to lead the country out of the economic swamp poland ’ s previous conservative government mired it in .
there is hope .
miller unlike his predecessor jerzy buzek , has a strong coalition and enjoys a majority in the government .

twelve central- and eastern european countries plan to join the eu .
poland is the largest of them and remains the furthest behind in negotiating entry . a few years ago , poland was the economic darling of eastern europe .
it had dodged the recession and currency problems of other former communist nations like hungary and began posting growth percentages that wowed investors .
they reacted by pumping billions into the economy .
unemployment levels were steady , direct investment was high and typically pessimistic poles were awash in optimism as they began negotiating for eu entry in 1998 .
how quickly things change .
growth has slumped , unemployment has soared to 17 percent of the population and the people are starting to express their doubts about eu entry .
all this with the deadline for 2004 entry almost upon them .
poland is the largest and most unwieldy of the 13 countries negotiating for entry into the until-now exclusive western european club .
polish and eu negotiators have clashed repeatedly on a number of conditions for eu entry – laid out in a 80,000 page document .
the farmer ’ s plight the european union is getting impatient with poland ’ s bulldog stance on several key issues , chief among them agriculture and unemployment .

parliament 's speaker marek borowski is in the background .
miller pledged to overcome the crisis of the public finances and to set the country on a path of high economic growth .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- the farmers are worried they will become an extinct species when poland gets flooded by agricultural products from highly industrialized eu farms .
the eu , fed up with the 20 percent share agriculture has in the polish labor market , has done nothing to assuage their fears .
product quotas assigned to all eu members promise to be far lower than those of the western states , meaning polish farmers will have a limit to how much they can sell .
they can ’ t depend on the rich subsidies enjoyed by current members either .
the eu has said that candidate countries will receive only 25 percent of the subsidies out of the € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- union agriculture budget that current countries enjoy .
what ’ s more , " polish farmers are not ready to apply and fulfill all the bureaucratic requirements needed to get the subsidies , " chris wietrzny , a farm lobbyist , told dw-world .
" there are only a small amount of farms who can benefit from the subsidies , around 25 percent .
for the rest of the farmers , a difficult period will start , because they will not be able to compete on the external market .

twelve central- and eastern european countries plan to join the eu .
poland is the largest of them and remains the furthest behind in negotiating entry . a few years ago , poland was the economic darling of eastern europe .
it had dodged the recession and currency problems of other former communist nations like hungary and began posting growth percentages that wowed investors .
they reacted by pumping billions into the economy .
unemployment levels were steady , direct investment was high and typically pessimistic poles were awash in optimism as they began negotiating for eu entry in 1998 .
how quickly things change .
growth has slumped , unemployment has soared to 17 percent of the population and the people are starting to express their doubts about eu entry .
all this with the deadline for 2004 entry almost upon them .
poland is the largest and most unwieldy of the 13 countries negotiating for entry into the until-now exclusive western european club .
polish and eu negotiators have clashed repeatedly on a number of conditions for eu entry – laid out in a 80,000 page document .
the farmer ’ s plight the european union is getting impatient with poland ’ s bulldog stance on several key issues , chief among them agriculture and unemployment .

levels have climbed from around 13 percent in 1998 to 17 percent of the population in 2001 , according to government statistics .
young people , in particular , are difficult to motivate into employment with many still living off of generous communist-era welfare checks .
state costs will only increase if the country ’ s two million family farms go under because of an inability to transform themselves into the mechanized , mono-crop farms favored by eu member states .
the fact could widen an already significant divide between poland 's well-off city-dwellers and their poverty-stricken countrymen out on the land .
second-class citizens polish laborers were dealt another blow when brussels – in a nod to austria and germany – ruled recently they would have to wait seven years before being allowed to work in eu countries .
that , of course , hasn ’ t stopped polish workers from working illegally in places like germany and austria , who desperately need them for low-level jobs in construction , farm and factory work .
but the ban adds to the opinion among many in the population that poland , if it makes it , comes into the union as a second-class citizen .
the sentiment is a major reason support for eu membership has been waning since poland first applied in 1994 .
government change = new hope ?
still government officials are optimistic – if for no other reason than that there is no other choice . # b # observers note that if new polish prime minister leszek miller -lrb- photo -rrb- doesn ’ t get poland into the union a re-election is pretty much out of the question .
miller , a member of the successor to the former communist party , already faces domestic pressure to lead the country out of the economic swamp poland ’ s previous conservative government mired it in .
there is hope .
miller unlike his predecessor jerzy buzek , has a strong coalition and enjoys a majority in the government .
this has already attracted the attention of investors , who after pumping a record € 14.5 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- into the government in 2000 , have shied away in the past two years .
prime minister miller ’ s appointment of marek belka , an american-trained economist , as his finance minister has also helped matters .
the clock is ticking with more urgency .
the eu wants to wrap up negotiations with candidate countries by the end of this year .
at least 10 of the 29 legislative chapters needed to be completed for poland ’ s eu entry remain open .
the admission of poland into the union , so often history ’ s victim , is something both sides want .
but poland will have to move quickly if it wants to join the club . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de recognition for the polish farmer poland ’ s jadwiga lopata won the environmental community ’ s most prominent prize this week .

the drive began as company officials said the number of offences being carried out had risen to " worrying " levels .
the initative against railway crime , the new name for trespass and vandalism , focuses on offences near and on the line itself .
the cost of railway crime to the rail industry in the uk is estimated at £ 250m a year , causing more than 1,000 hours delay to scottish passengers in the last year .
janette anderson said vandalism could be catastrophic railway crime week , which marks the start of what has been called the most aggressive campaign yet seen against criminals who attack the network , will run for seven days .
a railtrack scotland spokesman said his organisation would be running railway crime awareness events across the country .
it would also teach primary schoolchildren about the dangers on railways and raise awareness of the dangers of level crossing misuse and the importance of crossing safely .
janette anderson , a director of the track company , added : " we can not stress enough that railway crime could result in a catastrophic accident .
" acts of vandalism cause the biggest single risk to the safety of the rail network , and the rise in the number of offences on the scottish network is worrying . "
' threatening lives ' ms anderson urged local communities , teachers and youth workers to join the campaign in the run up to the school holidays .
she said : " people need to seriously consider their actions before potentially threatening their life and the lives of others . "
about 50 % of all damage to trains on the uk network is inflicted by vandals throwing things at trains or leaving obstructions on the track .
during the last year , there has been a 20 % increase in the number of incidents of trespass and vandalism .
more than 70,000 yards of lineside fencing was upgraded by railtrack in scotland last year at a cost of £ 1.5m.

up to 16.8 million people tuned in on saturday to watch - making it the most watched game of the world cup so far , the bbc said .
the corporation said bbc one 's live coverage of the match attracted an average of 12.4 million viewers - 70 % of people watching television .
only an average of 3.2m , or 18 % , switched over to watch the game on itv1 .
peaks this makes it the biggest audience for the bbc on a saturday lunchtime since the funeral of diana , princess of wales .
the football league had called on england fans to boycott itv 's screening of the match , in order to put pressure on the network 's leading companies , carlton and granada , to enter into discussions over the collapse of itv digital .
during the match , viewing figures peaked to 13.2m on bbc one and 3.6m on itv1 , the bbc said .
the number of people watching a football match usually peaks during the second half , when more people tune in to find out the score , said a bbc spokeswoman .

ed fagan , who played a key role in securing compensation for holocaust survivors from swiss banks , told the french news agency afp he would begin proceedings at a new york court on monday .
he declined to specify the amount being sought , but swiss newspaper sonntagszeitung said ubs and credit suisse face demands for 80bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 51.3bn ; 60bn euros -rrb- .
the banks are accused of profiting from loans to the white south african government while a united nations embargo was in force .
the banks say they have no knowledge of a lawsuit , but a credit suisse spokeswoman said that to blame them for the injustices of apartheid would be preposterous and unsubstantiated by the facts .
complicated case the case will be coordinated by south african human rights lawyer dumisa ntsebeza .
" the regime would never have survived so long if it had not gone on being supported ... by firms whose only goal was profit , " sonntagszeitung quoted mr ntsebeza as saying .
the case is being pursued in the american courts under laws permitting non-us citizens to file human rights claims against companies doing business in the united states .
but the suit is likely to be complicated by jurisdictional issues .
switzerland did not take part in a united nations-led round of trade sanctions against south africa , although it did observe an arms embargo .
in 1998 , a group of swiss banks agreed to pay $ 1.25bn to settle legal action arising from the alleged hoarding of holocaust victims ' bank accounts after world war ii .

" the regime would never have survived so long if it had not gone on being supported ... by firms whose only goal was profit , " sonntagszeitung quoted mr ntsebeza as saying .
the case is being pursued in the american courts under laws permitting non-us citizens to file human rights claims against companies doing business in the united states .
but the suit is likely to be complicated by jurisdictional issues .
switzerland did not take part in a united nations-led round of trade sanctions against south africa , although it did observe an arms embargo .
in 1998 , a group of swiss banks agreed to pay $ 1.25bn to settle legal action arising from the alleged hoarding of holocaust victims ' bank accounts after world war ii .

forestry technician terry barton , 38 , faces charges of setting fire to timber in a national forest , damaging government property , and making false statements to investigators .
ms barton changed her original story - that she found an illegal camp fire - saying a fire that she had started herself to burn a personal letter had got out of control .
she is scheduled to make an initial court appearance in a denver federal court on monday .
" this is one of the hardest announcements i 've had to make in my career , " said forest service official rick cables as he told a news conference of her arrest .
the forest fires , which have consumed some 40,000 hectares -lrb- 100,000 acres -rrb- and forced several thousand people from their homes , have been described as the worst in the state 's history .
ms barton admitted starting a blaze while patrolling the hayman area of pike national forest to enforce a fire ban , us federal prosecutor bill leone said .
she said she had decided to burn a letter from her estranged husband which had upset her .
she set fire to it in an authorised camp fire site and then left believing she had extinguished the fire , she said .
but driving past the site after turning round her vehicle she found that the fire had spread beyond the camp fire ring .
she tried but was unable to suppress the fire .
if convicted , ms barton could be sentenced up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $ 250,000 .

with higher humidity and calmer winds , officials are hoping the flames will not spread too much further .
but the fires may not be fully extinguished until september , and long-term weather forecasts also indicate further hot weather .
last week , a state of emergency was declared by the colorado governor - an action which enables the state to activate the national guard and call on federal resources if needed .

costing more than $ 11m -lrb- £ 7.4m -rrb- , this is the third celluloid take on sarat chandra chatterjee 's classic 1913 novel .
" devdas has tirelessly lingered at the back of my mind , " director sanjay leela bhansali said .
" i thought it would be a fascinating challenge for me as a director to present already known and loved characters , in my very own way , with my perspective . "
bhansali 's film is a modern-day interpretation of the poignant love story of devdas - played by actor shahrukh khan , who drunkenly pines after his childhood sweetheart while rebuffing the advances of a love-struck courtesan .
the film ends with his tragic death at the doorstep of his beloved .
lavish devdas recreates calcutta of the early 20th century .
most of the film has been shot on lavishly built sets in mumbai 's film city - including a stained-glass house which took over seven months to be erected , a gold staircase leading to a gold-pillared courtesan 's chamber and a house with 180 pillars .
" i felt this had to be made with an opulence and grandeur that would do justice to its beautiful subject and characters , " says bhansali .
" if chandramukhi , the gold-hearted prostitute came down the steps , the steps had to be worth it " each costume speaks of the painstaking research and flawless workmanship , promising to be a visual delight for today 's film-goers and a prized possession for posterity .
an outfit designed by india 's leading designers , abu jani and sandeep khosla , is the most talked about - not just as an exquisite creation , but also for weighing over 16 kgs .
wearing that costume , actress madhuri dixit has performed some of the most intricate dance steps in the film .
challenge devdas is the most challenging project bhansali and his actors have ever ventured .
before shahrukh khan , the role of devdas has been immortalised by screen legends dilip kumar and k l saigal .
tough comparisons are inevitable , especially with the filmmaker giving a contemporary feel to the classic love tragedy .
" i feel that the director should get the liberty of interpreting the novel the way he wants to , " bhansali said .
' ' the story has a perpetual appeal .
even the current generation would cry with devdas at his tragedy .
i 'm pretty sure my film will be a box office success despite a lot of reinterpretation . "
hope bollywood too has pinned its hope on devdas to break the current trend of films even failing to gain moderate success at the box office .
" there seems to be a lot of interest in the film which is positive indication " says film trade analyst taran adarsh .
devdas was highly acclaimed at its première at cannes , making it one of the most awaited films this summer .
apart from the audiences , the film 's release is being eagerly awaited by universal music , which paid nearly $ 3m -lrb- £ 2m -rrb- for the music rights to devdas .
" the curiosity in the market for devdas is unbelievable , " says universal music 's vinay sapru , adding that ' ' we are expecting to break many records with the album " .
whether this curiosity and hype will translates into box-office success will be known when it is released on 12 july .

driver peter duncalfe halted his train just yards from where a car had fallen 30 feet from a road on to a railway line in dorset .
the 63-year-old driver of the car , from leamington spa in warwickshire , was killed in the accident and police think his companion , a woman , could have been trapped in the blue peugeot 309 for up to eight hours .
she was treated after being taken to hospital in an air ambulance .
mr duncalfe said his first thought was that joy riders may have pushed the car on to the track .
the skill of the air ambulance helicopter pilot who took the injured woman to hospital was incredible and unbelievable peter duncalfe , train driver he said : " as a train driver you are always looking ahead along the line for something unusual and out of the ordinary . "
when he saw the wreckage of the car he stopped the train 300 yards short of the bridge .
he said the locomotive fireman and the guard went to see if they could help anyone in the car , as he dialled 999 on his mobile phone .
mr duncalfe praised the speed and skill of the emergency services .
" the paramedic car was on the scene within three to four minutes and the fire brigade from swanage was there almost instantly after that , " he said .
the woman passenger was airlifted to hospital .
" the skill of the air ambulance helicopter pilot who took the injured woman to hospital was incredible and unbelievable , " he said .
" it was awesome .
firemen used hydraulic cutting equipment on the car " first , the helicopter landed on the rails while a member of the crew got out and then the pilot took off and landed on a small level area of grass between the rail and where the railway embankment side starts to drop .
it was amazing , " mr duncalfe said .
after the accident the operators of swanage railway repeated their calls for crash barriers to be put on the road after a motorcyclist left the carriageway at the same spot three years ago .
the chairman of the railway , bill trite , said : " it is somewhat shutting the stable door after the proverbial horse has bolted .
" if we had not been running trains i do not know how long it would have been before that unfortunate couple were found .
" the car had got itself under the bridge in such a position that dozens and dozens of motorists had passed by during the morning and did not see it . "

driver peter duncalfe halted his train just yards from where a car had fallen 30 feet from a road on to a railway line in dorset .
the 63-year-old driver of the car , from leamington spa in warwickshire , was killed in the accident and police think his companion , a woman , could have been trapped in the blue peugeot 309 for up to eight hours .
she was treated after being taken to hospital in an air ambulance .
mr duncalfe said his first thought was that joy riders may have pushed the car on to the track . "
the skill of the air ambulance helicopter pilot who took the injured woman to hospital was incredible and unbelievable " peter duncalfe , train driver he said : " as a train driver you are always looking ahead along the line for something unusual and out of the ordinary . "
when he saw the wreckage of the car he stopped the train 300 yards short of the bridge .
he said the locomotive fireman and the guard went to see if they could help anyone in the car , as he dialled 999 on his mobile phone .
mr duncalfe praised the speed and skill of the emergency services .
" the paramedic car was on the scene within three to four minutes and the fire brigade from swanage was there almost instantly after that , " he said .
the woman passenger was airlifted to hospital .
" the skill of the air ambulance helicopter pilot who took the injured woman to hospital was incredible and unbelievable , " he said .
" it was awesome .
" first , the helicopter landed on the rails while a member of the crew got out and then the pilot took off and landed on a small level area of grass between the rail and where the railway embankment side starts to drop .
it was amazing , " mr duncalfe said .
after the accident the operators of swanage railway repeated their calls for crash barriers to be put on the road after a motorcyclist left the carriageway at the same spot three years ago .
the chairman of the railway , bill trite , said : " it is somewhat shutting the stable door after the proverbial horse has bolted .
" if we had not been running trains i do not know how long it would have been before that unfortunate couple were found .
" the car had got itself under the bridge in such a position that dozens and dozens of motorists had passed by during the morning and did not see it . "

scientists at the australian national university -lrb- anu -rrb- made a beam of light disappear in one place and reappear in another a short distance away .
the achievement confirms that in theory teleportation is possible , at least for sub-atomic particles ; whether it can be done for larger systems , such as atoms , remains to be seen .
the more likely applications will come in telecommunications , enabling much faster transfer of data and the use of encryption that can never be broken .
will we ever be able to teleport humans ?
teleportation has been one of the hottest topics among physicists working in quantum mechanics - the study of the fundamental structure of matter .
some 40 labs around the world are currently trying to teleport a laser beam after pioneering work in 1998 at the california institute of technology showed it should be possible .
' spooky interaction ' the australian researchers have exploited a phenomenon called " quantum entanglement " , which links the properties of two photons of light created at the same time .
einstein called it a " spooky interaction " .
what it means is that two photons can be created and sent to different places .
it is possible to force one photon into a specific quantum mechanical state and , because the two photons are connected in some way , the other photon will instantaneously take up a complementary state .
at first sight , entanglement offers the prospect of sending a signal faster than the speed of light .
but a closer look at what is actually possible shows that this will not work because of the limits of what can be known about quantum mechanical systems and how such information is relayed .
but it may offer the prospect of a star trek-style transporter .
' exciting applications ' using quantum entanglement , anu physicist ping koy lam has disassembled laser light at one end of an optical communications system and recreated a replica just a metre away .
an encoded signal is embedded in an input stream of photons , which is entangled with another beam .
elsewhere in the lab , the beam of photons and the associated signal is reconstituted .
" what we have demonstrated here is that we can take billions of photons , destroy them simultaneously , and then recreate them in another place , " dr lam says .
" the applications of teleportation for computers and communications over the next decade are very exciting , " he adds .
body movement quantum teleportation could make encrypted or coded information 100 % secure , dr lam said , because even if intercepted the message would be unintelligible unless it was intended for a specific recipient .
" it should be possible to construct a perfect cryptography system .
when two parties want to communicate with one another , we can enable the secrecy of the communication to be absolutely perfect . "
but for a human to be teleported , a machine would have to be built that could pinpoint and analyse the trillions and trillions of atoms that make up the human body .
" i think teleporting of that kind is very , very far away , " dr lam says .
" we do n't know how to do that with a single atom yet . "

the star told an audience of 7,500 people at a concert in the city on sunday : " we can not play the music without thinking of why we are here tonight . "
sir elton is touring europe to promote his last album , songs from the west coast .
he is to donate the proceeds from ticket sales for the erfurt concert to a local fund helping care for people affected by the shooting .
on 26 april robert steinhauser , a 19-year-old who had been expelled from school the previous autumn , killed 13 teachers , two students and a police officer in a 20-minute shooting spree .
the rampage at erfurt 's johann gutenberg gymnasium ended when steinhauser turned the gun on himself .
sir elton said he was " moved and so upset " when he heard of the shooting .
he told the audience at erfurt : " we were thinking maybe we should n't come to erfurt to play because it would be in bad taste . "
' justice ' " this is our tribute to those people .
" we 're very proud to be here and we hope we can do justice by playing our very best , " he added to cheers .
his group played for two and a half hours at the concert .
the killings shocked germany , and led to moves to tighten the country 's gun laws .
last week the german parliament approved a bill to outlaw pump-action shotguns .
the minimum age for legal possession of a firearm for recreational use is also to be increased , from 18 to 21 .
