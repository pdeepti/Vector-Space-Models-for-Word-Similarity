program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2002 kirch media set to be pared down to the core großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite dishes of kirch media group 's tv channels handelsblatt has learned that administrators see a dramatically streamlined kirch media holding group emerging from its insolvency process . advisers have recommended that the company succeeding the insolvent kirch media holding group should essentially be pared down to its original core business of film rights trading plus its majority stake in listed television group pro sieben sat 1 media ag , handelsblatt has learned .
the advisers presented a restructuring proposal earlier in the week to the group 's two top executives , wolfgang van betteray and hans-joachim ziems , as well as provisional insolvency administrator michael jaffé .
the plan provides for the cession of 66 % of the group 's activities , measured in terms of their capacity for revenue generation , in film and television production .
only the most high-earning entertainment production units are to be retained , according to the plan , while the units that are to be disposed of include ndf neue deutsche , production firm plazamediafilmgesellschaft and sport channel dsf .
van betteray , ziems and jaffé are under time pressure to agree on a restructuring plan .
they have two weeks at the most before insolvency proceedings are set to be opened .
when this happens , a rescue company - or more than one rescue companies - will be set up to absorb the businesses that are seen to be worth keeping .
the remaining businesses will be sold off individually .
under one proposal that 's under consideration , a separate rescue company is to be set up purely for kirch media 's activities in sports rights trading , the area in which the group had been most expansive in its last months before insolvency .
consideration is being given to the idea of paring down the sports rights business to the profitable big events such as the soccer world cup or the olympic games .
investment bank ubs warburg has been charged with the task of finding a buyer for the rescue company or companies , and it has reportedly received 55 offers .
the parties that have expressed interest include big hollywood studios , financial investors and european media groups .
the selection process is set to get underway at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's film library -lrb- ap photo / ho / kirchmedia -rrb- one major obstacle to an agreement is likely to be the differences between kirch media 's own estimates of the value of founder leo kirch 's massive film rights library and potential buyers ' estimates of its worth .
in the last available kirch media balance sheet , the library 's value is recorded as around 3 billion euro .
" the value is likely to be cut massively , " according to people close to the negotiations .
according to reports , only one third to a half of the film rights have any real worth at all .
if the library fails to fetch a good price , it will come as a blow to kirch media 's creditor-banks , since the group used the library as collateral against its loans .
in a separate development on thursday , the regional court in munich ruled that the kirch group media conglomerate - of which kirch media is a part - can retain control of its 40 % stake in europe 's largest newspaper publishing house , axel springer verlag , until august 30 .
but if the media group fails to repay its loan of 720 million euro to deutsche bank by that date , it must not challenge the bank 's right to seize the stake .
at the start of this year , deutsche 's chief executive , rolf breuer , publicly cast doubt on kirch group 's creditworthiness .
kirch 's lawyers , peter gauweiler and wolf-rüdiger bub , argued that this statement had affected the group 's reputation , and thereby hastened its demise .
thursday 's ruling suggests that the court was not totally unreceptive to this line of argument .
the ruling means that deutsche will not , for now , be able to go ahead with plans to float the springer shares on the stock market after the summer recess .
on wednesday , it was revealed that the plan had received the blessing of three banks who hold the right of veto : bayerische landesbank -lrb- bayernlb -rrb- , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
kirch used the springer stake as collateral against deutsche 's loan but also against a loan of 1.6 billion euro issued by bayernlb , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
in this connection , it has become customary to refer to this group of three banks as the formula one banks , because the loan was used to buy kirch 's stake in the formula one racing tournament .
deutsche was granted first right to the springer shares , giving it the right to dispose of the shares if , as happened , kirch failed to service its debt .
but the formula one banks were granted second right , giving them the power to veto any plans deutsche puts forward for the shares .
furthermore , they also have the right to take in any funds raised over and and above the sum that deutsche is owed .
banking insiders were expecting an excess of around 50 million euro , since the share issue was expected to rake in almost 800 million euro - a sum that would almost certainly have made it germany 's largest public offering by far this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 06.06.02 © economy .

the plan provides for the cession of 66 % of the group 's activities , measured in terms of their capacity for revenue generation , in film and television production .
only the most high-earning entertainment production units are to be retained , according to the plan , while the units that are to be disposed of include ndf neue deutsche , production firm plazamediafilmgesellschaft and sport channel dsf .
van betteray , ziems and jaffé are under time pressure to agree on a restructuring plan .
they have two weeks at the most before insolvency proceedings are set to be opened .
when this happens , a rescue company - or more than one rescue companies - will be set up to absorb the businesses that are seen to be worth keeping .
the remaining businesses will be sold off individually .
under one proposal that 's under consideration , a separate rescue company is to be set up purely for kirch media 's activities in sports rights trading , the area in which the group had been most expansive in its last months before insolvency .
consideration is being given to the idea of paring down the sports rights business to the profitable big events such as the soccer world cup or the olympic games .
investment bank ubs warburg has been charged with the task of finding a buyer for the rescue company or companies , and it has reportedly received 55 offers .
the parties that have expressed interest include big hollywood studios , financial investors and european media groups .
the selection process is set to get underway at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's film library -lrb- ap photo / ho / kirchmedia -rrb- one major obstacle to an agreement is likely to be the differences between kirch media 's own estimates of the value of founder leo kirch 's massive film rights library and potential buyers ' estimates of its worth .
in the last available kirch media balance sheet , the library 's value is recorded as around 3 billion euro .
" the value is likely to be cut massively , " according to people close to the negotiations .
according to reports , only one third to a half of the film rights have any real worth at all .
if the library fails to fetch a good price , it will come as a blow to kirch media 's creditor-banks , since the group used the library as collateral against its loans .
in a separate development on thursday , the regional court in munich ruled that the kirch group media conglomerate - of which kirch media is a part - can retain control of its 40 % stake in europe 's largest newspaper publishing house , axel springer verlag , until august 30 .
but if the media group fails to repay its loan of 720 million euro to deutsche bank by that date , it must not challenge the bank 's right to seize the stake .
at the start of this year , deutsche 's chief executive , rolf breuer , publicly cast doubt on kirch group 's creditworthiness .
kirch 's lawyers , peter gauweiler and wolf-rüdiger bub , argued that this statement had affected the group 's reputation , and thereby hastened its demise .
thursday 's ruling suggests that the court was not totally unreceptive to this line of argument .
the ruling means that deutsche will not , for now , be able to go ahead with plans to float the springer shares on the stock market after the summer recess .
on wednesday , it was revealed that the plan had received the blessing of three banks who hold the right of veto : bayerische landesbank -lrb- bayernlb -rrb- , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
kirch used the springer stake as collateral against deutsche 's loan but also against a loan of 1.6 billion euro issued by bayernlb , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
in this connection , it has become customary to refer to this group of three banks as the formula one banks , because the loan was used to buy kirch 's stake in the formula one racing tournament .
deutsche was granted first right to the springer shares , giving it the right to dispose of the shares if , as happened , kirch failed to service its debt .
but the formula one banks were granted second right , giving them the power to veto any plans deutsche puts forward for the shares .
furthermore , they also have the right to take in any funds raised over and and above the sum that deutsche is owed .
banking insiders were expecting an excess of around 50 million euro , since the share issue was expected to rake in almost 800 million euro - a sum that would almost certainly have made it germany 's largest public offering by far this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 06.06.02 © economy .

the spiral , according to 41-year-old entrepreneur angelika huber , is an ancient symbol of femininity .
and yet she has chosen it as the logo for a brand new project – a bank for women . there are good reasons for opening a bank just for women , according to angelika huber .
" women think differently .
women approach technology differently .
and women have a different relationship to money , " she says .
" conventional banks do n't always support the way women do business . "
huber herself is rich in business credentials .
in 1990 she founded a women 's computer school in munich .
three years ago , the school became a joint stock company and has generated over euro 1 million in income .
huber also manages a publishing house and works as a consultant .
huber and her business partner astrid hastreiter started collecting the capital needed to establish a bank in germany - € 5m .
the two women sent tens of thousands of emails seeking investment in the project .
through market analyses huber and hastreiter found they had developed a sound concept , but the women 's bank has had to be put on the backburner while they collect more funds , resolve legal problems expand their skeleton team .
and they 're off huber describes herself as someone who is more inclined to shift an appointment forward , rather than postpone it .
she has no intention of letting the project lose momentum .
this friday , the bank came one step closer to becoming a reality .
in munich , huber and hastreiter launched the women 's investment management company , where the funds will be held in trust for the bank .
" today the project moved from a political stage to an economic one , " huber said .
in a year 's time , she hopes the bank will be operating .
by 2004 , it will offer full banking services to women , including personal savings accounts .
why a women 's bank ?
a decade ago , the german consumers ' organization ' stiftung warentest ' discovered that banks were providing male customers with better service than women , because they had less trust in women 's competence in financial matters .
in the ten years since , banks have recognized that women represent a special market , and they now offer services and advice to attract female customers .
in recent years , finance seminars for women have become common , and some banks even advertise better rates for women .
but that 's not enough , say huber and hastreiter .
it 's still much harder for women to get loans .
one of the goals of the women 's bank is to offer small loans of up to 15,000 for company start-ups or university studies .
the grameen bank in bangladesh and sewa in india have been operating in this way since the 1970s , providing microcredit to assist women in getting small projects off the ground .
the idea of a women-friendly bank is not new to germany .
a women 's bank existed in berlin in 1910 .
the first world war caused its collapse .
another bank with political objectives , the ecobank , met the same fate in june last year .
after a number of loans failed , it became insolvent and its 22,000 customers lost more than euro 2.7m.
we 'll do it our way huber was herself a member of the ecobank co-operative and lost money when it went bankrupt .
but that has n't deterred her .
the women 's bank , she says , wo n't make the same mistakes .
but it will invest in environmental funds .
profits from the bank will be invested in environmental and social projects .
huber says women are much more interested than men in investing ethically .
they own nearly eighty percent of all environmental investments .
huber says what will distinguish the women 's bank from ' ordinary ' banks is that it will cater to the needs of a particular group , rather than simply selling products .
huber and hastreiter are keen to stress that their bank is not a social service or a charity .
it will be managed by a small team , so as to keep costs down .
the offices will be based in munich , but services will only be offered online .
huber says the women 's bank is intended to be woman-friendly , not hostile to men .

the spiral , according to 41-year-old entrepreneur angelika huber , is an ancient symbol of femininity .
and yet she has chosen it as the logo for a brand new project – a bank for women . there are good reasons for opening a bank just for women , according to angelika huber .
" women think differently .
women approach technology differently .
and women have a different relationship to money , " she says .
" conventional banks do n't always support the way women do business . "
huber herself is rich in business credentials .
in 1990 she founded a women 's computer school in munich .
three years ago , the school became a joint stock company and has generated over euro 1 million in income .
huber also manages a publishing house and works as a consultant .
huber and her business partner astrid hastreiter started collecting the capital needed to establish a bank in germany - € 5m .
the two women sent tens of thousands of emails seeking investment in the project .
through market analyses huber and hastreiter found they had developed a sound concept , but the women 's bank has had to be put on the backburner while they collect more funds , resolve legal problems expand their skeleton team .
and they 're off huber describes herself as someone who is more inclined to shift an appointment forward , rather than postpone it .
she has no intention of letting the project lose momentum .
this friday , the bank came one step closer to becoming a reality .
in munich , huber and hastreiter launched the women 's investment management company , where the funds will be held in trust for the bank .
" today the project moved from a political stage to an economic one , " huber said .
in a year 's time , she hopes the bank will be operating .
by 2004 , it will offer full banking services to women , including personal savings accounts .
why a women 's bank ?
a decade ago , the german consumers ' organization ' stiftung warentest ' discovered that banks were providing male customers with better service than women , because they had less trust in women 's competence in financial matters .
in the ten years since , banks have recognized that women represent a special market , and they now offer services and advice to attract female customers .
in recent years , finance seminars for women have become common , and some banks even advertise better rates for women .
but that 's not enough , say huber and hastreiter .
it 's still much harder for women to get loans .
one of the goals of the women 's bank is to offer small loans of up to 15,000 for company start-ups or university studies .
the grameen bank in bangladesh and sewa in india have been operating in this way since the 1970s , providing microcredit to assist women in getting small projects off the ground .
the idea of a women-friendly bank is not new to germany .
a women 's bank existed in berlin in 1910 .
the first world war caused its collapse .
another bank with political objectives , the ecobank , met the same fate in june last year .
after a number of loans failed , it became insolvent and its 22,000 customers lost more than euro 2.7m.
we 'll do it our way huber was herself a member of the ecobank co-operative and lost money when it went bankrupt .
but that has n't deterred her .
the women 's bank , she says , wo n't make the same mistakes .
but it will invest in environmental funds .
profits from the bank will be invested in environmental and social projects .
huber says women are much more interested than men in investing ethically .
they own nearly eighty percent of all environmental investments .
huber says what will distinguish the women 's bank from ' ordinary ' banks is that it will cater to the needs of a particular group , rather than simply selling products .
huber and hastreiter are keen to stress that their bank is not a social service or a charity .
it will be managed by a small team , so as to keep costs down .
the offices will be based in munich , but services will only be offered online .
huber says the women 's bank is intended to be woman-friendly , not hostile to men .
and yes , men will be able to use its services , if they 're willing to take the risk ! send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the women 's bank the home page of the women 's bank -lrb- in german -rrb- german banks online general information from the association of german banks -lrb- in english -rrb- radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2002 kirch media set to be pared down to the core großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite dishes of kirch media group 's tv channels handelsblatt has learned that administrators see a dramatically streamlined kirch media holding group emerging from its insolvency process . advisers have recommended that the company succeeding the insolvent kirch media holding group should essentially be pared down to its original core business of film rights trading plus its majority stake in listed television group pro sieben sat 1 media ag , handelsblatt has learned .
the advisers presented a restructuring proposal earlier in the week to the group 's two top executives , wolfgang van betteray and hans-joachim ziems , as well as provisional insolvency administrator michael jaffé .
the plan provides for the cession of 66 % of the group 's activities , measured in terms of their capacity for revenue generation , in film and television production .
only the most high-earning entertainment production units are to be retained , according to the plan , while the units that are to be disposed of include ndf neue deutsche , production firm plazamediafilmgesellschaft and sport channel dsf .
van betteray , ziems and jaffé are under time pressure to agree on a restructuring plan .
they have two weeks at the most before insolvency proceedings are set to be opened .
when this happens , a rescue company - or more than one rescue companies - will be set up to absorb the businesses that are seen to be worth keeping .
the remaining businesses will be sold off individually .
under one proposal that 's under consideration , a separate rescue company is to be set up purely for kirch media 's activities in sports rights trading , the area in which the group had been most expansive in its last months before insolvency .
consideration is being given to the idea of paring down the sports rights business to the profitable big events such as the soccer world cup or the olympic games .
investment bank ubs warburg has been charged with the task of finding a buyer for the rescue company or companies , and it has reportedly received 55 offers .
the parties that have expressed interest include big hollywood studios , financial investors and european media groups .
the selection process is set to get underway at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's film library -lrb- ap photo / ho / kirchmedia -rrb- one major obstacle to an agreement is likely to be the differences between kirch media 's own estimates of the value of founder leo kirch 's massive film rights library and potential buyers ' estimates of its worth .
in the last available kirch media balance sheet , the library 's value is recorded as around 3 billion euro .
" the value is likely to be cut massively , " according to people close to the negotiations .
according to reports , only one third to a half of the film rights have any real worth at all .
if the library fails to fetch a good price , it will come as a blow to kirch media 's creditor-banks , since the group used the library as collateral against its loans .
in a separate development on thursday , the regional court in munich ruled that the kirch group media conglomerate - of which kirch media is a part - can retain control of its 40 % stake in europe 's largest newspaper publishing house , axel springer verlag , until august 30 .
but if the media group fails to repay its loan of 720 million euro to deutsche bank by that date , it must not challenge the bank 's right to seize the stake .
at the start of this year , deutsche 's chief executive , rolf breuer , publicly cast doubt on kirch group 's creditworthiness .
kirch 's lawyers , peter gauweiler and wolf-rüdiger bub , argued that this statement had affected the group 's reputation , and thereby hastened its demise .
thursday 's ruling suggests that the court was not totally unreceptive to this line of argument .
the ruling means that deutsche will not , for now , be able to go ahead with plans to float the springer shares on the stock market after the summer recess .
on wednesday , it was revealed that the plan had received the blessing of three banks who hold the right of veto : bayerische landesbank -lrb- bayernlb -rrb- , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
kirch used the springer stake as collateral against deutsche 's loan but also against a loan of 1.6 billion euro issued by bayernlb , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
in this connection , it has become customary to refer to this group of three banks as the formula one banks , because the loan was used to buy kirch 's stake in the formula one racing tournament .
deutsche was granted first right to the springer shares , giving it the right to dispose of the shares if , as happened , kirch failed to service its debt .
but the formula one banks were granted second right , giving them the power to veto any plans deutsche puts forward for the shares .
furthermore , they also have the right to take in any funds raised over and and above the sum that deutsche is owed .
banking insiders were expecting an excess of around 50 million euro , since the share issue was expected to rake in almost 800 million euro - a sum that would almost certainly have made it germany 's largest public offering by far this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 06.06.02 © economy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david beckham the most attractive clash in the first phase kicked off in sapporo , japan with pressure on both sides .
it was a game neither side could afford to lose .
destiny pitted historic rivals against each other ever since destiny brought out the two team names together from the world cup hat , the media and fans alike have been reliving everything from the falklands war of 1982 to the ‘ hand of god ’ incident in mexico ’ 86 .
although both aspects had been talked up beyond hype , the result would be far greater than the sum of its parts .
with argentina , the almost obsessive desire to put english football in its place might have inspired the players more than their need to win .
after beating nigeria in their first game , the much fancied argentines were plotting a good course to the second round .
england , who had disappointed more than their own nation with a stale and uninventive draw with sweden , also had pride on their list of targets but the all important three points remained the only option if they hoped to progress further .
errors and injuries built up nailbiting tension the game began in a flourish of scrappy , hurried passes and tackles .
the pace in the opening exchanges was to set the tempo for the whole match as both teams rose to the challenge .
the frantic opening saw first zanetti and then killy gonzalez test england keeper david seaman but the experienced arsenal goalie was positioned well to deal with both attacks .
the desire to press forward for both teams led to an early rash of mistimed tackles and late challenges that increased the temperature on the pitch .
england responded well with fair commitment while frustration crept into the argentine game .
this resulted in a 12 minute booking for striker gabriel batistuta .
england , having floundered without any left sided stability in their first match , once again showed their weakness by filling the job no-one wants with paul scholes , a more natural and accomplished centre player .
with nicky butt and owen hargreaves holding the middle , england eventually settled only to be disrupted by hargreaves limping off in the 18th minute .
the clincher his replacement , trevor sinclair , added width to the midfield , dropping into the wide left role and allowing scholes to return to the centre .
sinclair made his first contribution a telling one when he combined well in the build up that saw michael owen hit the post squarely after 23 minutes .
argentina were forced back as england surged forward in a reverse of their negative play against sweden .
the physical battle was still very much still up for grabs as clashes across the pitch led to a number of verbal warnings and free kicks .
england ’ s ashley cole picked up a yellow card on the half hour .
sinclair was causing more problems on the left and after the england defence had recovered from a gonzalez volley that flashed over the bar , the west ham player fed the ball into michael owen in the argentine box .
owen twisted and showed a clean pair of heels to mauricio pochettino before being brought down by the defender .
beckham picked up the ball and showed a captain ’ s composure to rifle the penalty in low past the static burgos .
england led 1-0 with two minutes left to play in the second half . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

just two decades earlier , nazi officials had purged german museums of art they considered " degenerate , " including works by marc chagall , max ernst , käthe kollwitz , paul klee and wassily kandinsky .
many of these same artists – ernst , klee and kandinsky among them – were represented at the first documenta as bode worked to make good on the decades of destruction .
nearly half a century later , documenta 11 is set to open june 8 in kassel .
the art fair is staged every five years and is a major date in the european art calendar , rivalling venice 's biennale .
this time there will be five exhibition venues in town and works by more than 100 artists from around the world will be on display .
for the first time , documenta will use an industrial building – a former brewery – for the show , essentially doubling the exhibition space and making it one of europe ’ s largest art shows .
international platforms indeed this year 's artistic director of documenta 11 , nigerian-born okwui enwezor -lrb- photo -rrb- , set out to make it into an international event by staging a series of so-called platforms on different continents in the year leading up to the kassel show .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intention of these platfroms , according to statement from documenta officials , was " to bring the important artistic field to which documenta 11 belongs in dialogue with other fields and cities . "
the platforms were grouped according to theme : " democracy unrealized " in vienna and berlin ; " experiments with truth : transitional justice and the processes of truth and reconciliation " in new delhi ; " créolité and creolization " in st. lucia , and " under siege : four african cities " in freetown , johannesburg , kinshasa and lagos .
art in a social context in kassel , meanwhile , the show will include a broad spectrum of artists who are dealing with social problems in different parts of the world .
" where an artist comes from should not come into question , " said enwezor , a poet , critic and curator who is the publisher and founding editor of " nka : journal of contemporary african art , " which is co-published with the african studies center at cornell university .
chilean artist alfredo jaar , whose work deals with the situation on the border between the united states and mexico , is one of the artists included in the show .
new yorker lorna simpson , who deals with race discrimination , and belgian artist luc tuymans , who addresses issues of the colonial history of the congo , are also included .
multimedia performance on june 8 and june 9 , the theater-performance " confessions of zeno " by participating artist william kentridge will take place at the staatstheater kassel .
based on italo svevo ’ s novel la coscienza di zeno , the multimedia theater production uses puppetry , song , acting , music and video to explore experiences of labor and erotic pleasures of the european bourgeoisie prior to world war i. documenta 10 , held in 1997 , attracted a record 631,000 visitors and exhibition organizers are already warning about traffic jams and sold-out hotels during the first weeks of the show .

just two decades earlier , nazi officials had purged german museums of art they considered " degenerate , " including works by marc chagall , max ernst , käthe kollwitz , paul klee and wassily kandinsky .
many of these same artists – ernst , klee and kandinsky among them – were represented at the first documenta as bode worked to make good on the decades of destruction .
nearly half a century later , documenta 11 is set to open june 8 in kassel .
the art fair is staged every five years and is a major date in the european art calendar , rivalling venice 's biennale .
this time there will be five exhibition venues in town and works by more than 100 artists from around the world will be on display .
for the first time , documenta will use an industrial building – a former brewery – for the show , essentially doubling the exhibition space and making it one of europe ’ s largest art shows .
international platforms indeed this year 's artistic director of documenta 11 , nigerian-born okwui enwezor -lrb- photo -rrb- , set out to make it into an international event by staging a series of so-called platforms on different continents in the year leading up to the kassel show .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intention of these platfroms , according to statement from documenta officials , was " to bring the important artistic field to which documenta 11 belongs in dialogue with other fields and cities . "
the platforms were grouped according to theme : " democracy unrealized " in vienna and berlin ; " experiments with truth : transitional justice and the processes of truth and reconciliation " in new delhi ; " créolité and creolization " in st. lucia , and " under siege : four african cities " in freetown , johannesburg , kinshasa and lagos .
art in a social context in kassel , meanwhile , the show will include a broad spectrum of artists who are dealing with social problems in different parts of the world .
" where an artist comes from should not come into question , " said enwezor , a poet , critic and curator who is the publisher and founding editor of " nka : journal of contemporary african art , " which is co-published with the african studies center at cornell university .
chilean artist alfredo jaar , whose work deals with the situation on the border between the united states and mexico , is one of the artists included in the show .
new yorker lorna simpson , who deals with race discrimination , and belgian artist luc tuymans , who addresses issues of the colonial history of the congo , are also included .
multimedia performance on june 8 and june 9 , the theater-performance " confessions of zeno " by participating artist william kentridge will take place at the staatstheater kassel .
based on italo svevo ’ s novel la coscienza di zeno , the multimedia theater production uses puppetry , song , acting , music and video to explore experiences of labor and erotic pleasures of the european bourgeoisie prior to world war i. documenta 10 , held in 1997 , attracted a record 631,000 visitors and exhibition organizers are already warning about traffic jams and sold-out hotels during the first weeks of the show .

that may very well be the case this month as football fever reaches a feverish pitch .
but that doesn ’ t mean that women miss out on the fun , while their male counterparts drool over the ball being kicked around in seoul and tokyo to the exclusion of everything else .
in fact thousands of women all over the world have already begun enjoying the month-long tournament as soccer-inspired fashion and merchandise on the world ’ s catwalks and in boutiques lure them to loosen their purse strings .
dressed to be the football bride football is cool , trendy and it ’ s made an explosion in the unlikely world of haute couture .
while high fashion heavyweights such as prada , nina ricci and luis vuitton are all dabbling in luxurious soccer merchandise , several unusual soccer-inspired motifs have created a splash .

just two decades earlier , nazi officials had purged german museums of art they considered " degenerate , " including works by marc chagall , max ernst , käthe kollwitz , paul klee and wassily kandinsky .
many of these same artists – ernst , klee and kandinsky among them – were represented at the first documenta as bode worked to make good on the decades of destruction .
nearly half a century later , documenta 11 is set to open june 8 in kassel .
the art fair is staged every five years and is a major date in the european art calendar , rivalling venice 's biennale .
this time there will be five exhibition venues in town and works by more than 100 artists from around the world will be on display .
for the first time , documenta will use an industrial building – a former brewery – for the show , essentially doubling the exhibition space and making it one of europe ’ s largest art shows .
international platforms indeed this year 's artistic director of documenta 11 , nigerian-born okwui enwezor -lrb- photo -rrb- , set out to make it into an international event by staging a series of so-called platforms on different continents in the year leading up to the kassel show .

one of them is an eye-catching french silk gown featuring a head-dress in the shape of a football above a traditional veil in the shape of a net and a black-and-white motif embroidered across the bodice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dress -lrb- photo -rrb- designed by a local thai designer will hit the catwalks in early june in bangkok , where brides-to-be can buy it for a cool 50,000 baht -lrb- $ 1,168 -rrb- .
inspired by the " mystical " soccer ball another designer who is making waves with her football creations is south korean ji haye , who is excited about her country hosting the world cup .
so much so that she dedicated her last spring collection to the event .
she was reported to have found the pentagon and hexagon motifs on a football as " mystical " .
inspired by the black and white ball , she is known for her billowing dresses with puffed sleeves made of a patchwork of hexagons and pentagons using sheer and matt silk .
the " football " shoulder line is her trademark whether on a bolero jacket or a crisp white blouse worn over a stiff skirt .
and ji haye does not limit herself to a black and white palette , but indulges in vibrant colours for her creations .
one of her most stunning works so far is said to be an evening gown with a train encrusted with 15 kilos of swarovski crystals showing the variations on the polygons of a football in a multitude of hues .
even the french succumb to football fashion even the high-fashion capital paris is not immune to the booming popularity of combining fashion and football .
the celine fashion house recently offered a collection dedicated to sportswear with celine versions of shin guards and cleats : white ribbed leg warmers and delicately stitched leather sneaker-style shoes .
the clothes are trendy and sporty but with a distinctly refined parisian touch : whether it ’ s brief athletic shorts and skirts , hooded sweatshirts , stretch tank tops .
accessories include among others small round soccer ball purses with wrist straps , the hobo-style leather bags inspired by soccer balls and a wallet and leather cardholder said to have taken its cue from the referee ’ s penalty card .
beckham the trendiest in the uk in the uk , football fashion takes on an altogether different meaning what with women swooning over trendy , good-looking , football captain david beckham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david beckham recently the fashion magazine marie claire put beckham on the cover of its june edition , making him the first man to grace the cover in the magazine 's 14-year-history .
several high fashion stores in the uk have also introduced special world cup ranges which include among others sequinned bikinis in the colours of the union flag .
for daring japanese fans looking for " added support " and in the host country of japan , women soccer fans who aren ’ t content with just looking expensively pretty , but want to give a little extra-support to their teams , could try the specially designed " hat trick " bra .
the soccer-pitch green polyester bras by triumph international ltd. feature football-shaped pads in black and white imitation leather , topped with a trim designed to resemble a goal net .
the bra comes along with a pair of matching briefs , printed with an image of hands catching a ball .
the pair costs 17,000 yen -lrb- $ 133 -rrb- and is available in a limited edition at japanese department stores . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links world cup 2002 dw-world 's special on the world cup 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

just two decades earlier , nazi officials had purged german museums of art they considered " degenerate , " including works by marc chagall , max ernst , käthe kollwitz , paul klee and wassily kandinsky .
many of these same artists – ernst , klee and kandinsky among them – were represented at the first documenta as bode worked to make good on the decades of destruction .
nearly half a century later , documenta 11 is set to open june 8 in kassel .
the art fair is staged every five years and is a major date in the european art calendar , rivalling venice 's biennale .
this time there will be five exhibition venues in town and works by more than 100 artists from around the world will be on display .
for the first time , documenta will use an industrial building – a former brewery – for the show , essentially doubling the exhibition space and making it one of europe ’ s largest art shows .
international platforms indeed this year 's artistic director of documenta 11 , nigerian-born okwui enwezor -lrb- photo -rrb- , set out to make it into an international event by staging a series of so-called platforms on different continents in the year leading up to the kassel show .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intention of these platfroms , according to statement from documenta officials , was " to bring the important artistic field to which documenta 11 belongs in dialogue with other fields and cities . "
the platforms were grouped according to theme : " democracy unrealized " in vienna and berlin ; " experiments with truth : transitional justice and the processes of truth and reconciliation " in new delhi ; " créolité and creolization " in st. lucia , and " under siege : four african cities " in freetown , johannesburg , kinshasa and lagos .
art in a social context in kassel , meanwhile , the show will include a broad spectrum of artists who are dealing with social problems in different parts of the world .
" where an artist comes from should not come into question , " said enwezor , a poet , critic and curator who is the publisher and founding editor of " nka : journal of contemporary african art , " which is co-published with the african studies center at cornell university .
chilean artist alfredo jaar , whose work deals with the situation on the border between the united states and mexico , is one of the artists included in the show .
new yorker lorna simpson , who deals with race discrimination , and belgian artist luc tuymans , who addresses issues of the colonial history of the congo , are also included .
multimedia performance on june 8 and june 9 , the theater-performance " confessions of zeno " by participating artist william kentridge will take place at the staatstheater kassel .
based on italo svevo ’ s novel la coscienza di zeno , the multimedia theater production uses puppetry , song , acting , music and video to explore experiences of labor and erotic pleasures of the european bourgeoisie prior to world war i. documenta 10 , held in 1997 , attracted a record 631,000 visitors and exhibition organizers are already warning about traffic jams and sold-out hotels during the first weeks of the show .

the advisers presented a restructuring proposal earlier in the week to the group 's two top executives , wolfgang van betteray and hans-joachim ziems , as well as provisional insolvency administrator michael jaffé .
the plan provides for the cession of 66 % of the group 's activities , measured in terms of their capacity for revenue generation , in film and television production .
only the most high-earning entertainment production units are to be retained , according to the plan , while the units that are to be disposed of include ndf neue deutsche , production firm plazamediafilmgesellschaft and sport channel dsf .
van betteray , ziems and jaffé are under time pressure to agree on a restructuring plan .
they have two weeks at the most before insolvency proceedings are set to be opened .
when this happens , a rescue company - or more than one rescue companies - will be set up to absorb the businesses that are seen to be worth keeping .
the remaining businesses will be sold off individually .
under one proposal that 's under consideration , a separate rescue company is to be set up purely for kirch media 's activities in sports rights trading , the area in which the group had been most expansive in its last months before insolvency .
consideration is being given to the idea of paring down the sports rights business to the profitable big events such as the soccer world cup or the olympic games .
investment bank ubs warburg has been charged with the task of finding a buyer for the rescue company or companies , and it has reportedly received 55 offers .
the parties that have expressed interest include big hollywood studios , financial investors and european media groups .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's film library -lrb- ap photo / ho / kirchmedia -rrb- one major obstacle to an agreement is likely to be the differences between kirch media 's own estimates of the value of founder leo kirch 's massive film rights library and potential buyers ' estimates of its worth .
in the last available kirch media balance sheet , the library 's value is recorded as around 3 billion euro .
" the value is likely to be cut massively , " according to people close to the negotiations .
according to reports , only one third to a half of the film rights have any real worth at all .
if the library fails to fetch a good price , it will come as a blow to kirch media 's creditor-banks , since the group used the library as collateral against its loans .
in a separate development on thursday , the regional court in munich ruled that the kirch group media conglomerate - of which kirch media is a part - can retain control of its 40 % stake in europe 's largest newspaper publishing house , axel springer verlag , until august 30 .
but if the media group fails to repay its loan of 720 million euro to deutsche bank by that date , it must not challenge the bank 's right to seize the stake .
at the start of this year , deutsche 's chief executive , rolf breuer , publicly cast doubt on kirch group 's creditworthiness .
kirch 's lawyers , peter gauweiler and wolf-rüdiger bub , argued that this statement had affected the group 's reputation , and thereby hastened its demise .
thursday 's ruling suggests that the court was not totally unreceptive to this line of argument .
the ruling means that deutsche will not , for now , be able to go ahead with plans to float the springer shares on the stock market after the summer recess .
on wednesday , it was revealed that the plan had received the blessing of three banks who hold the right of veto : bayerische landesbank -lrb- bayernlb -rrb- , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
kirch used the springer stake as collateral against deutsche 's loan but also against a loan of 1.6 billion euro issued by bayernlb , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
in this connection , it has become customary to refer to this group of three banks as the formula one banks , because the loan was used to buy kirch 's stake in the formula one racing tournament .
deutsche was granted first right to the springer shares , giving it the right to dispose of the shares if , as happened , kirch failed to service its debt .
but the formula one banks were granted second right , giving them the power to veto any plans deutsche puts forward for the shares .
furthermore , they also have the right to take in any funds raised over and and above the sum that deutsche is owed .
banking insiders were expecting an excess of around 50 million euro , since the share issue was expected to rake in almost 800 million euro - a sum that would almost certainly have made it germany 's largest public offering by far this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 06.06.02 © economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2002 german women bank on investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika huber -lrb- right -rrb- and astrid hastreiter plan to establish a bank for women by 2003 .
the spiral , according to 41-year-old entrepreneur angelika huber , is an ancient symbol of femininity .
and yet she has chosen it as the logo for a brand new project – a bank for women . there are good reasons for opening a bank just for women , according to angelika huber .
" women think differently .
women approach technology differently .
and women have a different relationship to money , " she says .
" conventional banks do n't always support the way women do business . "
huber herself is rich in business credentials .
in 1990 she founded a women 's computer school in munich .
three years ago , the school became a joint stock company and has generated over euro 1 million in income .
huber also manages a publishing house and works as a consultant .
huber and her business partner astrid hastreiter started collecting the capital needed to establish a bank in germany - € 5m .
the two women sent tens of thousands of emails seeking investment in the project .
through market analyses huber and hastreiter found they had developed a sound concept , but the women 's bank has had to be put on the backburner while they collect more funds , resolve legal problems expand their skeleton team .
and they 're off huber describes herself as someone who is more inclined to shift an appointment forward , rather than postpone it .
she has no intention of letting the project lose momentum .
this friday , the bank came one step closer to becoming a reality .
in munich , huber and hastreiter launched the women 's investment management company , where the funds will be held in trust for the bank .
" today the project moved from a political stage to an economic one , " huber said .
in a year 's time , she hopes the bank will be operating .
by 2004 , it will offer full banking services to women , including personal savings accounts .
why a women 's bank ?
a decade ago , the german consumers ' organization ' stiftung warentest ' discovered that banks were providing male customers with better service than women , because they had less trust in women 's competence in financial matters .
in the ten years since , banks have recognized that women represent a special market , and they now offer services and advice to attract female customers .
in recent years , finance seminars for women have become common , and some banks even advertise better rates for women .
but that 's not enough , say huber and hastreiter .
it 's still much harder for women to get loans .
one of the goals of the women 's bank is to offer small loans of up to 15,000 for company start-ups or university studies .
the grameen bank in bangladesh and sewa in india have been operating in this way since the 1970s , providing microcredit to assist women in getting small projects off the ground .
the idea of a women-friendly bank is not new to germany .
a women 's bank existed in berlin in 1910 .
the first world war caused its collapse .
another bank with political objectives , the ecobank , met the same fate in june last year .
after a number of loans failed , it became insolvent and its 22,000 customers lost more than euro 2.7m.
we 'll do it our way huber was herself a member of the ecobank co-operative and lost money when it went bankrupt .
but that has n't deterred her .
the women 's bank , she says , wo n't make the same mistakes .
but it will invest in environmental funds .
profits from the bank will be invested in environmental and social projects .
huber says women are much more interested than men in investing ethically .
they own nearly eighty percent of all environmental investments .
huber says what will distinguish the women 's bank from ' ordinary ' banks is that it will cater to the needs of a particular group , rather than simply selling products .
huber and hastreiter are keen to stress that their bank is not a social service or a charity .
it will be managed by a small team , so as to keep costs down .
the offices will be based in munich , but services will only be offered online .
huber says the women 's bank is intended to be woman-friendly , not hostile to men .
and yes , men will be able to use its services , if they 're willing to take the risk ! send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the women 's bank the home page of the women 's bank -lrb- in german -rrb- german banks online general information from the association of german banks -lrb- in english -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david beckham the most attractive clash in the first phase kicked off in sapporo , japan with pressure on both sides .
it was a game neither side could afford to lose .
destiny pitted historic rivals against each other ever since destiny brought out the two team names together from the world cup hat , the media and fans alike have been reliving everything from the falklands war of 1982 to the ‘ hand of god ’ incident in mexico ’ 86 .
although both aspects had been talked up beyond hype , the result would be far greater than the sum of its parts .
with argentina , the almost obsessive desire to put english football in its place might have inspired the players more than their need to win .
after beating nigeria in their first game , the much fancied argentines were plotting a good course to the second round .
england , who had disappointed more than their own nation with a stale and uninventive draw with sweden , also had pride on their list of targets but the all important three points remained the only option if they hoped to progress further .
errors and injuries built up nailbiting tension the game began in a flourish of scrappy , hurried passes and tackles .
the pace in the opening exchanges was to set the tempo for the whole match as both teams rose to the challenge .
the frantic opening saw first zanetti and then killy gonzalez test england keeper david seaman but the experienced arsenal goalie was positioned well to deal with both attacks .
the desire to press forward for both teams led to an early rash of mistimed tackles and late challenges that increased the temperature on the pitch .
england responded well with fair commitment while frustration crept into the argentine game .
this resulted in a 12 minute booking for striker gabriel batistuta .
england , having floundered without any left sided stability in their first match , once again showed their weakness by filling the job no-one wants with paul scholes , a more natural and accomplished centre player .
with nicky butt and owen hargreaves holding the middle , england eventually settled only to be disrupted by hargreaves limping off in the 18th minute .
the clincher his replacement , trevor sinclair , added width to the midfield , dropping into the wide left role and allowing scholes to return to the centre .
sinclair made his first contribution a telling one when he combined well in the build up that saw michael owen hit the post squarely after 23 minutes .
argentina were forced back as england surged forward in a reverse of their negative play against sweden .
the physical battle was still very much still up for grabs as clashes across the pitch led to a number of verbal warnings and free kicks .
england ’ s ashley cole picked up a yellow card on the half hour .
sinclair was causing more problems on the left and after the england defence had recovered from a gonzalez volley that flashed over the bar , the west ham player fed the ball into michael owen in the argentine box .
owen twisted and showed a clean pair of heels to mauricio pochettino before being brought down by the defender .
beckham picked up the ball and showed a captain ’ s composure to rifle the penalty in low past the static burgos .

the spiral , according to 41-year-old entrepreneur angelika huber , is an ancient symbol of femininity .
and yet she has chosen it as the logo for a brand new project – a bank for women . there are good reasons for opening a bank just for women , according to angelika huber .
" women think differently .
women approach technology differently .
and women have a different relationship to money , " she says .
" conventional banks do n't always support the way women do business . "
huber herself is rich in business credentials .
in 1990 she founded a women 's computer school in munich .
three years ago , the school became a joint stock company and has generated over euro 1 million in income .
huber also manages a publishing house and works as a consultant .
huber and her business partner astrid hastreiter started collecting the capital needed to establish a bank in germany - € 5m .
the two women sent tens of thousands of emails seeking investment in the project .
through market analyses huber and hastreiter found they had developed a sound concept , but the women 's bank has had to be put on the backburner while they collect more funds , resolve legal problems expand their skeleton team .
and they 're off huber describes herself as someone who is more inclined to shift an appointment forward , rather than postpone it .
she has no intention of letting the project lose momentum .
this friday , the bank came one step closer to becoming a reality .
in munich , huber and hastreiter launched the women 's investment management company , where the funds will be held in trust for the bank .
" today the project moved from a political stage to an economic one , " huber said .
in a year 's time , she hopes the bank will be operating .
by 2004 , it will offer full banking services to women , including personal savings accounts .
why a women 's bank ?
a decade ago , the german consumers ' organization ' stiftung warentest ' discovered that banks were providing male customers with better service than women , because they had less trust in women 's competence in financial matters .
in the ten years since , banks have recognized that women represent a special market , and they now offer services and advice to attract female customers .
in recent years , finance seminars for women have become common , and some banks even advertise better rates for women .
but that 's not enough , say huber and hastreiter .
it 's still much harder for women to get loans .
one of the goals of the women 's bank is to offer small loans of up to 15,000 for company start-ups or university studies .
the grameen bank in bangladesh and sewa in india have been operating in this way since the 1970s , providing microcredit to assist women in getting small projects off the ground .
the idea of a women-friendly bank is not new to germany .
a women 's bank existed in berlin in 1910 .
the first world war caused its collapse .
another bank with political objectives , the ecobank , met the same fate in june last year .
after a number of loans failed , it became insolvent and its 22,000 customers lost more than euro 2.7m.
we 'll do it our way huber was herself a member of the ecobank co-operative and lost money when it went bankrupt .
but that has n't deterred her .
the women 's bank , she says , wo n't make the same mistakes .
but it will invest in environmental funds .
profits from the bank will be invested in environmental and social projects .
huber says women are much more interested than men in investing ethically .
they own nearly eighty percent of all environmental investments .
huber says what will distinguish the women 's bank from ' ordinary ' banks is that it will cater to the needs of a particular group , rather than simply selling products .
huber and hastreiter are keen to stress that their bank is not a social service or a charity .
it will be managed by a small team , so as to keep costs down .
the offices will be based in munich , but services will only be offered online .
huber says the women 's bank is intended to be woman-friendly , not hostile to men .

the spiral , according to 41-year-old entrepreneur angelika huber , is an ancient symbol of femininity .
and yet she has chosen it as the logo for a brand new project – a bank for women . there are good reasons for opening a bank just for women , according to angelika huber .
" women think differently .
women approach technology differently .
and women have a different relationship to money , " she says .
" conventional banks do n't always support the way women do business . "
huber herself is rich in business credentials .
in 1990 she founded a women 's computer school in munich .
three years ago , the school became a joint stock company and has generated over euro 1 million in income .
huber also manages a publishing house and works as a consultant .
huber and her business partner astrid hastreiter started collecting the capital needed to establish a bank in germany - € 5m .
the two women sent tens of thousands of emails seeking investment in the project .
through market analyses huber and hastreiter found they had developed a sound concept , but the women 's bank has had to be put on the backburner while they collect more funds , resolve legal problems expand their skeleton team .
and they 're off huber describes herself as someone who is more inclined to shift an appointment forward , rather than postpone it .
she has no intention of letting the project lose momentum .
this friday , the bank came one step closer to becoming a reality .
in munich , huber and hastreiter launched the women 's investment management company , where the funds will be held in trust for the bank .
" today the project moved from a political stage to an economic one , " huber said .
in a year 's time , she hopes the bank will be operating .
by 2004 , it will offer full banking services to women , including personal savings accounts .
why a women 's bank ?
a decade ago , the german consumers ' organization ' stiftung warentest ' discovered that banks were providing male customers with better service than women , because they had less trust in women 's competence in financial matters .
in the ten years since , banks have recognized that women represent a special market , and they now offer services and advice to attract female customers .
in recent years , finance seminars for women have become common , and some banks even advertise better rates for women .
but that 's not enough , say huber and hastreiter .
it 's still much harder for women to get loans .
one of the goals of the women 's bank is to offer small loans of up to 15,000 for company start-ups or university studies .
the grameen bank in bangladesh and sewa in india have been operating in this way since the 1970s , providing microcredit to assist women in getting small projects off the ground .
the idea of a women-friendly bank is not new to germany .
a women 's bank existed in berlin in 1910 .
the first world war caused its collapse .
another bank with political objectives , the ecobank , met the same fate in june last year .
after a number of loans failed , it became insolvent and its 22,000 customers lost more than euro 2.7m.
we 'll do it our way huber was herself a member of the ecobank co-operative and lost money when it went bankrupt .
but that has n't deterred her .
the women 's bank , she says , wo n't make the same mistakes .
but it will invest in environmental funds .
profits from the bank will be invested in environmental and social projects .
huber says women are much more interested than men in investing ethically .
they own nearly eighty percent of all environmental investments .
huber says what will distinguish the women 's bank from ' ordinary ' banks is that it will cater to the needs of a particular group , rather than simply selling products .
huber and hastreiter are keen to stress that their bank is not a social service or a charity .
it will be managed by a small team , so as to keep costs down .
the offices will be based in munich , but services will only be offered online .
huber says the women 's bank is intended to be woman-friendly , not hostile to men .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2002 kirch media set to be pared down to the core großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite dishes of kirch media group 's tv channels handelsblatt has learned that administrators see a dramatically streamlined kirch media holding group emerging from its insolvency process . advisers have recommended that the company succeeding the insolvent kirch media holding group should essentially be pared down to its original core business of film rights trading plus its majority stake in listed television group pro sieben sat 1 media ag , handelsblatt has learned .
the advisers presented a restructuring proposal earlier in the week to the group 's two top executives , wolfgang van betteray and hans-joachim ziems , as well as provisional insolvency administrator michael jaffé .
the plan provides for the cession of 66 % of the group 's activities , measured in terms of their capacity for revenue generation , in film and television production .
only the most high-earning entertainment production units are to be retained , according to the plan , while the units that are to be disposed of include ndf neue deutsche , production firm plazamediafilmgesellschaft and sport channel dsf .
van betteray , ziems and jaffé are under time pressure to agree on a restructuring plan .
they have two weeks at the most before insolvency proceedings are set to be opened .
when this happens , a rescue company - or more than one rescue companies - will be set up to absorb the businesses that are seen to be worth keeping .
the remaining businesses will be sold off individually .
under one proposal that 's under consideration , a separate rescue company is to be set up purely for kirch media 's activities in sports rights trading , the area in which the group had been most expansive in its last months before insolvency .
consideration is being given to the idea of paring down the sports rights business to the profitable big events such as the soccer world cup or the olympic games .
investment bank ubs warburg has been charged with the task of finding a buyer for the rescue company or companies , and it has reportedly received 55 offers .
the parties that have expressed interest include big hollywood studios , financial investors and european media groups .
the selection process is set to get underway at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's film library -lrb- ap photo / ho / kirchmedia -rrb- one major obstacle to an agreement is likely to be the differences between kirch media 's own estimates of the value of founder leo kirch 's massive film rights library and potential buyers ' estimates of its worth .
in the last available kirch media balance sheet , the library 's value is recorded as around 3 billion euro .
" the value is likely to be cut massively , " according to people close to the negotiations .
according to reports , only one third to a half of the film rights have any real worth at all .
if the library fails to fetch a good price , it will come as a blow to kirch media 's creditor-banks , since the group used the library as collateral against its loans .
in a separate development on thursday , the regional court in munich ruled that the kirch group media conglomerate - of which kirch media is a part - can retain control of its 40 % stake in europe 's largest newspaper publishing house , axel springer verlag , until august 30 .
but if the media group fails to repay its loan of 720 million euro to deutsche bank by that date , it must not challenge the bank 's right to seize the stake .
at the start of this year , deutsche 's chief executive , rolf breuer , publicly cast doubt on kirch group 's creditworthiness .
kirch 's lawyers , peter gauweiler and wolf-rüdiger bub , argued that this statement had affected the group 's reputation , and thereby hastened its demise .
thursday 's ruling suggests that the court was not totally unreceptive to this line of argument .
the ruling means that deutsche will not , for now , be able to go ahead with plans to float the springer shares on the stock market after the summer recess .
on wednesday , it was revealed that the plan had received the blessing of three banks who hold the right of veto : bayerische landesbank -lrb- bayernlb -rrb- , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
kirch used the springer stake as collateral against deutsche 's loan but also against a loan of 1.6 billion euro issued by bayernlb , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
in this connection , it has become customary to refer to this group of three banks as the formula one banks , because the loan was used to buy kirch 's stake in the formula one racing tournament .
deutsche was granted first right to the springer shares , giving it the right to dispose of the shares if , as happened , kirch failed to service its debt .
but the formula one banks were granted second right , giving them the power to veto any plans deutsche puts forward for the shares .
furthermore , they also have the right to take in any funds raised over and and above the sum that deutsche is owed .
banking insiders were expecting an excess of around 50 million euro , since the share issue was expected to rake in almost 800 million euro - a sum that would almost certainly have made it germany 's largest public offering by far this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 06.06.02 © economy .

in this connection , it has become customary to refer to this group of three banks as the formula one banks , because the loan was used to buy kirch 's stake in the formula one racing tournament .
deutsche was granted first right to the springer shares , giving it the right to dispose of the shares if , as happened , kirch failed to service its debt .
but the formula one banks were granted second right , giving them the power to veto any plans deutsche puts forward for the shares .
furthermore , they also have the right to take in any funds raised over and and above the sum that deutsche is owed .
banking insiders were expecting an excess of around 50 million euro , since the share issue was expected to rake in almost 800 million euro - a sum that would almost certainly have made it germany 's largest public offering by far this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 06.06.02 © economy .

the spiral , according to 41-year-old entrepreneur angelika huber , is an ancient symbol of femininity .
and yet she has chosen it as the logo for a brand new project – a bank for women . there are good reasons for opening a bank just for women , according to angelika huber .
" women think differently .
women approach technology differently .
and women have a different relationship to money , " she says .
" conventional banks do n't always support the way women do business . "
huber herself is rich in business credentials .
in 1990 she founded a women 's computer school in munich .
three years ago , the school became a joint stock company and has generated over euro 1 million in income .
huber also manages a publishing house and works as a consultant .
huber and her business partner astrid hastreiter started collecting the capital needed to establish a bank in germany - € 5m .
the two women sent tens of thousands of emails seeking investment in the project .
through market analyses huber and hastreiter found they had developed a sound concept , but the women 's bank has had to be put on the backburner while they collect more funds , resolve legal problems expand their skeleton team .
and they 're off huber describes herself as someone who is more inclined to shift an appointment forward , rather than postpone it .
she has no intention of letting the project lose momentum .
this friday , the bank came one step closer to becoming a reality .
in munich , huber and hastreiter launched the women 's investment management company , where the funds will be held in trust for the bank .
" today the project moved from a political stage to an economic one , " huber said .
in a year 's time , she hopes the bank will be operating .
by 2004 , it will offer full banking services to women , including personal savings accounts .
why a women 's bank ?
a decade ago , the german consumers ' organization ' stiftung warentest ' discovered that banks were providing male customers with better service than women , because they had less trust in women 's competence in financial matters .
in the ten years since , banks have recognized that women represent a special market , and they now offer services and advice to attract female customers .
in recent years , finance seminars for women have become common , and some banks even advertise better rates for women .
but that 's not enough , say huber and hastreiter .
it 's still much harder for women to get loans .
one of the goals of the women 's bank is to offer small loans of up to 15,000 for company start-ups or university studies .
the grameen bank in bangladesh and sewa in india have been operating in this way since the 1970s , providing microcredit to assist women in getting small projects off the ground .
the idea of a women-friendly bank is not new to germany .
a women 's bank existed in berlin in 1910 .
the first world war caused its collapse .
another bank with political objectives , the ecobank , met the same fate in june last year .
after a number of loans failed , it became insolvent and its 22,000 customers lost more than euro 2.7m.
we 'll do it our way huber was herself a member of the ecobank co-operative and lost money when it went bankrupt .
but that has n't deterred her .
the women 's bank , she says , wo n't make the same mistakes .
but it will invest in environmental funds .
profits from the bank will be invested in environmental and social projects .
huber says women are much more interested than men in investing ethically .
they own nearly eighty percent of all environmental investments .
huber says what will distinguish the women 's bank from ' ordinary ' banks is that it will cater to the needs of a particular group , rather than simply selling products .
huber and hastreiter are keen to stress that their bank is not a social service or a charity .
it will be managed by a small team , so as to keep costs down .
the offices will be based in munich , but services will only be offered online .
huber says the women 's bank is intended to be woman-friendly , not hostile to men .
and yes , men will be able to use its services , if they 're willing to take the risk ! send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the women 's bank the home page of the women 's bank -lrb- in german -rrb- german banks online general information from the association of german banks -lrb- in english -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the advisers presented a restructuring proposal earlier in the week to the group 's two top executives , wolfgang van betteray and hans-joachim ziems , as well as provisional insolvency administrator michael jaffé .
the plan provides for the cession of 66 % of the group 's activities , measured in terms of their capacity for revenue generation , in film and television production .
only the most high-earning entertainment production units are to be retained , according to the plan , while the units that are to be disposed of include ndf neue deutsche , production firm plazamediafilmgesellschaft and sport channel dsf .
van betteray , ziems and jaffé are under time pressure to agree on a restructuring plan .
they have two weeks at the most before insolvency proceedings are set to be opened .
when this happens , a rescue company - or more than one rescue companies - will be set up to absorb the businesses that are seen to be worth keeping .
the remaining businesses will be sold off individually .
under one proposal that 's under consideration , a separate rescue company is to be set up purely for kirch media 's activities in sports rights trading , the area in which the group had been most expansive in its last months before insolvency .
consideration is being given to the idea of paring down the sports rights business to the profitable big events such as the soccer world cup or the olympic games .
investment bank ubs warburg has been charged with the task of finding a buyer for the rescue company or companies , and it has reportedly received 55 offers .
the parties that have expressed interest include big hollywood studios , financial investors and european media groups .
the selection process is set to get underway at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's film library -lrb- ap photo / ho / kirchmedia -rrb- one major obstacle to an agreement is likely to be the differences between kirch media 's own estimates of the value of founder leo kirch 's massive film rights library and potential buyers ' estimates of its worth .
in the last available kirch media balance sheet , the library 's value is recorded as around 3 billion euro .
" the value is likely to be cut massively , " according to people close to the negotiations .
according to reports , only one third to a half of the film rights have any real worth at all .
if the library fails to fetch a good price , it will come as a blow to kirch media 's creditor-banks , since the group used the library as collateral against its loans .
in a separate development on thursday , the regional court in munich ruled that the kirch group media conglomerate - of which kirch media is a part - can retain control of its 40 % stake in europe 's largest newspaper publishing house , axel springer verlag , until august 30 .
but if the media group fails to repay its loan of 720 million euro to deutsche bank by that date , it must not challenge the bank 's right to seize the stake .
at the start of this year , deutsche 's chief executive , rolf breuer , publicly cast doubt on kirch group 's creditworthiness .
kirch 's lawyers , peter gauweiler and wolf-rüdiger bub , argued that this statement had affected the group 's reputation , and thereby hastened its demise .
thursday 's ruling suggests that the court was not totally unreceptive to this line of argument .
the ruling means that deutsche will not , for now , be able to go ahead with plans to float the springer shares on the stock market after the summer recess .
on wednesday , it was revealed that the plan had received the blessing of three banks who hold the right of veto : bayerische landesbank -lrb- bayernlb -rrb- , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
kirch used the springer stake as collateral against deutsche 's loan but also against a loan of 1.6 billion euro issued by bayernlb , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .

he said the country would break in singing .
in may 2002 , estonia became the first among eu candidate countries to host the glitzy eurovision song contest .

although estonia shone brightly during the eurovision song contest last may , it still has some tough hurdles to tackle before it can bask in the glow of the eu . when estonia won the eurovision song contest last year , former prime minister mart laar said that estonia didn ‘ t need to knock at the door of europe .
he said the country would break in singing .
in may 2002 , estonia became the first among eu candidate countries to host the glitzy eurovision song contest .
the event gave the small baltic nation an opportunity not shared by its counterparts - a chance to shine on the european stage .
thousands of international guests attended the contest in the medieval capital of tallinn where they got to experience first-hand a segment of estonia .
in addition , extensive media coverage also gave millions of europeans an introduction into their soon-to-be neighbor .
for many sitting back home in front of their television sets , this was the first time they saw images of their future eu partner .
and the question for many remains , can estonia offer more to europe than a stunning musical spectacle ?
political support for accession estonian prime minister siim kallas , who took up office in january , has promised to bring the decade-long drive to win eu and nato membership to a successful end this year .
" we are expected to bring these processes to a conclusion , " said kallas at his swearing-in ceremony .
" and let me promise you here that all necessary decisions will be taken , with responsibility and with competence . "
but estonia still faces difficult negotiations with brussels .
it has closed only 24 of the 31 negotiating " chapters " , or policy areas , required by the eu .
one crucial point is the country ’ s energy sector , in particular the country ’ s prime mineral resource , oil shale .
it makes estonia ’ s energy system independent from neighboring countries , and for political reasons it does not want to give that up .
the eu , however , is concerned about the environmental impact of this fuel .
burning massive quantities of oil shale has severely increased the pollution of the atmosphere , land and groundwater .

another issue in dispute is taxation .
the eu abolished duty-free purchases from july 1 , 1999 .
since then , estonia has become a tax-free haven for northern europeans , in particular .
many scandinavians take up offers for short jaunts to tallinn by ship to benefit from travel to a duty-free region - and duty-free bargains onboard .
with accession to the eu , estonia would have to end its duty-free policies .
this would have negative implications for this sector .
estonia is asking for a transitional period for retaining duty-free sales .
according to the estonian ministry of foreign affairs , the country hopes to reach agreement in the areas of taxation and energy by the end of the spanish eu presidency on june 30 , 2002 .
public opinion improving the estonian poll firm emor has registered a rise in " euro-optimists " over the past six months .
a recent survey showed that 59 % of estonian citizens support eu accession .
35 % don ’ t support or object to the move .
emor ’ s division manager , aivar voog , says that the attitude towards eu accession depended greatly on the self-esteem of estonian people .

although estonia shone brightly during the eurovision song contest last may , it still has some tough hurdles to tackle before it can bask in the glow of the eu . when estonia won the eurovision song contest last year , former prime minister mart laar said that estonia didn ‘ t need to knock at the door of europe .
he said the country would break in singing .
in may 2002 , estonia became the first among eu candidate countries to host the glitzy eurovision song contest .
the event gave the small baltic nation an opportunity not shared by its counterparts - a chance to shine on the european stage .
thousands of international guests attended the contest in the medieval capital of tallinn where they got to experience first-hand a segment of estonia .
in addition , extensive media coverage also gave millions of europeans an introduction into their soon-to-be neighbor .
for many sitting back home in front of their television sets , this was the first time they saw images of their future eu partner .
and the question for many remains , can estonia offer more to europe than a stunning musical spectacle ?
political support for accession estonian prime minister siim kallas , who took up office in january , has promised to bring the decade-long drive to win eu and nato membership to a successful end this year .
" we are expected to bring these processes to a conclusion , " said kallas at his swearing-in ceremony .
" and let me promise you here that all necessary decisions will be taken , with responsibility and with competence . "
but estonia still faces difficult negotiations with brussels .
it has closed only 24 of the 31 negotiating " chapters " , or policy areas , required by the eu .
one crucial point is the country ’ s energy sector , in particular the country ’ s prime mineral resource , oil shale .
it makes estonia ’ s energy system independent from neighboring countries , and for political reasons it does not want to give that up .
the eu , however , is concerned about the environmental impact of this fuel .
burning massive quantities of oil shale has severely increased the pollution of the atmosphere , land and groundwater .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers aboard a senna sealink ferry travelling from dover , england to calais , france search for duty free .
another issue in dispute is taxation .
the eu abolished duty-free purchases from july 1 , 1999 .
since then , estonia has become a tax-free haven for northern europeans , in particular .
many scandinavians take up offers for short jaunts to tallinn by ship to benefit from travel to a duty-free region - and duty-free bargains onboard .
with accession to the eu , estonia would have to end its duty-free policies .
this would have negative implications for this sector .
estonia is asking for a transitional period for retaining duty-free sales .
according to the estonian ministry of foreign affairs , the country hopes to reach agreement in the areas of taxation and energy by the end of the spanish eu presidency on june 30 , 2002 .
public opinion improving the estonian poll firm emor has registered a rise in " euro-optimists " over the past six months .
a recent survey showed that 59 % of estonian citizens support eu accession .
35 % don ’ t support or object to the move .
emor ’ s division manager , aivar voog , says that the attitude towards eu accession depended greatly on the self-esteem of estonian people .
" the more self-confident the people are , the more boldly they make decisions towards changes , " he notes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe in transition romania — still a long way to go poland 's limp into the eu the czech republic - a bumpy ride into the eu lithuania 's search for security current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2002 estonia needs more than a good show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain aspects of capitalist lifestyle have already hit estonia .
although estonia shone brightly during the eurovision song contest last may , it still has some tough hurdles to tackle before it can bask in the glow of the eu . when estonia won the eurovision song contest last year , former prime minister mart laar said that estonia didn ‘ t need to knock at the door of europe .
he said the country would break in singing .
in may 2002 , estonia became the first among eu candidate countries to host the glitzy eurovision song contest .
the event gave the small baltic nation an opportunity not shared by its counterparts - a chance to shine on the european stage .
thousands of international guests attended the contest in the medieval capital of tallinn where they got to experience first-hand a segment of estonia .
in addition , extensive media coverage also gave millions of europeans an introduction into their soon-to-be neighbor .
for many sitting back home in front of their television sets , this was the first time they saw images of their future eu partner .
and the question for many remains , can estonia offer more to europe than a stunning musical spectacle ?
political support for accession estonian prime minister siim kallas , who took up office in january , has promised to bring the decade-long drive to win eu and nato membership to a successful end this year .
" we are expected to bring these processes to a conclusion , " said kallas at his swearing-in ceremony .
" and let me promise you here that all necessary decisions will be taken , with responsibility and with competence . "
but estonia still faces difficult negotiations with brussels .
it has closed only 24 of the 31 negotiating " chapters " , or policy areas , required by the eu .
one crucial point is the country ’ s energy sector , in particular the country ’ s prime mineral resource , oil shale .
it makes estonia ’ s energy system independent from neighboring countries , and for political reasons it does not want to give that up .
the eu , however , is concerned about the environmental impact of this fuel .
burning massive quantities of oil shale has severely increased the pollution of the atmosphere , land and groundwater .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers aboard a senna sealink ferry travelling from dover , england to calais , france search for duty free .
another issue in dispute is taxation .
the eu abolished duty-free purchases from july 1 , 1999 .
since then , estonia has become a tax-free haven for northern europeans , in particular .
many scandinavians take up offers for short jaunts to tallinn by ship to benefit from travel to a duty-free region - and duty-free bargains onboard .
with accession to the eu , estonia would have to end its duty-free policies .
this would have negative implications for this sector .
estonia is asking for a transitional period for retaining duty-free sales .
according to the estonian ministry of foreign affairs , the country hopes to reach agreement in the areas of taxation and energy by the end of the spanish eu presidency on june 30 , 2002 .
public opinion improving the estonian poll firm emor has registered a rise in " euro-optimists " over the past six months .
a recent survey showed that 59 % of estonian citizens support eu accession .
35 % don ’ t support or object to the move .
emor ’ s division manager , aivar voog , says that the attitude towards eu accession depended greatly on the self-esteem of estonian people .
" the more self-confident the people are , the more boldly they make decisions towards changes , " he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanel padar from estonia , the winner of the 2001 eurovision song contest , holds his trophy and his country 's flag as he celebrates his victory in copenhagen , denmark , saturday , may 12 , 2001 .
tanel padar and dave benton , a native of the caribbean island of aruba , entertained 38,000 fans with their swinging " everybody . "
-lrb- ap photo / alastair grant -rrb- a general improvement in attitude has made the population more optimistic on eu accession .
voog says the eurovision song contest has had a positive effect on the " euro-support " curve -lrb- photo : last year 's winner , estonia 's tanel padar -rrb- .
but the european commission ‘ s eurobarometer says personal opinion is much lower .
" in estonia , we registered extremely low optimism regarding expected personal advantages from future eu membership , " the commission discovered .
only one in four respondents think that they would personally benefit from accession .
this makes estonians the least optimistic among the candidate countries .
cultural fears many people also see european integration as a potential threat to estonian culture and identity .
this is primarily due to the country ’ s historical ties to russia .
since its independence in 1991 , estonia has reoriented trade away from russian markets to eu member states .
but while its powerful eastern neighbor is now less evident economically , it still is a presence in society , namely through estonia ’ s russian-speaking residents .
most of this minority group has no citizenship .
while institutions such as the eu and nato promote the naturalization of these residents , many estonians place them in the russian cultural realm , alien to estonia .
international integration is thus often depicted as dangerous to estonian identity .
estonia is in a difficult position .
should it become part of the eu , it will mark the border between the european union and a non-eu russia .
eu and nato memberships are seen as prerequisites for estonia ’ s security against russia .
but eu accession would also require massive naturalization of " civilisationally alien " non-estonians . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe in transition our series " europe in transition " , produced in co-operation with the german and ukrainian services of deutsche welle , looks at the situation in the 12 countries hoping to join the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2002 kirch media set to be pared down to the core großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite dishes of kirch media group 's tv channels handelsblatt has learned that administrators see a dramatically streamlined kirch media holding group emerging from its insolvency process . advisers have recommended that the company succeeding the insolvent kirch media holding group should essentially be pared down to its original core business of film rights trading plus its majority stake in listed television group pro sieben sat 1 media ag , handelsblatt has learned .
the advisers presented a restructuring proposal earlier in the week to the group 's two top executives , wolfgang van betteray and hans-joachim ziems , as well as provisional insolvency administrator michael jaffé .
the plan provides for the cession of 66 % of the group 's activities , measured in terms of their capacity for revenue generation , in film and television production .
only the most high-earning entertainment production units are to be retained , according to the plan , while the units that are to be disposed of include ndf neue deutsche , production firm plazamediafilmgesellschaft and sport channel dsf .
van betteray , ziems and jaffé are under time pressure to agree on a restructuring plan .
they have two weeks at the most before insolvency proceedings are set to be opened .
when this happens , a rescue company - or more than one rescue companies - will be set up to absorb the businesses that are seen to be worth keeping .
the remaining businesses will be sold off individually .
under one proposal that 's under consideration , a separate rescue company is to be set up purely for kirch media 's activities in sports rights trading , the area in which the group had been most expansive in its last months before insolvency .
consideration is being given to the idea of paring down the sports rights business to the profitable big events such as the soccer world cup or the olympic games .
investment bank ubs warburg has been charged with the task of finding a buyer for the rescue company or companies , and it has reportedly received 55 offers .
the parties that have expressed interest include big hollywood studios , financial investors and european media groups .
the selection process is set to get underway at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's film library -lrb- ap photo / ho / kirchmedia -rrb- one major obstacle to an agreement is likely to be the differences between kirch media 's own estimates of the value of founder leo kirch 's massive film rights library and potential buyers ' estimates of its worth .
in the last available kirch media balance sheet , the library 's value is recorded as around 3 billion euro .
" the value is likely to be cut massively , " according to people close to the negotiations .
according to reports , only one third to a half of the film rights have any real worth at all .
if the library fails to fetch a good price , it will come as a blow to kirch media 's creditor-banks , since the group used the library as collateral against its loans .
in a separate development on thursday , the regional court in munich ruled that the kirch group media conglomerate - of which kirch media is a part - can retain control of its 40 % stake in europe 's largest newspaper publishing house , axel springer verlag , until august 30 .
but if the media group fails to repay its loan of 720 million euro to deutsche bank by that date , it must not challenge the bank 's right to seize the stake .
at the start of this year , deutsche 's chief executive , rolf breuer , publicly cast doubt on kirch group 's creditworthiness .
kirch 's lawyers , peter gauweiler and wolf-rüdiger bub , argued that this statement had affected the group 's reputation , and thereby hastened its demise .
thursday 's ruling suggests that the court was not totally unreceptive to this line of argument .
the ruling means that deutsche will not , for now , be able to go ahead with plans to float the springer shares on the stock market after the summer recess .
on wednesday , it was revealed that the plan had received the blessing of three banks who hold the right of veto : bayerische landesbank -lrb- bayernlb -rrb- , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
kirch used the springer stake as collateral against deutsche 's loan but also against a loan of 1.6 billion euro issued by bayernlb , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
in this connection , it has become customary to refer to this group of three banks as the formula one banks , because the loan was used to buy kirch 's stake in the formula one racing tournament .
deutsche was granted first right to the springer shares , giving it the right to dispose of the shares if , as happened , kirch failed to service its debt .
but the formula one banks were granted second right , giving them the power to veto any plans deutsche puts forward for the shares .
furthermore , they also have the right to take in any funds raised over and and above the sum that deutsche is owed .
banking insiders were expecting an excess of around 50 million euro , since the share issue was expected to rake in almost 800 million euro - a sum that would almost certainly have made it germany 's largest public offering by far this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 06.06.02 © economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2002 german women bank on investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika huber -lrb- right -rrb- and astrid hastreiter plan to establish a bank for women by 2003 .
the spiral , according to 41-year-old entrepreneur angelika huber , is an ancient symbol of femininity .
and yet she has chosen it as the logo for a brand new project – a bank for women . there are good reasons for opening a bank just for women , according to angelika huber .
" women think differently .
women approach technology differently .
and women have a different relationship to money , " she says .
" conventional banks do n't always support the way women do business . "
huber herself is rich in business credentials .
in 1990 she founded a women 's computer school in munich .
three years ago , the school became a joint stock company and has generated over euro 1 million in income .
huber also manages a publishing house and works as a consultant .
huber and her business partner astrid hastreiter started collecting the capital needed to establish a bank in germany - € 5m .
the two women sent tens of thousands of emails seeking investment in the project .
through market analyses huber and hastreiter found they had developed a sound concept , but the women 's bank has had to be put on the backburner while they collect more funds , resolve legal problems expand their skeleton team .
and they 're off huber describes herself as someone who is more inclined to shift an appointment forward , rather than postpone it .
she has no intention of letting the project lose momentum .
this friday , the bank came one step closer to becoming a reality .
in munich , huber and hastreiter launched the women 's investment management company , where the funds will be held in trust for the bank .
" today the project moved from a political stage to an economic one , " huber said .
in a year 's time , she hopes the bank will be operating .
by 2004 , it will offer full banking services to women , including personal savings accounts .
why a women 's bank ?
a decade ago , the german consumers ' organization ' stiftung warentest ' discovered that banks were providing male customers with better service than women , because they had less trust in women 's competence in financial matters .
in the ten years since , banks have recognized that women represent a special market , and they now offer services and advice to attract female customers .
in recent years , finance seminars for women have become common , and some banks even advertise better rates for women .
but that 's not enough , say huber and hastreiter .
it 's still much harder for women to get loans .
one of the goals of the women 's bank is to offer small loans of up to 15,000 for company start-ups or university studies .
the grameen bank in bangladesh and sewa in india have been operating in this way since the 1970s , providing microcredit to assist women in getting small projects off the ground .
the idea of a women-friendly bank is not new to germany .
a women 's bank existed in berlin in 1910 .
the first world war caused its collapse .
another bank with political objectives , the ecobank , met the same fate in june last year .
after a number of loans failed , it became insolvent and its 22,000 customers lost more than euro 2.7m.
we 'll do it our way huber was herself a member of the ecobank co-operative and lost money when it went bankrupt .
but that has n't deterred her .
the women 's bank , she says , wo n't make the same mistakes .
but it will invest in environmental funds .
profits from the bank will be invested in environmental and social projects .
huber says women are much more interested than men in investing ethically .
they own nearly eighty percent of all environmental investments .
huber says what will distinguish the women 's bank from ' ordinary ' banks is that it will cater to the needs of a particular group , rather than simply selling products .
huber and hastreiter are keen to stress that their bank is not a social service or a charity .
it will be managed by a small team , so as to keep costs down .

the spiral , according to 41-year-old entrepreneur angelika huber , is an ancient symbol of femininity .
and yet she has chosen it as the logo for a brand new project – a bank for women . there are good reasons for opening a bank just for women , according to angelika huber .
" women think differently .
women approach technology differently .
and women have a different relationship to money , " she says .
" conventional banks do n't always support the way women do business . "
huber herself is rich in business credentials .
in 1990 she founded a women 's computer school in munich .
three years ago , the school became a joint stock company and has generated over euro 1 million in income .
huber also manages a publishing house and works as a consultant .
huber and her business partner astrid hastreiter started collecting the capital needed to establish a bank in germany - € 5m .
the two women sent tens of thousands of emails seeking investment in the project .
through market analyses huber and hastreiter found they had developed a sound concept , but the women 's bank has had to be put on the backburner while they collect more funds , resolve legal problems expand their skeleton team .
and they 're off huber describes herself as someone who is more inclined to shift an appointment forward , rather than postpone it .
she has no intention of letting the project lose momentum .
this friday , the bank came one step closer to becoming a reality .
in munich , huber and hastreiter launched the women 's investment management company , where the funds will be held in trust for the bank .
" today the project moved from a political stage to an economic one , " huber said .
in a year 's time , she hopes the bank will be operating .
by 2004 , it will offer full banking services to women , including personal savings accounts .
why a women 's bank ?
a decade ago , the german consumers ' organization ' stiftung warentest ' discovered that banks were providing male customers with better service than women , because they had less trust in women 's competence in financial matters .
in the ten years since , banks have recognized that women represent a special market , and they now offer services and advice to attract female customers .
in recent years , finance seminars for women have become common , and some banks even advertise better rates for women .
but that 's not enough , say huber and hastreiter .
it 's still much harder for women to get loans .
one of the goals of the women 's bank is to offer small loans of up to 15,000 for company start-ups or university studies .
the grameen bank in bangladesh and sewa in india have been operating in this way since the 1970s , providing microcredit to assist women in getting small projects off the ground .
the idea of a women-friendly bank is not new to germany .
a women 's bank existed in berlin in 1910 .
the first world war caused its collapse .
another bank with political objectives , the ecobank , met the same fate in june last year .
after a number of loans failed , it became insolvent and its 22,000 customers lost more than euro 2.7m.
we 'll do it our way huber was herself a member of the ecobank co-operative and lost money when it went bankrupt .
but that has n't deterred her .
the women 's bank , she says , wo n't make the same mistakes .
but it will invest in environmental funds .
profits from the bank will be invested in environmental and social projects .
huber says women are much more interested than men in investing ethically .
they own nearly eighty percent of all environmental investments .
huber says what will distinguish the women 's bank from ' ordinary ' banks is that it will cater to the needs of a particular group , rather than simply selling products .
huber and hastreiter are keen to stress that their bank is not a social service or a charity .
it will be managed by a small team , so as to keep costs down .
the offices will be based in munich , but services will only be offered online .
huber says the women 's bank is intended to be woman-friendly , not hostile to men .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2002 kirch media set to be pared down to the core großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite dishes of kirch media group 's tv channels handelsblatt has learned that administrators see a dramatically streamlined kirch media holding group emerging from its insolvency process . advisers have recommended that the company succeeding the insolvent kirch media holding group should essentially be pared down to its original core business of film rights trading plus its majority stake in listed television group pro sieben sat 1 media ag , handelsblatt has learned .
the advisers presented a restructuring proposal earlier in the week to the group 's two top executives , wolfgang van betteray and hans-joachim ziems , as well as provisional insolvency administrator michael jaffé .
the plan provides for the cession of 66 % of the group 's activities , measured in terms of their capacity for revenue generation , in film and television production .
only the most high-earning entertainment production units are to be retained , according to the plan , while the units that are to be disposed of include ndf neue deutsche , production firm plazamediafilmgesellschaft and sport channel dsf .
van betteray , ziems and jaffé are under time pressure to agree on a restructuring plan .
they have two weeks at the most before insolvency proceedings are set to be opened .
when this happens , a rescue company - or more than one rescue companies - will be set up to absorb the businesses that are seen to be worth keeping .
the remaining businesses will be sold off individually .
under one proposal that 's under consideration , a separate rescue company is to be set up purely for kirch media 's activities in sports rights trading , the area in which the group had been most expansive in its last months before insolvency .
consideration is being given to the idea of paring down the sports rights business to the profitable big events such as the soccer world cup or the olympic games .
investment bank ubs warburg has been charged with the task of finding a buyer for the rescue company or companies , and it has reportedly received 55 offers .
the parties that have expressed interest include big hollywood studios , financial investors and european media groups .
the selection process is set to get underway at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's film library -lrb- ap photo / ho / kirchmedia -rrb- one major obstacle to an agreement is likely to be the differences between kirch media 's own estimates of the value of founder leo kirch 's massive film rights library and potential buyers ' estimates of its worth .
in the last available kirch media balance sheet , the library 's value is recorded as around 3 billion euro .
" the value is likely to be cut massively , " according to people close to the negotiations .
according to reports , only one third to a half of the film rights have any real worth at all .
if the library fails to fetch a good price , it will come as a blow to kirch media 's creditor-banks , since the group used the library as collateral against its loans .
in a separate development on thursday , the regional court in munich ruled that the kirch group media conglomerate - of which kirch media is a part - can retain control of its 40 % stake in europe 's largest newspaper publishing house , axel springer verlag , until august 30 .
but if the media group fails to repay its loan of 720 million euro to deutsche bank by that date , it must not challenge the bank 's right to seize the stake .
at the start of this year , deutsche 's chief executive , rolf breuer , publicly cast doubt on kirch group 's creditworthiness .
kirch 's lawyers , peter gauweiler and wolf-rüdiger bub , argued that this statement had affected the group 's reputation , and thereby hastened its demise .
thursday 's ruling suggests that the court was not totally unreceptive to this line of argument .
the ruling means that deutsche will not , for now , be able to go ahead with plans to float the springer shares on the stock market after the summer recess .
on wednesday , it was revealed that the plan had received the blessing of three banks who hold the right of veto : bayerische landesbank -lrb- bayernlb -rrb- , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
kirch used the springer stake as collateral against deutsche 's loan but also against a loan of 1.6 billion euro issued by bayernlb , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
in this connection , it has become customary to refer to this group of three banks as the formula one banks , because the loan was used to buy kirch 's stake in the formula one racing tournament .
deutsche was granted first right to the springer shares , giving it the right to dispose of the shares if , as happened , kirch failed to service its debt .
but the formula one banks were granted second right , giving them the power to veto any plans deutsche puts forward for the shares .
furthermore , they also have the right to take in any funds raised over and and above the sum that deutsche is owed .
banking insiders were expecting an excess of around 50 million euro , since the share issue was expected to rake in almost 800 million euro - a sum that would almost certainly have made it germany 's largest public offering by far this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 06.06.02 © economy .

the advisers presented a restructuring proposal earlier in the week to the group 's two top executives , wolfgang van betteray and hans-joachim ziems , as well as provisional insolvency administrator michael jaffé .
the plan provides for the cession of 66 % of the group 's activities , measured in terms of their capacity for revenue generation , in film and television production .
only the most high-earning entertainment production units are to be retained , according to the plan , while the units that are to be disposed of include ndf neue deutsche , production firm plazamediafilmgesellschaft and sport channel dsf .
van betteray , ziems and jaffé are under time pressure to agree on a restructuring plan .
they have two weeks at the most before insolvency proceedings are set to be opened .
when this happens , a rescue company - or more than one rescue companies - will be set up to absorb the businesses that are seen to be worth keeping .
the remaining businesses will be sold off individually .
under one proposal that 's under consideration , a separate rescue company is to be set up purely for kirch media 's activities in sports rights trading , the area in which the group had been most expansive in its last months before insolvency .
consideration is being given to the idea of paring down the sports rights business to the profitable big events such as the soccer world cup or the olympic games .
investment bank ubs warburg has been charged with the task of finding a buyer for the rescue company or companies , and it has reportedly received 55 offers .
the parties that have expressed interest include big hollywood studios , financial investors and european media groups .
the selection process is set to get underway at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's film library -lrb- ap photo / ho / kirchmedia -rrb- one major obstacle to an agreement is likely to be the differences between kirch media 's own estimates of the value of founder leo kirch 's massive film rights library and potential buyers ' estimates of its worth .
in the last available kirch media balance sheet , the library 's value is recorded as around 3 billion euro .
" the value is likely to be cut massively , " according to people close to the negotiations .
according to reports , only one third to a half of the film rights have any real worth at all .
if the library fails to fetch a good price , it will come as a blow to kirch media 's creditor-banks , since the group used the library as collateral against its loans .
in a separate development on thursday , the regional court in munich ruled that the kirch group media conglomerate - of which kirch media is a part - can retain control of its 40 % stake in europe 's largest newspaper publishing house , axel springer verlag , until august 30 .
but if the media group fails to repay its loan of 720 million euro to deutsche bank by that date , it must not challenge the bank 's right to seize the stake .
at the start of this year , deutsche 's chief executive , rolf breuer , publicly cast doubt on kirch group 's creditworthiness .
kirch 's lawyers , peter gauweiler and wolf-rüdiger bub , argued that this statement had affected the group 's reputation , and thereby hastened its demise .
thursday 's ruling suggests that the court was not totally unreceptive to this line of argument .
the ruling means that deutsche will not , for now , be able to go ahead with plans to float the springer shares on the stock market after the summer recess .
on wednesday , it was revealed that the plan had received the blessing of three banks who hold the right of veto : bayerische landesbank -lrb- bayernlb -rrb- , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
kirch used the springer stake as collateral against deutsche 's loan but also against a loan of 1.6 billion euro issued by bayernlb , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
in this connection , it has become customary to refer to this group of three banks as the formula one banks , because the loan was used to buy kirch 's stake in the formula one racing tournament .
deutsche was granted first right to the springer shares , giving it the right to dispose of the shares if , as happened , kirch failed to service its debt .
but the formula one banks were granted second right , giving them the power to veto any plans deutsche puts forward for the shares .
furthermore , they also have the right to take in any funds raised over and and above the sum that deutsche is owed .
banking insiders were expecting an excess of around 50 million euro , since the share issue was expected to rake in almost 800 million euro - a sum that would almost certainly have made it germany 's largest public offering by far this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 06.06.02 © economy .

the swedish parliament passed a law this week giving gay- and lesbian couples the same rights as heterosexuals to adopt children . sweden this week became the first country in europe to allow same-sex couples to adopt children from abroad .
denmark , iceland and the netherlands allow homosexual couples limited rights to adoption .
in sweden , gays and lesbians living in registered partnerships will now able to adopt their partner 's biological children .
the ' ayes ' ..
tasso stafilidis , a member of the swedish parliament , began campaigning in 1997 to change the law preventing same-sex couples from adopting international children or raising children of their own .
in 1999-2000 , an inquiry into adoption and parenting by same-sex couples found that gays and lesbians made just as good parents as heterosexuals .
the vote this week was overwhelmingly in favour of the law to grant equal rights to same-sex couples .
tasso stafilidis , who is openly gay , told dw-world that the result shows swedish parliamentarians , as well as the wider public , are well-informed about homosexuality .
" they know that it 's not anything special to be homosexual . "
but stafilidis says swedes have less understanding of same-sex parenting .
" when they do n't have knowledge , they ca n't be open-minded or have a good attitude , " he says . .. and the ' nays ' despite being passed by a convincing majority this week , the law has faced opposition within the swedish parliament .
two parties , the conservative party and the christian democrats , voted against the bill .
christian groups have joined right-wing politicians in opposing the law .
they say that adopted children are vulnerable and should not be exposed to additional stress that could result from growing up in an unconventional family environment .
some still more equal than others the law means that all swedish couples can legally adopt in future , it does not have retrospective effect .
the many adopted children already living with same-sex couples will not automatically become legal .
the battle is n't quite over for same-sex couples in sweden hoping to adopt .
very few swedish children are put up for adoption , which means couples must look abroad .
in a survey of seventeen countries conducted by the swedish foreign ministry , all said they would refuse homosexuals as adoptive parents .
but then , if sweden had been asked that question a fortnight ago , it would have given the same response .

the spiral , according to 41-year-old entrepreneur angelika huber , is an ancient symbol of femininity .
and yet she has chosen it as the logo for a brand new project – a bank for women . there are good reasons for opening a bank just for women , according to angelika huber .
" women think differently .
women approach technology differently .
and women have a different relationship to money , " she says .
" conventional banks do n't always support the way women do business . "
huber herself is rich in business credentials .
in 1990 she founded a women 's computer school in munich .
three years ago , the school became a joint stock company and has generated over euro 1 million in income .
huber also manages a publishing house and works as a consultant .
huber and her business partner astrid hastreiter started collecting the capital needed to establish a bank in germany - € 5m .
the two women sent tens of thousands of emails seeking investment in the project .
through market analyses huber and hastreiter found they had developed a sound concept , but the women 's bank has had to be put on the backburner while they collect more funds , resolve legal problems expand their skeleton team .
and they 're off huber describes herself as someone who is more inclined to shift an appointment forward , rather than postpone it .
she has no intention of letting the project lose momentum .
this friday , the bank came one step closer to becoming a reality .
in munich , huber and hastreiter launched the women 's investment management company , where the funds will be held in trust for the bank .
" today the project moved from a political stage to an economic one , " huber said .
in a year 's time , she hopes the bank will be operating .
by 2004 , it will offer full banking services to women , including personal savings accounts .
why a women 's bank ?
a decade ago , the german consumers ' organization ' stiftung warentest ' discovered that banks were providing male customers with better service than women , because they had less trust in women 's competence in financial matters .
in the ten years since , banks have recognized that women represent a special market , and they now offer services and advice to attract female customers .
in recent years , finance seminars for women have become common , and some banks even advertise better rates for women .
but that 's not enough , say huber and hastreiter .
it 's still much harder for women to get loans .
one of the goals of the women 's bank is to offer small loans of up to 15,000 for company start-ups or university studies .
the grameen bank in bangladesh and sewa in india have been operating in this way since the 1970s , providing microcredit to assist women in getting small projects off the ground .
the idea of a women-friendly bank is not new to germany .
a women 's bank existed in berlin in 1910 .
the first world war caused its collapse .
another bank with political objectives , the ecobank , met the same fate in june last year .
after a number of loans failed , it became insolvent and its 22,000 customers lost more than euro 2.7m.
we 'll do it our way huber was herself a member of the ecobank co-operative and lost money when it went bankrupt .
but that has n't deterred her .
the women 's bank , she says , wo n't make the same mistakes .
but it will invest in environmental funds .
profits from the bank will be invested in environmental and social projects .
huber says women are much more interested than men in investing ethically .
they own nearly eighty percent of all environmental investments .
huber says what will distinguish the women 's bank from ' ordinary ' banks is that it will cater to the needs of a particular group , rather than simply selling products .
huber and hastreiter are keen to stress that their bank is not a social service or a charity .
it will be managed by a small team , so as to keep costs down .
the offices will be based in munich , but services will only be offered online .
huber says the women 's bank is intended to be woman-friendly , not hostile to men .
and yes , men will be able to use its services , if they 're willing to take the risk ! send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the women 's bank the home page of the women 's bank -lrb- in german -rrb- german banks online general information from the association of german banks -lrb- in english -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on wednesday , it was revealed that the plan had received the blessing of three banks who hold the right of veto : bayerische landesbank -lrb- bayernlb -rrb- , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
kirch used the springer stake as collateral against deutsche 's loan but also against a loan of 1.6 billion euro issued by bayernlb , lehman brothers and jp morgan chase .
in this connection , it has become customary to refer to this group of three banks as the formula one banks , because the loan was used to buy kirch 's stake in the formula one racing tournament .
deutsche was granted first right to the springer shares , giving it the right to dispose of the shares if , as happened , kirch failed to service its debt .
but the formula one banks were granted second right , giving them the power to veto any plans deutsche puts forward for the shares .
furthermore , they also have the right to take in any funds raised over and and above the sum that deutsche is owed .
banking insiders were expecting an excess of around 50 million euro , since the share issue was expected to rake in almost 800 million euro - a sum that would almost certainly have made it germany 's largest public offering by far this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 06.06.02 © economy .

the advisers presented a restructuring proposal earlier in the week to the group 's two top executives , wolfgang van betteray and hans-joachim ziems , as well as provisional insolvency administrator michael jaffé .
the plan provides for the cession of 66 % of the group 's activities , measured in terms of their capacity for revenue generation , in film and television production .
only the most high-earning entertainment production units are to be retained , according to the plan , while the units that are to be disposed of include ndf neue deutsche , production firm plazamediafilmgesellschaft and sport channel dsf .
van betteray , ziems and jaffé are under time pressure to agree on a restructuring plan .
they have two weeks at the most before insolvency proceedings are set to be opened .
when this happens , a rescue company - or more than one rescue companies - will be set up to absorb the businesses that are seen to be worth keeping .
the remaining businesses will be sold off individually .
under one proposal that 's under consideration , a separate rescue company is to be set up purely for kirch media 's activities in sports rights trading , the area in which the group had been most expansive in its last months before insolvency .
consideration is being given to the idea of paring down the sports rights business to the profitable big events such as the soccer world cup or the olympic games .
investment bank ubs warburg has been charged with the task of finding a buyer for the rescue company or companies , and it has reportedly received 55 offers .
the parties that have expressed interest include big hollywood studios , financial investors and european media groups .
the selection process is set to get underway at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's film library -lrb- ap photo / ho / kirchmedia -rrb- one major obstacle to an agreement is likely to be the differences between kirch media 's own estimates of the value of founder leo kirch 's massive film rights library and potential buyers ' estimates of its worth .
in the last available kirch media balance sheet , the library 's value is recorded as around 3 billion euro .
" the value is likely to be cut massively , " according to people close to the negotiations .
according to reports , only one third to a half of the film rights have any real worth at all .
if the library fails to fetch a good price , it will come as a blow to kirch media 's creditor-banks , since the group used the library as collateral against its loans .
in a separate development on thursday , the regional court in munich ruled that the kirch group media conglomerate - of which kirch media is a part - can retain control of its 40 % stake in europe 's largest newspaper publishing house , axel springer verlag , until august 30 .
but if the media group fails to repay its loan of 720 million euro to deutsche bank by that date , it must not challenge the bank 's right to seize the stake .
at the start of this year , deutsche 's chief executive , rolf breuer , publicly cast doubt on kirch group 's creditworthiness .
kirch 's lawyers , peter gauweiler and wolf-rüdiger bub , argued that this statement had affected the group 's reputation , and thereby hastened its demise .
thursday 's ruling suggests that the court was not totally unreceptive to this line of argument .
the ruling means that deutsche will not , for now , be able to go ahead with plans to float the springer shares on the stock market after the summer recess .

just two decades earlier , nazi officials had purged german museums of art they considered " degenerate , " including works by marc chagall , max ernst , käthe kollwitz , paul klee and wassily kandinsky .
many of these same artists – ernst , klee and kandinsky among them – were represented at the first documenta as bode worked to make good on the decades of destruction .
nearly half a century later , documenta 11 is set to open june 8 in kassel .
the art fair is staged every five years and is a major date in the european art calendar , rivalling venice 's biennale .
this time there will be five exhibition venues in town and works by more than 100 artists from around the world will be on display .
for the first time , documenta will use an industrial building – a former brewery – for the show , essentially doubling the exhibition space and making it one of europe ’ s largest art shows .
international platforms indeed this year 's artistic director of documenta 11 , nigerian-born okwui enwezor -lrb- photo -rrb- , set out to make it into an international event by staging a series of so-called platforms on different continents in the year leading up to the kassel show .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intention of these platfroms , according to statement from documenta officials , was " to bring the important artistic field to which documenta 11 belongs in dialogue with other fields and cities . "
the platforms were grouped according to theme : " democracy unrealized " in vienna and berlin ; " experiments with truth : transitional justice and the processes of truth and reconciliation " in new delhi ; " créolité and creolization " in st. lucia , and " under siege : four african cities " in freetown , johannesburg , kinshasa and lagos .
art in a social context in kassel , meanwhile , the show will include a broad spectrum of artists who are dealing with social problems in different parts of the world .
" where an artist comes from should not come into question , " said enwezor , a poet , critic and curator who is the publisher and founding editor of " nka : journal of contemporary african art , " which is co-published with the african studies center at cornell university .
chilean artist alfredo jaar , whose work deals with the situation on the border between the united states and mexico , is one of the artists included in the show .
new yorker lorna simpson , who deals with race discrimination , and belgian artist luc tuymans , who addresses issues of the colonial history of the congo , are also included .
multimedia performance on june 8 and june 9 , the theater-performance " confessions of zeno " by participating artist william kentridge will take place at the staatstheater kassel .

just two decades earlier , nazi officials had purged german museums of art they considered " degenerate , " including works by marc chagall , max ernst , käthe kollwitz , paul klee and wassily kandinsky .
many of these same artists – ernst , klee and kandinsky among them – were represented at the first documenta as bode worked to make good on the decades of destruction .
nearly half a century later , documenta 11 is set to open june 8 in kassel .
the art fair is staged every five years and is a major date in the european art calendar , rivalling venice 's biennale .
this time there will be five exhibition venues in town and works by more than 100 artists from around the world will be on display .
for the first time , documenta will use an industrial building – a former brewery – for the show , essentially doubling the exhibition space and making it one of europe ’ s largest art shows .
international platforms indeed this year 's artistic director of documenta 11 , nigerian-born okwui enwezor -lrb- photo -rrb- , set out to make it into an international event by staging a series of so-called platforms on different continents in the year leading up to the kassel show .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intention of these platfroms , according to statement from documenta officials , was " to bring the important artistic field to which documenta 11 belongs in dialogue with other fields and cities . "
the platforms were grouped according to theme : " democracy unrealized " in vienna and berlin ; " experiments with truth : transitional justice and the processes of truth and reconciliation " in new delhi ; " créolité and creolization " in st. lucia , and " under siege : four african cities " in freetown , johannesburg , kinshasa and lagos .
art in a social context in kassel , meanwhile , the show will include a broad spectrum of artists who are dealing with social problems in different parts of the world .
" where an artist comes from should not come into question , " said enwezor , a poet , critic and curator who is the publisher and founding editor of " nka : journal of contemporary african art , " which is co-published with the african studies center at cornell university .
chilean artist alfredo jaar , whose work deals with the situation on the border between the united states and mexico , is one of the artists included in the show .
new yorker lorna simpson , who deals with race discrimination , and belgian artist luc tuymans , who addresses issues of the colonial history of the congo , are also included .

just two decades earlier , nazi officials had purged german museums of art they considered " degenerate , " including works by marc chagall , max ernst , käthe kollwitz , paul klee and wassily kandinsky .
many of these same artists – ernst , klee and kandinsky among them – were represented at the first documenta as bode worked to make good on the decades of destruction .
nearly half a century later , documenta 11 is set to open june 8 in kassel .
the art fair is staged every five years and is a major date in the european art calendar , rivalling venice 's biennale .
this time there will be five exhibition venues in town and works by more than 100 artists from around the world will be on display .
for the first time , documenta will use an industrial building – a former brewery – for the show , essentially doubling the exhibition space and making it one of europe ’ s largest art shows .
international platforms indeed this year 's artistic director of documenta 11 , nigerian-born okwui enwezor -lrb- photo -rrb- , set out to make it into an international event by staging a series of so-called platforms on different continents in the year leading up to the kassel show .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intention of these platfroms , according to statement from documenta officials , was " to bring the important artistic field to which documenta 11 belongs in dialogue with other fields and cities . "
the platforms were grouped according to theme : " democracy unrealized " in vienna and berlin ; " experiments with truth : transitional justice and the processes of truth and reconciliation " in new delhi ; " créolité and creolization " in st. lucia , and " under siege : four african cities " in freetown , johannesburg , kinshasa and lagos .
art in a social context in kassel , meanwhile , the show will include a broad spectrum of artists who are dealing with social problems in different parts of the world .
" where an artist comes from should not come into question , " said enwezor , a poet , critic and curator who is the publisher and founding editor of " nka : journal of contemporary african art , " which is co-published with the african studies center at cornell university .
chilean artist alfredo jaar , whose work deals with the situation on the border between the united states and mexico , is one of the artists included in the show .
new yorker lorna simpson , who deals with race discrimination , and belgian artist luc tuymans , who addresses issues of the colonial history of the congo , are also included .
multimedia performance on june 8 and june 9 , the theater-performance " confessions of zeno " by participating artist william kentridge will take place at the staatstheater kassel .
based on italo svevo ’ s novel la coscienza di zeno , the multimedia theater production uses puppetry , song , acting , music and video to explore experiences of labor and erotic pleasures of the european bourgeoisie prior to world war i. documenta 10 , held in 1997 , attracted a record 631,000 visitors and exhibition organizers are already warning about traffic jams and sold-out hotels during the first weeks of the show .

the swedish parliament passed a law this week giving gay- and lesbian couples the same rights as heterosexuals to adopt children . sweden this week became the first country in europe to allow same-sex couples to adopt children from abroad .
denmark , iceland and the netherlands allow homosexual couples limited rights to adoption .
in sweden , gays and lesbians living in registered partnerships will now able to adopt their partner 's biological children .
the ' ayes ' ..
tasso stafilidis , a member of the swedish parliament , began campaigning in 1997 to change the law preventing same-sex couples from adopting international children or raising children of their own .
in 1999-2000 , an inquiry into adoption and parenting by same-sex couples found that gays and lesbians made just as good parents as heterosexuals .
the vote this week was overwhelmingly in favour of the law to grant equal rights to same-sex couples .
tasso stafilidis , who is openly gay , told dw-world that the result shows swedish parliamentarians , as well as the wider public , are well-informed about homosexuality .
" they know that it 's not anything special to be homosexual . "
but stafilidis says swedes have less understanding of same-sex parenting .
" when they do n't have knowledge , they ca n't be open-minded or have a good attitude , " he says . .. and the ' nays ' despite being passed by a convincing majority this week , the law has faced opposition within the swedish parliament .
two parties , the conservative party and the christian democrats , voted against the bill .
christian groups have joined right-wing politicians in opposing the law .
they say that adopted children are vulnerable and should not be exposed to additional stress that could result from growing up in an unconventional family environment .
some still more equal than others the law means that all swedish couples can legally adopt in future , it does not have retrospective effect .
the many adopted children already living with same-sex couples will not automatically become legal .
the battle is n't quite over for same-sex couples in sweden hoping to adopt .
very few swedish children are put up for adoption , which means couples must look abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe in transition romania — still a long way to go poland 's limp into the eu the czech republic - a bumpy ride into the eu lithuania 's search for security current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2002 estonia needs more than a good show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain aspects of capitalist lifestyle have already hit estonia .
although estonia shone brightly during the eurovision song contest last may , it still has some tough hurdles to tackle before it can bask in the glow of the eu . when estonia won the eurovision song contest last year , former prime minister mart laar said that estonia didn ‘ t need to knock at the door of europe .
he said the country would break in singing .
in may 2002 , estonia became the first among eu candidate countries to host the glitzy eurovision song contest .
the event gave the small baltic nation an opportunity not shared by its counterparts - a chance to shine on the european stage .
thousands of international guests attended the contest in the medieval capital of tallinn where they got to experience first-hand a segment of estonia .
in addition , extensive media coverage also gave millions of europeans an introduction into their soon-to-be neighbor .
for many sitting back home in front of their television sets , this was the first time they saw images of their future eu partner .
and the question for many remains , can estonia offer more to europe than a stunning musical spectacle ?
political support for accession estonian prime minister siim kallas , who took up office in january , has promised to bring the decade-long drive to win eu and nato membership to a successful end this year .
" we are expected to bring these processes to a conclusion , " said kallas at his swearing-in ceremony .
" and let me promise you here that all necessary decisions will be taken , with responsibility and with competence . "
but estonia still faces difficult negotiations with brussels .
it has closed only 24 of the 31 negotiating " chapters " , or policy areas , required by the eu .
one crucial point is the country ’ s energy sector , in particular the country ’ s prime mineral resource , oil shale .
it makes estonia ’ s energy system independent from neighboring countries , and for political reasons it does not want to give that up .
the eu , however , is concerned about the environmental impact of this fuel .
burning massive quantities of oil shale has severely increased the pollution of the atmosphere , land and groundwater .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers aboard a senna sealink ferry travelling from dover , england to calais , france search for duty free .
another issue in dispute is taxation .
the eu abolished duty-free purchases from july 1 , 1999 .
since then , estonia has become a tax-free haven for northern europeans , in particular .
many scandinavians take up offers for short jaunts to tallinn by ship to benefit from travel to a duty-free region - and duty-free bargains onboard .
with accession to the eu , estonia would have to end its duty-free policies .
this would have negative implications for this sector .
estonia is asking for a transitional period for retaining duty-free sales .
according to the estonian ministry of foreign affairs , the country hopes to reach agreement in the areas of taxation and energy by the end of the spanish eu presidency on june 30 , 2002 .
public opinion improving the estonian poll firm emor has registered a rise in " euro-optimists " over the past six months .
a recent survey showed that 59 % of estonian citizens support eu accession .
35 % don ’ t support or object to the move .
emor ’ s division manager , aivar voog , says that the attitude towards eu accession depended greatly on the self-esteem of estonian people .
" the more self-confident the people are , the more boldly they make decisions towards changes , " he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanel padar from estonia , the winner of the 2001 eurovision song contest , holds his trophy and his country 's flag as he celebrates his victory in copenhagen , denmark , saturday , may 12 , 2001 .
tanel padar and dave benton , a native of the caribbean island of aruba , entertained 38,000 fans with their swinging " everybody . "
-lrb- ap photo / alastair grant -rrb- a general improvement in attitude has made the population more optimistic on eu accession .
voog says the eurovision song contest has had a positive effect on the " euro-support " curve -lrb- photo : last year 's winner , estonia 's tanel padar -rrb- .
but the european commission ‘ s eurobarometer says personal opinion is much lower .
" in estonia , we registered extremely low optimism regarding expected personal advantages from future eu membership , " the commission discovered .
only one in four respondents think that they would personally benefit from accession .
this makes estonians the least optimistic among the candidate countries .
cultural fears many people also see european integration as a potential threat to estonian culture and identity .
this is primarily due to the country ’ s historical ties to russia .
since its independence in 1991 , estonia has reoriented trade away from russian markets to eu member states .

he said the country would break in singing .
in may 2002 , estonia became the first among eu candidate countries to host the glitzy eurovision song contest .

political support for accession estonian prime minister siim kallas , who took up office in january , has promised to bring the decade-long drive to win eu and nato membership to a successful end this year .
" we are expected to bring these processes to a conclusion , " said kallas at his swearing-in ceremony .

it has closed only 24 of the 31 negotiating " chapters " , or policy areas , required by the eu .
one crucial point is the country ’ s energy sector , in particular the country ’ s prime mineral resource , oil shale .
it makes estonia ’ s energy system independent from neighboring countries , and for political reasons it does not want to give that up .
the eu , however , is concerned about the environmental impact of this fuel .
burning massive quantities of oil shale has severely increased the pollution of the atmosphere , land and groundwater .

since then , estonia has become a tax-free haven for northern europeans , in particular .
many scandinavians take up offers for short jaunts to tallinn by ship to benefit from travel to a duty-free region - and duty-free bargains onboard .
with accession to the eu , estonia would have to end its duty-free policies .

estonia is asking for a transitional period for retaining duty-free sales .
according to the estonian ministry of foreign affairs , the country hopes to reach agreement in the areas of taxation and energy by the end of the spanish eu presidency on june 30 , 2002 .

just two decades earlier , nazi officials had purged german museums of art they considered " degenerate , " including works by marc chagall , max ernst , käthe kollwitz , paul klee and wassily kandinsky .
many of these same artists – ernst , klee and kandinsky among them – were represented at the first documenta as bode worked to make good on the decades of destruction .
nearly half a century later , documenta 11 is set to open june 8 in kassel .
the art fair is staged every five years and is a major date in the european art calendar , rivalling venice 's biennale .
this time there will be five exhibition venues in town and works by more than 100 artists from around the world will be on display .
for the first time , documenta will use an industrial building – a former brewery – for the show , essentially doubling the exhibition space and making it one of europe ’ s largest art shows .
international platforms indeed this year 's artistic director of documenta 11 , nigerian-born okwui enwezor -lrb- photo -rrb- , set out to make it into an international event by staging a series of so-called platforms on different continents in the year leading up to the kassel show .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intention of these platfroms , according to statement from documenta officials , was " to bring the important artistic field to which documenta 11 belongs in dialogue with other fields and cities . "
the platforms were grouped according to theme : " democracy unrealized " in vienna and berlin ; " experiments with truth : transitional justice and the processes of truth and reconciliation " in new delhi ; " créolité and creolization " in st. lucia , and " under siege : four african cities " in freetown , johannesburg , kinshasa and lagos .
art in a social context in kassel , meanwhile , the show will include a broad spectrum of artists who are dealing with social problems in different parts of the world .
" where an artist comes from should not come into question , " said enwezor , a poet , critic and curator who is the publisher and founding editor of " nka : journal of contemporary african art , " which is co-published with the african studies center at cornell university .
chilean artist alfredo jaar , whose work deals with the situation on the border between the united states and mexico , is one of the artists included in the show .
new yorker lorna simpson , who deals with race discrimination , and belgian artist luc tuymans , who addresses issues of the colonial history of the congo , are also included .
multimedia performance on june 8 and june 9 , the theater-performance " confessions of zeno " by participating artist william kentridge will take place at the staatstheater kassel .
based on italo svevo ’ s novel la coscienza di zeno , the multimedia theater production uses puppetry , song , acting , music and video to explore experiences of labor and erotic pleasures of the european bourgeoisie prior to world war i. documenta 10 , held in 1997 , attracted a record 631,000 visitors and exhibition organizers are already warning about traffic jams and sold-out hotels during the first weeks of the show .
