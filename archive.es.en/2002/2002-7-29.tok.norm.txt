kpmg 's " fraud barometer " shows the value of reported cases increasing from £ 379,000 to £ 2.9m.
the firm said that the level of reported fraud cases north of the border seemed to be increasing at a faster rate than in the uk as a whole .
but it said that the overall level of fraud in scotland remained well below the national average .
fraud is very much in the public 's mind at present and it would appear that companies are not as willing to cover up any wrongdoing robin crawford kpmg kpmg 's " fraud barometer " considers major cases being heard in britain where the charges are over £ 100,000 .
according to figures for the first six months of this year , there was a sevenfold increase in the value of reported fraud cases in scotland , from £ 379,000 last year to £ 2.9m.
this compared to a 250 % increase across the uk - from £ 111m to £ 255.4m.
robin crawford , partner in kpmg forensic , said this was a worrying trend , which had been evident for the past five years .
" first , the statistics again seem to demonstrate that the level of reported fraud is increasing at a faster rate in scotland than in the uk as a whole , " he said .
" secondly , the average value of each reported case has shown a dramatic increase over the last couple of years . "
kpmg expects the trend to continue according to kpmg , the largest increases in the value of fraud across britain were in the banking and public sectors .
the six-month figure for banking fraud increased from £ 11.3m on 31 december 2000 to £ 51.8m by the end of june this year .
over the same period the firm recorded a 330 % increase in the value of reported fraud in the public sector .
mr crawford said " huge rises " in the total value of fraud had been reported in every region of the uk .
" as tough economic trading conditions continue , we expect this trend to continue , " he said .
" fraud is very much in the public 's mind at present and it would appear that companies are not as willing to cover up any wrongdoing but instead are actively taking advantage of both criminal and civil remedies . "
the latest figures also show that the majority of frauds were committed by external third parties .

mr crawford said " huge rises " in the total value of fraud had been reported in every region of the uk .
" as tough economic trading conditions continue , we expect this trend to continue , " he said .
" fraud is very much in the public 's mind at present and it would appear that companies are not as willing to cover up any wrongdoing but instead are actively taking advantage of both criminal and civil remedies . "
the latest figures also show that the majority of frauds were committed by external third parties .
mr crawford said this underlined the need for all firms to " make rigorous checks " on the people they do business with .

the chartered institute of personnel and development says sickness costs businesses an annual average of £ 520 for each employee .
while the nation 's health is not deteriorating , the survey found that uk workers were taking more sick leave , clocking up an average 10 days a year .
the institute questioned more than 1,300 organisations about why employees went sick and how much it cost businesses .
costly leave stress was found to be the leading cause of long-term illness among white collar staff .
manual workers were more likely to cite back pain as the number one reason for sick leave lasting more than four weeks .
the findings are higher than those in a survey carried out by the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- .
the cbi research estimated that the cost to uk firms was around £ 12bn in 2001 , up £ 1bn on the previous year .
the survey also calculated that uk workers took an average of seven days off a year .

the new policy institute said a third of all welsh children are living in poverty .
the institute said labour governments in both cardiff and westminster need to double their efforts if they are to achieve their target of eliminating child poverty in 20 years ' time .
youth unemployment at 14 % runs higher than any other part of the uk , except merseyside .
the welsh assembly is spending £ 83m over three years on communities first , a plan to tackle deprivation .
but that is all the administration can do under its devolution settlement with the uk government at london .
as part of a week-long examination at poverty levels , bbc wales asked the new policy institute to examine statistics available on the extent of poverty and social exclusion .
700,000 people live below the uk government 's low-income threshold -lrb- £ 225 for a couple with two children , after tax -rrb- .
250,000 children live in households below that poverty threshold .
those numbers have come down by about 10 % since labour took power in 1997 .
in europe , only greece has more people below the poverty threshold .
children 's commissioner for wales has echoed the report 's call for a devolved poverty strategy .
" many children report they feel stigmatised by the school meals system and get bullied by peers , " he said .
" for families with little money coming in , it all adds pressure .
" this government ' pledges to eradicate poverty is vital , but we need to work to ensure that happens within a generation .
" the report shows things have got better by 10 to 15 % in period when they should got become better by 20 % .
" we do need to really target those areas of the country where there are high areas of poverty - the south wales valleys and poorer rural locations .
" there is a limit to what the assembly can do .
all they can do is use the welsh office to bring pressure to bare on the westminster government . "
as assembly spokesperson said it was trying to help through initiatives like objective one ; communities first ; and better advice , better health , a £ 3m project which puts citizens advice bureau staff in doctors ' surgeries .
