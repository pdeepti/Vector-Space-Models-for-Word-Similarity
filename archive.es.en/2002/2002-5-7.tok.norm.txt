many of the one million people who took to the streets of france last week to denounce the success of far-right leader jean-marie le pen were young people .
for many , it was their first ever demonstration .
to test out this newly politicised youth , i decided to spend some time at the sorbonne university in paris , which has in its time been a centre of radical student activity .
" i do n't think you 're really talking to the right people - we do n't really count as young , " said leah ferreri , a law student , strolling arm-in-arm with her friend celine ogee through the leafy tranquillity of the place de la sorbonne .
leah and celine said the election had not changed them " i 'm already 23 . "
" of course there are people who have been very active in the last couple of weeks , " said celine , who is also studying law .
" but on the whole they 're those people who were political to start with - mainly the students who belong to the youth sections of the leftist parties . "
" i 'm not apolitical , and i did vote .
but i do n't see politics as something that plays a particularly important role in my life - the elections have n't changed that . "
others were more blunt .
" i 'm not interested in politics , " said economics student antonio tritta .
" i did n't take part in the protests against le pen - i could n't have anyway because i had too much work to do . "
fellow student arthur saunier was a victim of the same plight .
and their friends ?
" no one i know really cares that much , " he said .
' not enough ' abstention rates in the first round of the presidential elections were a record high in france - a country which has a history of strong political engagement .
they remained relatively high in the second , despite the vast campaign launched by both the media and the political classes to urge the french electorate to cast their ballot .
" the fact is that what 's on offer does n't inspire people that much , " said caroline mazens , a history student .
" and if students are going to get political they need something to believe in , something to get excited about .
it 's up to the politicians to come up with something . "
" whatever that is , it 's going to take more than a few anti-le pen protests , " said her boyfriend adrien minard , who took part in the may day rallies .
' what 's on offer does n't inspire people that much " " it was great to have a show against fascism and racism , and it was important that they happened , but it 's not enough in itself . "
david langlois mallet , who runs a political website , le maquis , insists however that the movement which sprung up against mr le pen will not be left floundering by the landslide defeat of its target by the conservative president , jacques chirac .
" it 's true that it 's easy to simply be against something , and fascism and le pen are in lots of ways quite simple targets .
but we 've started something here - and i 'm really hoping that the ideas can become something more sophisticated . "
" france needs real debate , and the politicians need to find new ways of engaging people in the political process - it would be great if that was the net result of a pretty disastrous set of presidential elections . "

the commons home affairs select committee has published a report endorsing the use of community support officers -lrb- csos -rrb- - but on the condition it is not compulsory for forces to adopt them . "
we do not think a case has been made out for these people to have any police powers " kevin morris police superintendents ' association the plan is for csos , with the power to detain suspects for up to half an hour , to help regular police officers with routine patrolling .
the idea is a key part of major reforms that prompted thousands of police officers to take to the streets in protest two months ago .
the mps ' report coincides with the second reading in the commons of the police reform bill , which has been defeated several times in the lords .
peers objected to the powers of detention and plans to replace detention officers in police stations with private security guards .
but the committee said : " we recognise the genuine concerns about the powers to be given to community support officers , but believe that the only way of finding out whether this proposal will work is to try it . "
whistleblowers the mps said the csos should not be given the power to conduct intimate body searches .
they also questioned the proposal to give the home secretary the power to intervene in failing forces , saying it should only be used as a last resort .
the committee advised against setting up a new policing standards unit , and called for further measures to reduce the number of police retirements on medical grounds .
it urged further reform of police disciplinary procedures and for police officers to be covered by the public disclosure of work act , which protects whistleblowers .
committee chairman chris mullin said : " no-one has seriously questioned the need for police reform .
" this bill contains many desirable measures - we have concentrated on the most controversial . "
home office minister john denham responded : " the driving force for community support officers has come from the police themselves , in particular the metropolitan police service .
" i am pleased that the committee has recognised that csos could play an important part in supporting the police and that the powers we are proposing should be tested . "
' confusion ' he said the csos would tackle low level crime and anti-social behaviour , to free up officers ' time to work the frontline .
but mr denham stressed the government 's determination to reverse efforts by the house of lords to water down csos ' powers and deprive the home secretary of the power of intervention .
the minister said : " everyone has the right to expect high standards of policing - wherever they live .
" the government remains convinced that powers to tackle persistent poor performance are required . "
case ' not made ' but police superintendents ' association president chief superintendent kevin morris thinks the csos should have more limited powers .
" we do not think a case has been made out for these people to have any police powers , " he said .
" preventative and reassurance patrols in the shape of wardens are already working and would not lead to uncertainty and confusion for the public . "
the metropolitan police has been very supportive of the cso concept and could have 500 on london 's streets by the end of the year .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- cherie 's policy role under spotlight categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk politics front page world uk uk politics interviews business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 7 may , 2002 , 05:14 gmt 06:14 uk cherie 's policy role under spotlight cherie blair : " a hillary clinton-type role " downing street has defended cherie blair 's role in chairing a series of policy seminars at number 10 .
opposition parties voiced concerns over the role for mrs blair - accusing her of adopting a " hillary clinton-style " role .
ms clinton , the wife of us president bill clinton , came under fire in the us from some for apparently influencing policy from her position as first lady .
as with ms clinton , mrs blair has a hugely successful career outside politics .
she has also had political ambitions of her own - having contested a seat for labour in the 1983 general election .
the role at policy seminars comes after years in which there have been considerable efforts made to avoid any impression of mrs blair having any influence on government policy .
' dating back to 1999 ' downing street confirmed that mrs blair had chaired question and answer sessions at the end of lectures , but said she did not take part in discussion .
a downing street spokesman said : " it is nonsense to suggest that mrs blair has overseen a major government transport summit .
" we are talking about a series of lectures concerning a wide range of subjects which have been hosted by the prime minister in downing street dating back to 1999 .
" these are lectures not policy-making events or meetings . "
mrs blair steps in to chair the question and answer sessions on occasions when the prime minister has to leave because of other business , the spokesman added .
' not accountable to parliament ' but shadow transport secretary theresa may said : " not content with advice from the department of transport and the policy unit , tony blair has now taken to seeking advice from non-elected individuals .
" it is a sad indictment of the government when the prime minister clearly deems his wife to be a better policy adviser than he does his secretary of state for transport . "

opposition parties voiced concerns over the role for mrs blair - accusing her of adopting a " hillary clinton-style " role .
ms clinton , the wife of us president bill clinton , came under fire in the us from some for apparently influencing policy from her position as first lady .
as with ms clinton , mrs blair has a hugely successful career outside politics .
she has also had political ambitions of her own - having contested a seat for labour in the 1983 general election .
the role at policy seminars comes after years in which there have been considerable efforts made to avoid any impression of mrs blair having any influence on government policy .
' dating back to 1999 ' downing street confirmed that mrs blair had chaired question and answer sessions at the end of lectures , but said she did not take part in discussion .
a downing street spokesman said : " it is nonsense to suggest that mrs blair has overseen a major government transport summit .
" we are talking about a series of lectures concerning a wide range of subjects which have been hosted by the prime minister in downing street dating back to 1999 .
" these are lectures not policy-making events or meetings . "
mrs blair steps in to chair the question and answer sessions on occasions when the prime minister has to leave because of other business , the spokesman added .
' not accountable to parliament ' but shadow transport secretary theresa may said : " not content with advice from the department of transport and the policy unit , tony blair has now taken to seeking advice from non-elected individuals .
" it is a sad indictment of the government when the prime minister clearly deems his wife to be a better policy adviser than he does his secretary of state for transport . "
liberal democrat norman baker said : " mrs blair seems to be adopting a hillary clinton-type role .
" it looks like another example of the prime minister having friends - in this case family - who are not accountable to parliament , stepping into policy areas . "

the call for moderation came as germany 's first major strike since the mid-1990s entered its second day .
about 20,000 workers at 22 factories walked out of electrical engineering plants in the south-western state of baden-wuerttemburg .
those walkouts followed strike action by an estimated 60,000 car manufacturing workers on monday .
pay claims criticised the most prominent onslaught came from brussels by the economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
" we have always said that the evolution of wages has to be consistent with the evolution of inflation and productivity , " mr solbes said .
economists have argued that engineering union ig metall 's wage demand could push prices higher , damage germany 's competitiveness and endanger the country 's fragile economic recovery .
" too high wage settlements show up quickly in higher unemployment and a temporary jump in inflation , " said hypovereinsbank 's thomas hueck .
copycats but the main fear in brussels is that the strike could spread , with copycat actions taken across the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- .
" if it became a widespread phenomenon in europe it would be disruptive for european growth , " the chairman of the european commission 's economic and financial committee , johnny akerholm , said .
on tuesday morning , there were early signs that this could be happening .
the services union verdi said it would push on with brief strikes ahead of pay talks and the construction union ig bau confirmed that pay talks in its sector had broken down ahead of the weekend .
miles apart following monday 's action - when an estimated 60,000 workers downed their tools in germany 's first major strike since the mid-1990s - there was little hope of a speedy resolution .
at further 25,000 workers at the very least would take industrial action by the end of the week in a series of targeted one-day actions that would hurt at least 50 predominantly small companies , ig metall warned .
ig metall boss klaus zwickel was widely quoted by german newspapers as saying its previously revised demand for a 4 % pay rise was now off .
any new talks with the employers ' union would have to be based on ig metall 's original 6.5 % demand , mr zwickel said .
the gap between the workers ' demand and the employers ' 3.3 % pay rise offer will be difficult to bridge .
" we are at the upper limit of what we can afford , " insisted the chief negotiator for the employers in the south-west region where the current strikes are taking place .
he received support from mr hueck who insisted that even 4 % would be " way too much " .
but mr zwickel remained undeterred .
" we 're not striking against -lsb- the german chancellor gerhard -rsb- schroeder or against anybody else , but to get a fair result and we 'll keep it going as long as we need , " he told striking workers . watch / listen on this story wolfgang munchau , financial times deutschland " they have switched their tactics from previous strikes - they target a different company every day " pay dispute escalates latest news builders ' strike spreads builders down tools ballot for builders initial pay deal strikes spread to berlin call for wage restraint what the papers say stuttgart on strike analysis economic thaw ?

fortuyn , 54 , was shot dead as he left a radio studio in the central dutch city of hilversum .
the maverick politician , who had been campaigning on an anti-immigration ticket , was expected to do well in general elections in nine days ' time , picking up at least 15 % of the vote .
mr kok , along with senior cabinet officials , will meet members of fortuyn 's party to see if they wish the election to go ahead .
electoral campaigning by all parties has already been halted following an emergency session of the dutch parliament .
protests on monday night scuffles broke out between police and demonstrators in front of the parliament building in the hague after protesters gathered to protest their anger over the killing of fortuyn .
around 300 people were involved in the protest , in which bottles and stones were thrown at police .
police said they had arrested a 33-year-old white dutch man in relation to the killing , but no motive has yet been established .
the bbc 's william horsley says the killing is likely to raise political tensions not only in the netherlands , but potentially in many parts of europe , where issues of immigration , race relations and nationalism - on which fortuyn was most outspoken - have come to the centre of the political debate .
pim 's policies halt immigration integrate existing immigrants re-erect dutch border controls sack 25 % of civil servants end dutch system of consensus politics " this is deeply tragic first of all for him and for all his loved ones .
it is also deeply tragic for our democracy , " mr kok said .
" in god 's name let 's keep calm .
at a time when you want to be very angry , being calm is the best way , " he said .
however , the acting prime minister 's calls went unheeded as fortuyn 's supporters brandished photos of him and screamed abuse against the political establishment .
protesters tore down barricades and threw them at police with dogs .
riot police were deployed to restore order .
international reaction politicians across europe and the united states joined in condemning the assassination .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt said he believed something like this was " impossible in this day and age , in the european union , in the 21st century " .
his british counterpart tony blair warned against violently targeting politicians , regardless of their political beliefs .
" the united states ... condemns this senseless act of violence , " said state department spokeswoman brenda greenberg .
far-right parties have also expressed strong sentiments .
bruno megret , head of france 's right-wing national republican movement -lrb- mnr -rrb- , said : " if it was politically motivated , this criminal act shows to what extent certain hysterical positions like those shown by the french left over the past 15 days can incite hatred . "
gunman ' chased ' eyewitnesses say a single gunman shot fortuyn as he got into a chauffeur-driven limousine in the media park where the radio station is located .
he was shot six times , suffering multiple wounds in the head , chest and neck , and died shortly afterwards .
television reporter dave abspoel said four people chased the gunman , who apparently fired in their direction .
but the bbc 's geraldine coughlan in the hague says it would have been difficult to gain access to the media park , where several tv and radio studios are located , without going through tight identity and security checks .
threats fortuyn provoked public indignation by calling for the netherlands ' borders to be closed to immigrants and by describing islam as a ' backward ' religion .
in an interview last week , fortuyn expressed fears that he could be the victim of an attack and said that he had received threats by phone , e-mail and letter .
a few weeks ago , protesters threw two cream pies laced with urine in his face .
but interior minister klaas de vries said that pim fortuyn had not received any threats to his safety .

"
we estimate around 650 rebels have been killed since thursday " achhyut wagle , adviser to the prime minister the attacks are concentrated on suspected rebel bases in the remote hill regions of rolpa and pyuthan where , six years ago , the insurgency is thought to have begun .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen , supported with aerial firepower from armed helicopters , continued their offensive against the maoists , after intense fighting on sunday night .
officials say these operations , launched last thursday , have dealt a severe blow by killing possibly hundreds of rebels .
some official claims have in the past proved to have been exaggerated , and with no comments being made by the maoists themselves , these figures can not be independently verified .
major victory nepal prime minister 's adviser achhyut wagle said on monday the exact casualty figures could only be known once the troops returned to their bases from the mountainous area of operation .
however , he said judging from the bodies recovered , and signs of other bodies that were " dragged away by the rebels " , a major defeat had been inflicted on the maoists .
" we estimate around 650 rebels have been killed since thursday , " he told the bbc , " of them , over 200 were killed in sunday 's operations which continued overnight . "
the defence ministry says an accurate assessment of the losses inflicted on the rebels has been hampered by difficult terrain and bad weather .
but citing circumstantial evidence , it said at least 350 rebels may have been killed in the current assaults .
nepalese newspapers say as many as 600 maoists may have been killed in what appears to be the largest single offensive against the maoists in the six years of the insurgency .
the army says its soldiers seized training manuals and food supplies from rebel bases .
human rights groups have expressed their fears for the safety of civilians in the area and have asked for access to them .
increased credibility correspondents say this reported success would strengthen prime minister sher bahadur deuba 's position in his talks with us president george bush on tuesday , and british prime minister tony blair later in the week .
mr deuba left kathmandu for the us on sunday and plans to seek both military and economic aid to crush the rebellion and rebuild nepal 's fragile economy .
during a recent visit to nepal , us secretary of state colin powell promised unspecified help to mr deuba 's government .
now , with some visible success in the campaign against the rebels , mr deuba 's plea for assistance would carry more weight in western capitals .

we estimate around 650 rebels have been killed since thursday achhyut wagle , adviser to the prime minister the attacks are concentrated on suspected rebel bases in the remote hill regions of rolpa and pyuthan where , six years ago , the insurgency is thought to have begun .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen , supported with aerial firepower from armed helicopters , continued their offensive against the maoists , after intense fighting on sunday night .
officials say these operations , launched last thursday , have dealt a severe blow by killing possibly hundreds of rebels .
some official claims have in the past proved to have been exaggerated , and with no comments being made by the maoists themselves , these figures can not be independently verified .
major victory nepal prime minister 's adviser achhyut wagle said on monday the exact casualty figures could only be known once the troops returned to their bases from the mountainous area of operation .
mr deuba 's strategy may be paying off however , he said judging from the bodies recovered , and signs of other bodies that were " dragged away by the rebels " , a major defeat had been inflicted on the maoists .
" we estimate around 650 rebels have been killed since thursday , " he told the bbc , " of them , over 200 were killed in sunday 's operations which continued overnight . "
the defence ministry says an accurate assessment of the losses inflicted on the rebels has been hampered by difficult terrain and bad weather .
but citing circumstantial evidence , it said at least 350 rebels may have been killed in the current assaults .
nepalese newspapers say as many as 600 maoists may have been killed in what appears to be the largest single offensive against the maoists in the six years of the insurgency .
the army says its soldiers seized training manuals and food supplies from rebel bases .
human rights groups have expressed their fears for the safety of civilians in the area and have asked for access to them .
increased credibility correspondents say this reported success would strengthen prime minister sher bahadur deuba 's position in his talks with us president george bush on tuesday , and british prime minister tony blair later in the week .
the conflict has claimed thousand of lives mr deuba left kathmandu for the us on sunday and plans to seek both military and economic aid to crush the rebellion and rebuild nepal 's fragile economy .
during a recent visit to nepal , us secretary of state colin powell promised unspecified help to mr deuba 's government .
now , with some visible success in the campaign against the rebels , mr deuba 's plea for assistance would carry more weight in western capitals .

" we 've been looking and working quite energetically at strengthening the framework of our relationship with japan , korea and china , " said trade minister mark vaile .
australia is driven by a mixture of disgruntlement with the workings of the global markets and the world trade organisation , and by an urge to penetrate large and growing markets like china .
" china certainly looms large in terms of one of our major trading partners , " said mr vaile .
changed focus australia will shift further away from its historic reliance on european trade when it redrafts its policies later this year .
the new policies are expected to focus more on bilateral trade agreements with individual countries .
in asia , singapore and thailand are firmly on australia 's radar , in addition to china and japan .
australia is also expected to sign a trade pact with the 10-nation association of southeast asian nations later this year .
this would improve its trading relations with the association 's member states brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam .
economic strength australia 's trade has been hit by the weak global economy which has caused its exports to fall while its imports have risen .
in contrast to many of its trading partners , australia 's economy is performing very well with economic growth of about 4 % , strong consumer spending and rising job vacancies .
consequently , many economists predicted that the reserve bank of australia would raise the interest rate when it meets on tuesday .
if the anticipated rise in the official rate from 4.25 % to 4.5 % materialises , it will be the first rate hike in australia since august 2000 .
