persistent rumours have suggested that gm has found large holes in the bankrupt korean company 's books - as much as $ 1.5bn , according to korean newspaper reports .
that , said the korean economic daily , could prompt a renegotiation , along with suspicions that price manipulation on products shipped between korean and overseas units has incurred a huge tax liability .
but gm officials indicated that the takeover is still on course , with completion expected in about six weeks .
and a daewoo spokesman said the reports were " exaggerated " .
" issues regarding potential debt at overseas units have all been settled with gm , " he said .
" the size of the reported debt looks absurdly high . "
on the table there still remains the sticking point of agreement with daewoo 's unions , which have been trying to broaden the scope of the takeover and save more jobs .
the terms of the deal currently under discussion call for a $ 400m payment from gm in exchange for two plants within korea and two outside the country , in egypt and vietnam .
the agreement came after daewoo was declared bankrupt in late 2000 , with liabilities of more than $ 17bn , more than double its assets .

meanwhile , a hungarian paper criticises the appearance of the currency itself as lacking spirit .
euro claims first victim " the euro has produced its first political victim , " says le figaro in paris , referring to the italian foreign minister , renato ruggiero , who resigned on saturday over his government 's position on the single european currency 's introduction .
it says that he was held in esteem by his european counterparts and gave silvio berlusconi 's cabinet international credibility .
the paper says that by taking over the foreign minister 's role on an interim basis " silvio berlusconi seems to want to force his ministers , who are divided on the european issue , to speak with one voice " .
but it warns : " he will first of all have to work on reassuring italy 's allies about his government 's european commitment as the euro crisis is only the latest episode in a long series .

credibility gap munich 's sueddeutsche zeitung sees italy even more isolated in the eu following the foreign minister 's resignation .
ruggiero , it says , left the government of prime minister berlusconi after a series of rows over european union matters , with ruggiero taking the pro-european stance .

euro star crashes out le soir in brussels also thinks that ruggiero gave the italian government " international credibility " and says that berlusconi has lost his " european star " .
it adds that by quitting the government , ruggiero has let europe know that the ruling coalition " is not a transparent and sincere partner " .
the paper says that the minister , who had already had differences with the most anti-european of his fellow ministers , " could not stand the hesitant introduction of the euro being brandished by them as a populist arm " .
