the breakthrough raises hopes that women who are currently unable to have children because their uterus has been damaged could eventually become mothers .
however , a leading uk expert has warned against fuelling expectation unjustifiably .
the woman underwent surgery six years after having a hysterectomy following a life-threatening haemorrhage . "
there is a small group of women who are very keen to have children and who would be prepared to undergo that sort of surgery to achieve that end " dr richard smith the donor organ came from a 46-year-old woman .
the transplanted uterus eventually had to be removed after three months because blood clots had developed and started to cause tissue damage .
however , doctors , who performed the transplant operation in saudi arabia in april 2000 , say the operation was not a failure because the uterus did respond well for a time .
it was kept viable by feeding it a supply of the female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone .
blood supply problems unlike other organs , which are supplied by large blood vessels , the uterus receives its blood supply from a network of tiny vessels .
this means that establishing a blood supply for the transplanted organ is extremely complex , and prone to problems .
in addition , the blood vessels supplying the uterus must be able to expand to three times their normal size during pregnancy if they are to support a developing foetus .
the team of four doctors , wafa fageeh , hassan raffa , hussain jabbad and anass marzouki describe the procedure in the international journal of gynaecology & obstetrics .
they said : " further clinical experience and additional development of the surgical techniques could make uterine transplantation useful in the treatment of infertility , especially in communities where the surrogate mother concept is unacceptable from a religious or ethical point of view . "
surrogacy " putting a rotting piece of meat in the pelvis , which is what will happen with a womb transplant , will endanger the life of the recipient " lord winston in a related editorial , us experts dr louis keith and dr guiseppe del priore described transplantation of the reproductive organs as the " last frontier " in the field of organ transplantation .
they wrote : " to some individuals , childbearing is the greatest event of a lifetime .
" to such persons , transplantation of organs of reproduction would not be considered frivolous or unnecessary , even though these organs do not sustain life . "
their views were reflected by dr richard smith , from the chelsea and westminster hospital in london , who has been carrying out laboratory experiments to test the feasibility of a uterus transplant .
he says that a similar operation should be possible in the uk in two years .
he said : " there is a small group of women who are very keen to have children and who would be prepared to undergo that sort of surgery to achieve that end . "
it is estimated that 15,000 women in the uk are unable to have children by any fertility method currently available .
this is either because they have developed severe fibroids , have damage to the lining of the womb , or have undergone a hysterectomy operation .
around 200 of these women each year opt for surrogacy .
peter bowen-simpkins , from the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists , said he believed the development would eventually lead to women without a uterus being able to give birth .
" this shows it is technically possible .
the womb survived for more than two menstrual cycles , so the first crucial hurdles have been passed . "
however , fertility expert lord robert winston said he was very sceptical about the procedure , and warned against raising women 's hopes unrealistically .
he said : " putting a rotting piece of meat in the pelvis , which is what will happen with a womb transplant , will endanger the life of the recipient of the transplant and could cause a thrombosis .
" it would not be ethically justified in britain or in the united states . "

a bbc correspondent near the battle zone said overnight bombing was the most intense so far as the operation entered its sixth day .
flashes lit up the night sky and dozens of helicopters flying into the combat zone were believed to have been carrying more us and allied troops .
our correspondent in gardez , adam brookes , says the taleban and al-qaeda forces have broken up into small , well armed units , which are carrying out highly mobile guerrilla warfare using networks of caves .
and he says that american and coalition troops were now engaged in close quarter combat with them .
an afghan commander who brought in men from his base north east of gardez , estimated that about 5,000 afghan troops were preparing to join the us-led force .
upper hand as the battle raged , the pentagon said opposition fighters were putting up stiff resistance in the snow-capped mountains .
us estimates of enemy strength began at 150 to 200 but were later increased to between 600 to 700 .
the fighters are believed to have regrouped in the mountains after the taleban fell back from their spiritual centre of kandahar in december .
reports say the fighters are armed with ak-47 automatic rifles , mortars , rocket-propelled grenades and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles .
afghan forces fighting with the americans have been offering residents in paktia province $ 4,000 rewards to turn in al-qaeda members .
major general frank hagenbeck , commander of the operation , which has been named operation anaconda , said us-led troops had gained the upper hand after killing about half the enemy forces .
" we own the dominant terrain in the area , " he said .
" we truly have the momentum at this point . "
general tommy franks , the most senior us field commander in the afghan campaign , said on wednesday that the number of american troops committed to the operation had been increased to about 1,100 .
allies determined " i think the days ahead are going to continue to be dangerous for our forces but the alternative to taking such a risk is not acceptable , " general franks said .
in kabul , afghan interim leader hamid karzai said the coalition was prepared to take as long as necessary to crush al-qaeda .
" it may be a day or two , or it may take longer , " he said .
" we are determined . "
neither the former taleban leader mullah mohammed omar nor al-qaeda leader osama bin laden are believed to be in the area .
eight us servicemen have been killed in the operation so far - seven in two attacks on helicopters on monday and another in a ground battle on saturday .
nine us soldiers have been injured .
the number of afghan casualties is not known .
general hagenbeck said that the offensive had been launched following intelligence that taleban and al-qaeda fighters had been plotting terrorist attacks against the new interim administration in kabul .

she was concerned that microsoft was not as forthcoming as required by law about its contacts with the department of justice and congress during the settlement process , and a lawyer for the american anti-trust institute drove that point home .

mr bork is a darling of the conservative legal set and as an anti-trust scholar was thought to advocate a light touch from government regulators .
that made it all the more shocking to conservatives when he was retained by netscape in their battle against microsoft .
but there he stood , calling for much stronger limits on microsoft 's market behaviour on behalf of procomp , a trade group of bill gate 's competitors who would like nothing more than to see microsoft defanged .
microsoft has steadfastly maintained that it did nothing wrong but compete fiercely in a fiercely competitive market .
mr bork painted quite a different picture and said that microsoft 's anti-competitive behaviours had illegally harmed both its competitors and consumers .
" you do n't have to assume harm because there on the floor is the corpse of netscape 's browser , " he said .
wait for the ruling but after all of the calls from microsoft and the us government for quick approval of the settlement , do n't expect this case to go quickly .
the judge says she has a lot to digest .
as the hearing came to a close , judge kollar-kotelly said , " this is a very important and complex case to which i am going to give careful and thoughtful attention . "
a decision could be weeks or even months away , and nine states who did not sign onto the settlement still have yet to argue for stiffer penalties .

falling payouts 25 yr policy : Â£ 93,145 in 2001 Â£ 77,096 in 2002 10 yr policy : Â£ 9,420 in 2001 Â£ 8,126 in 2002 more than 700,000 homeowners are relying on friends provident policies to pay off their mortgages when they mature .
they hold endowment mortgages , where they pay only interest until the end of the mortgage term , typically after 25 years .
market woes at that point their maturing endowment policy must be worth more than the original amount borrowed .
if it is worth less , they could face shock demands for thousands of pounds to make up the difference - just when they thought they had paid off the mortgage .
friends provident said payouts on with profit endowment policies would fall - an effect of slumping stock markets which have meant it has not been able to make as much money for its customers .
a payout on a 25-year endowment policy maturing this year would fall to Â£ 77,096 - compared to Â£ 93,145 had it matured last year .
similarly , a 10-year policy taken out in 1992 would pay just Â£ 8,126 this year , compared to Â£ 9,420 for the same policy maturing last year .
widespread problem across the country more than 6 million people have endowment mortgages which rely on endowment policies to pay off the original loan .
in the last two years , some 500,000 endowment holders have been sent letters coded " red " - warning that their policies are likely to be worth too little to pay off their mortgages .
around 2.5 million households have " amber " letters - warning their policies are in some danger of falling short .
until now the rest - around half the total - have stayed on track .
but friends provident 's announcement shows that last year 's poor investment climate - where the ftse-100 index fell by nearly 16 % - has made matters worse .
next month it will begin mailing its endowment mortgage customers for the second time .
it is expected , as with other life insurers , that more customers than before will receive the most serious warnings , coded " red " .
separately , friends provident boosted profits in the second half of the year , to Â£ 196m in the year to 31 december compared with Â£ 125m in the previous six months .

owners railtrack have agreed a multi-million pound contract to protect the landmark against the elements .
the previous contractor pulled out in february 2000 , blaming poor weather conditions suffered by those working on the rail link between fife and the lothians .
the bridge links fife and the lothians railtrack decided in 1997 to undertake a four-year project which would cover the structure in a glass-based substance designed to protect the bridge for 25 years .
it was thought this would be better than the traditional paint , which had to be applied to the 112-year-old structure continuously .
however , work ground to a halt when scaffolders working for aberdeen-based company rigblast downed tools two years ago complaining of incessant gales , rain , cold and snow .
only a third of the work had been completed some two years into the Â£ 35m four-year contract .
rigblast then had to remove 4,000 tonnes of scaffolding from the second longest three-cantilever rail bridge in the world .
it 's looking very positive for the bridge , which is of crucial importance to the rail industry and is a true scottish landmark railtrack spokeswoman a rigblast spokesman said : " the job was a health and safety nightmare .
" imagine getting scaffolders carrying a board up there on the top of the bridge in high winds . "
however , work on the 1.1 mile bridge is now expected to resume within weeks .
railtrack has refused to say who is being considered for the new contract or how long it will last .
but it has hired construction company balfour beatty to draw up plans for the work .
a railtrack spokeswoman said : " we ca n't go into the details of the contract because we 're still working on the fine details .
" but it 's looking very positive for the bridge , which is of crucial importance to the rail industry and is a true scottish landmark . "
