germany 's interior minister avoided a possible dispute with the united states sunday when he said a us extradition request for al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh would have priority over a german one . heading off a possible confrontation at the pass , interior minister otto schily told reporters on sunday that germany would allow us investigators first crack at top terrorist suspect ramzi binalshibh , arrested in pakistan last week .
binalshibh , currently under interrogation by pakistani police , is on germany 's most wanted list after being charged on sept .
20 , 2001 with being part of a terrorist organization .
binalshibh is believed to be the logistical expert in mohammed atta 's hamburg terrorist cell and revealed in an interview his intricate knowledge of the planning behind the sept .
11 attacks .
it is for those reasons both german and american investigators are eager to talk to him .
the issue could have become a prickly one , with both america and germany demanding his extradition .
but schily said a us request for extradition " would have priority " over a german one .
" obviously , the usa is the most affected by the horrible attacks , " he said .
" i understand it if they want him first . "
the decision means germany wo n't have to entagle itself in any controversial legal issues dealing with us investigators ' access to the 30-year-old resident of yemen .
had pakistan extradited binalshibh to germany first , then german authorities would have had difficulty delivering him further to the united states because of the country 's stance on the death penalty .
the european human rights convention forbids germany to extradite anyone to a country where they could face the death penalty .

germany 's interior minister avoided a possible dispute with the united states sunday when he said a us extradition request for al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh would have priority over a german one . heading off a possible confrontation at the pass , interior minister otto schily told reporters on sunday that germany would allow us investigators first crack at top terrorist suspect ramzi binalshibh , arrested in pakistan last week .
binalshibh , currently under interrogation by pakistani police , is on germany 's most wanted list after being charged on sept .
20 , 2001 with being part of a terrorist organization .
binalshibh is believed to be the logistical expert in mohammed atta 's hamburg terrorist cell and revealed in an interview his intricate knowledge of the planning behind the sept .
11 attacks .
it is for those reasons both german and american investigators are eager to talk to him .
the issue could have become a prickly one , with both america and germany demanding his extradition .
but schily said a us request for extradition " would have priority " over a german one .
" obviously , the usa is the most affected by the horrible attacks , " he said .
" i understand it if they want him first . "
the decision means germany wo n't have to entagle itself in any controversial legal issues dealing with us investigators ' access to the 30-year-old resident of yemen .
had pakistan extradited binalshibh to germany first , then german authorities would have had difficulty delivering him further to the united states because of the country 's stance on the death penalty .
the european human rights convention forbids germany to extradite anyone to a country where they could face the death penalty .
a goldmine of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tentatively identified as ramzi binalshibh is seen in this video image released by the federal bureau of investigation on jan .
17 , 2002 .

11 attacks was captured in pakistan and in custody , u.s. officials said friday , sept .
13 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / fbi , file -rrb- binalshibh could provide us investigators a wealth of information about the sept .
11 attacks and the way al qaeda operates .
according to reports , binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- was a key al qaeda functionary in hamburg and enjoyed the trust of osama bin laden .
schily 's concession avoids further tensions between germany and the united states . us and german investigators examining al qaeda in germany have already butted heads over procedure and legal issues , report german law enfocement officers .
us federal prosecutors have also been exasperated at germany 's refusal to hand over evidence on zacarias moussaoui , the suspected 20th hijacker in the sept .

germany 's interior minister avoided a possible dispute with the united states sunday when he said a us extradition request for al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh would have priority over a german one . heading off a possible confrontation at the pass , interior minister otto schily told reporters on sunday that germany would allow us investigators first crack at top terrorist suspect ramzi binalshibh , arrested in pakistan last week .
binalshibh , currently under interrogation by pakistani police , is on germany 's most wanted list after being charged on sept .
20 , 2001 with being part of a terrorist organization .
binalshibh is believed to be the logistical expert in mohammed atta 's hamburg terrorist cell and revealed in an interview his intricate knowledge of the planning behind the sept .
11 attacks .
it is for those reasons both german and american investigators are eager to talk to him .
the issue could have become a prickly one , with both america and germany demanding his extradition .
but schily said a us request for extradition " would have priority " over a german one .
" obviously , the usa is the most affected by the horrible attacks , " he said .
" i understand it if they want him first . "
the decision means germany wo n't have to entagle itself in any controversial legal issues dealing with us investigators ' access to the 30-year-old resident of yemen .
had pakistan extradited binalshibh to germany first , then german authorities would have had difficulty delivering him further to the united states because of the country 's stance on the death penalty .
the european human rights convention forbids germany to extradite anyone to a country where they could face the death penalty .

11 attacks and the way al qaeda operates .
according to reports , binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- was a key al qaeda functionary in hamburg and enjoyed the trust of osama bin laden .
schily 's concession avoids further tensions between germany and the united states . us and german investigators examining al qaeda in germany have already butted heads over procedure and legal issues , report german law enfocement officers .
us federal prosecutors have also been exasperated at germany 's refusal to hand over evidence on zacarias moussaoui , the suspected 20th hijacker in the sept .

germany 's interior minister avoided a possible dispute with the united states sunday when he said a us extradition request for al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh would have priority over a german one . heading off a possible confrontation at the pass , interior minister otto schily told reporters on sunday that germany would allow us investigators first crack at top terrorist suspect ramzi binalshibh , arrested in pakistan last week .
binalshibh , currently under interrogation by pakistani police , is on germany 's most wanted list after being charged on sept .
20 , 2001 with being part of a terrorist organization .
binalshibh is believed to be the logistical expert in mohammed atta 's hamburg terrorist cell and revealed in an interview his intricate knowledge of the planning behind the sept .
11 attacks .
it is for those reasons both german and american investigators are eager to talk to him .
the issue could have become a prickly one , with both america and germany demanding his extradition .
but schily said a us request for extradition " would have priority " over a german one .
" obviously , the usa is the most affected by the horrible attacks , " he said .
" i understand it if they want him first . "
the decision means germany wo n't have to entagle itself in any controversial legal issues dealing with us investigators ' access to the 30-year-old resident of yemen .
had pakistan extradited binalshibh to germany first , then german authorities would have had difficulty delivering him further to the united states because of the country 's stance on the death penalty .
the european human rights convention forbids germany to extradite anyone to a country where they could face the death penalty .

germany 's interior minister avoided a possible dispute with the united states sunday when he said a us extradition request for al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh would have priority over a german one . heading off a possible confrontation at the pass , interior minister otto schily told reporters on sunday that germany would allow us investigators first crack at top terrorist suspect ramzi binalshibh , arrested in pakistan last week .
binalshibh , currently under interrogation by pakistani police , is on germany 's most wanted list after being charged on sept .
20 , 2001 with being part of a terrorist organization .
binalshibh is believed to be the logistical expert in mohammed atta 's hamburg terrorist cell and revealed in an interview his intricate knowledge of the planning behind the sept .
11 attacks .
it is for those reasons both german and american investigators are eager to talk to him .
the issue could have become a prickly one , with both america and germany demanding his extradition .
but schily said a us request for extradition " would have priority " over a german one .
" obviously , the usa is the most affected by the horrible attacks , " he said .
" i understand it if they want him first . "
the decision means germany wo n't have to entagle itself in any controversial legal issues dealing with us investigators ' access to the 30-year-old resident of yemen .
had pakistan extradited binalshibh to germany first , then german authorities would have had difficulty delivering him further to the united states because of the country 's stance on the death penalty .
the european human rights convention forbids germany to extradite anyone to a country where they could face the death penalty .

the topic will be discussed at the beginning of 2003 . “ no one in the transportation ministry will dispute the need for an environment-friendly flood protection ´ plan to hinder future flood catastrophes after today , ” said gerd billen , director of the environmental organization nabu , one of several organizations to greet the proposals . following flooding along the elbe and danube rivers and their tributaries last month , experts and environmentalists had criticized the german government 's river development policies .
steffi lemke , a parliamentary leader of germany ’ s green party said that if things aren ’ t changed “ we ’ re asking for a century of ‘ floods of the century . ’ ” the government responded with the one-day national flooding conference , which brought together the country ’ s interior , environment , economic and agriculture and consumer affairs ministers with state government representatives and environmental organizations . the five-point plan of prevention the participants were able to agree on a plan rather quickly . rivers should be given back their natural flood plains – even if that means clearing what is now farmland near the rivers and getting rid of the levees and other regulatory measures that environmentalists said have increased the rivers ’ speed four times .
germany ’ s states must also do more to prohibit residential and commerical development on flood plains . government on the state and national level should work better together in developing flood warnings and the possible danger flood waters could have on surrounding areas . cooperation on a european level needs to improve .
the german governing coalition said it was willing to help finance cooperative flood fighting measures with neighboring countries . the participants demanded a stop to the expansion of the elbe river to accomodate larger volumes of boat traffic .
environmentalists the manipulation of the elbe was one of the major reasons it flooded as much as it did last month .
the final paper said the government would take up the issue again at the beginning of 2003 and develop ” river traffic in a more environmental-friendly manner . ” victims of last months flood , which caused billions of euro in damage and left thousands homeless , will have immediate access to the 500 million euro the government has set aside for them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rethinking germany ’ s rivers in the wake of central europe ’ s devastating floods , politicians in germany are reconsidering the country ’ s policies toward its rivers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.09.2002 germany offers terror suspect to us first großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the terror suspect was arrested after a gun battle that lasted more than 2 hours .
germany 's interior minister avoided a possible dispute with the united states sunday when he said a us extradition request for al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh would have priority over a german one . heading off a possible confrontation at the pass , interior minister otto schily told reporters on sunday that germany would allow us investigators first crack at top terrorist suspect ramzi binalshibh , arrested in pakistan last week .
binalshibh , currently under interrogation by pakistani police , is on germany 's most wanted list after being charged on sept .
20 , 2001 with being part of a terrorist organization .
binalshibh is believed to be the logistical expert in mohammed atta 's hamburg terrorist cell and revealed in an interview his intricate knowledge of the planning behind the sept .
11 attacks .
it is for those reasons both german and american investigators are eager to talk to him .
the issue could have become a prickly one , with both america and germany demanding his extradition .
but schily said a us request for extradition " would have priority " over a german one .
" obviously , the usa is the most affected by the horrible attacks , " he said .
" i understand it if they want him first . "
the decision means germany wo n't have to entagle itself in any controversial legal issues dealing with us investigators ' access to the 30-year-old resident of yemen .
had pakistan extradited binalshibh to germany first , then german authorities would have had difficulty delivering him further to the united states because of the country 's stance on the death penalty .
the european human rights convention forbids germany to extradite anyone to a country where they could face the death penalty .
a goldmine of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tentatively identified as ramzi binalshibh is seen in this video image released by the federal bureau of investigation on jan .
17 , 2002 .
binalshibh , a suspected organizer of the sept .
11 attacks was captured in pakistan and in custody , u.s. officials said friday , sept .
13 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / fbi , file -rrb- binalshibh could provide us investigators a wealth of information about the sept .
11 attacks and the way al qaeda operates .
according to reports , binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- was a key al qaeda functionary in hamburg and enjoyed the trust of osama bin laden .
schily 's concession avoids further tensions between germany and the united states . us and german investigators examining al qaeda in germany have already butted heads over procedure and legal issues , report german law enfocement officers .
us federal prosecutors have also been exasperated at germany 's refusal to hand over evidence on zacarias moussaoui , the suspected 20th hijacker in the sept .
11 attacks who never made it one the plane because he was rejected for a visa .
germany has refused becuase of the possibility moussaoui could face death penalty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic fight against terror floundering ?

germany 's interior minister avoided a possible dispute with the united states sunday when he said a us extradition request for al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh would have priority over a german one . heading off a possible confrontation at the pass , interior minister otto schily told reporters on sunday that germany would allow us investigators first crack at top terrorist suspect ramzi binalshibh , arrested in pakistan last week .
binalshibh , currently under interrogation by pakistani police , is on germany 's most wanted list after being charged on sept .

binalshibh is believed to be the logistical expert in mohammed atta 's hamburg terrorist cell and revealed in an interview his intricate knowledge of the planning behind the sept .
11 attacks .
it is for those reasons both german and american investigators are eager to talk to him .
the issue could have become a prickly one , with both america and germany demanding his extradition .
but schily said a us request for extradition " would have priority " over a german one .
" obviously , the usa is the most affected by the horrible attacks , " he said .
" i understand it if they want him first . "
the decision means germany wo n't have to entagle itself in any controversial legal issues dealing with us investigators ' access to the 30-year-old resident of yemen .
had pakistan extradited binalshibh to germany first , then german authorities would have had difficulty delivering him further to the united states because of the country 's stance on the death penalty .

germany 's interior minister avoided a possible dispute with the united states sunday when he said a us extradition request for al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh would have priority over a german one . heading off a possible confrontation at the pass , interior minister otto schily told reporters on sunday that germany would allow us investigators first crack at top terrorist suspect ramzi binalshibh , arrested in pakistan last week .
binalshibh , currently under interrogation by pakistani police , is on germany 's most wanted list after being charged on sept .
20 , 2001 with being part of a terrorist organization .
binalshibh is believed to be the logistical expert in mohammed atta 's hamburg terrorist cell and revealed in an interview his intricate knowledge of the planning behind the sept .
11 attacks .
it is for those reasons both german and american investigators are eager to talk to him .
the issue could have become a prickly one , with both america and germany demanding his extradition .
but schily said a us request for extradition " would have priority " over a german one .
" obviously , the usa is the most affected by the horrible attacks , " he said .
" i understand it if they want him first . "
the decision means germany wo n't have to entagle itself in any controversial legal issues dealing with us investigators ' access to the 30-year-old resident of yemen .
had pakistan extradited binalshibh to germany first , then german authorities would have had difficulty delivering him further to the united states because of the country 's stance on the death penalty .
the european human rights convention forbids germany to extradite anyone to a country where they could face the death penalty .

according to reports , binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- was a key al qaeda functionary in hamburg and enjoyed the trust of osama bin laden .
schily 's concession avoids further tensions between germany and the united states . us and german investigators examining al qaeda in germany have already butted heads over procedure and legal issues , report german law enfocement officers .

the warning to the iraqi dictator - the strongest yet from the government - followed a call by us president george bush to the un to " show some backbone " and confront saddam over iraq . "
they -lrb- iraq -rrb- have been playing games with us for long enough " jack straw mr straw , speaking from the un where intensive discussions are under way about a possible new resolution against baghdad , said there was not a foreign minister in the world that did not want to see the back of the iraqi president .
he said the un security council must pose to saddam a " very clear choice : either he deals with those weapons of mass destruction or his regime will have to end " .
" but the choice is his , and he has n't got much time to make up his mind , " the foreign secretary said in an interview due to be broadcast on sky 's sunday with adam boulton programme .
iraq dossier mr straw also promised that the dossier which will be produced by the government in 10 days ' time will contain " new facts " about saddam 's regime .
mr straw added : " they -lrb- iraq -rrb- have been playing games with us for long enough , played games with world peace for long enough . "
the iraqis had been playing " fast and loose with the international community " , he said .
weapons inspectors had to be readmitted " without restriction , without condition " .
the foreign secretary said he had talked to his counterparts around the world at the un meeting and there was " overwhelming support " for president bush 's position .
iraq was an " extraordinarily dangerous regime that needs to be brought within the international legal system " .
the government 's dossier against iraq , expected in time for when parliament is recalled on 24 september , will contain evidence of saddam 's chemical and biological weapons , and his desire to acquire nuclear weapons , mr straw said .
it would include information published last week by the international institute for strategic studies and as much intelligence information as possible , he added .
" it will contain new facts , " mr straw said .
" there is no need to look in the crystal about the record of saddam hussein , it is there in the book . "
' no split ' mr straw 's comments were likely to anger many labour mps , including the former culture secretary chris smith , who has warned an attack on iraq would cause the " disintegration of the international coalition against terrorism " .
but the foreign secretary denied there was a split in the cabinet over iraq .
he said : " i have no argument with my cabinet colleagues about this .
what the cabinet will want to discuss is how we will proceed from where we are to the future .
" i believe that you will find that this cabinet is as united on the need for resolute action as it has been in the past . "
earlier , in a speech to the un general assembly , the foreign secretary said the un must insist saddam re-admitted weapons inspectors or both the organisation and iraq would face the consequences .
he said the international community must not " stand by and do nothing " while saddam " persistently mocked " the authority of the un by defying its resolutions on weapons of mass destruction .
the un had to be clear to baghdad and to itself of the " consequences which will flow from a failure by iraq to meet its obligations " , he said .
if the un failed to deal with the challenge of iraq , it would be " seriously weakened " , making the world a much more dangerous place , the foreign secretary said .
liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said : " no one could quarrel with the foreign secretary when he says that the authority of the un must be upheld .
" but the united nations is bound by international law .
military action must be a last resort when all other diplomatic and political alternatives have failed . "

bush said world peace was at stake mr straw added : " they -lrb- iraq -rrb- have been playing games with us for long enough , played games with world peace for long enough . "
the iraqis had been playing " fast and loose with the international community " , he said .
weapons inspectors had to be readmitted " without restriction , without condition " .
the foreign secretary said he had talked to his counterparts around the world at the un meeting and there was " overwhelming support " for president bush 's position .
iraq was an " extraordinarily dangerous regime that needs to be brought within the international legal system " .
the government 's dossier against iraq , expected in time for when parliament is recalled on 24 september , will contain evidence of saddam 's chemical and biological weapons , and his desire to acquire nuclear weapons , mr straw said .
it would include information published last week by the international institute for strategic studies and as much intelligence information as possible , he added .
" it will contain new facts , " mr straw said .
" there is no need to look in the crystal about the record of saddam hussein , it is there in the book . "
' no split ' mr straw 's comments were likely to anger many labour mps , including the former culture secretary chris smith , who has warned an attack on iraq would cause the " disintegration of the international coalition against terrorism " .
but the foreign secretary denied there was a split in the cabinet over iraq .
he said : " i have no argument with my cabinet colleagues about this .
what the cabinet will want to discuss is how we will proceed from where we are to the future .
saddam hussein is accused of " mocking " un " i believe that you will find that this cabinet is as united on the need for resolute action as it has been in the past . "
earlier , in a speech to the un general assembly , the foreign secretary said the un must insist saddam re-admitted weapons inspectors or both the organisation and iraq would face the consequences .
he said the international community must not " stand by and do nothing " while saddam " persistently mocked " the authority of the un by defying its resolutions on weapons of mass destruction .
the un had to be clear to baghdad and to itself of the " consequences which will flow from a failure by iraq to meet its obligations " , he said .
if the un failed to deal with the challenge of iraq , it would be " seriously weakened " , making the world a much more dangerous place , the foreign secretary said .
liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said : " no one could quarrel with the foreign secretary when he says that the authority of the un must be upheld .
" but the united nations is bound by international law .
military action must be a last resort when all other diplomatic and political alternatives have failed .
