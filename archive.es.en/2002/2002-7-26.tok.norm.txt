after last year 's announcement that more than 27,000 jobs were in danger at four major german banks , more financial institutions find themselves victims of the slide after more bad news . at the end of last year , the main players in the german banking world - commerzbank , deutsche , dresdner and hypovereinsbank ag - released the grim news that more than 27,000 employees would lose their jobs in a bid to save the companies from potential ruin .
hypovereinsbank announces first-ever operating loss on friday , further bad news for bankers surfaced as hypovereinsbank ag announced the first operating loss in its history and news broke of the planned closure of 21 branches of sparkasse berlin .
hypovereinsbank showed the true extent of the current weakness of the capital markets by presenting an operating loss , which would have been accompanied by a net loss had it not been for exceptional gains .
in its half-yearly report , hypovereinsbank , the second largest in germany , recorded an operating loss of 89 million euros -lrb- $ 89.4 million -rrb- after profits of 330 million in the first quarter and 286 million in the second quarter of 2002 .
hypovereinsbank ’ s chief executive , albrecht schmidt , described the result as ' challenging ' and indicated that the bank would probably have to revise down its full-year forecasts .
berlin hit by news of proposed banking cull sparkasse berlin added to the general feeling of impending doom in the sector when it announced on friday that it planned to close 21 of its 178 branches .
further losses in the city were reported by the berliner bank , which said it had made it own plans to close 20 of its banking facilities .
the steady stream of bad tidings is increasing concern regarding the state of germany 's banking health .
speaking at a joint presentation with allianz chief henning schulte-noelle , dresdner bank chairman bernd fahrholz said of the current climate , " we are dealing with a real crisis .
we find ourselves in a very fragile situation . "
after taking over the bank last year , industry insiders widely predict that allianz ’ s second-quarter figures , due for release on august 14 , will bear the scars of the troubles dresdner is currently experiencing .
big names shed workforce and report losses very few institutions seem to be immune from the downward trend .
commerzbank , the country 's third biggest listed bank , has made a number of sweeping job cuts while deutsche bank recently announced a restructuring charge of about 265 million euros to be booked in the second quarter of 2002 .
as a result of the restructuring , a total of approximately 1,970 staff , across all grades in the deutsche bank 's offices around the world , will be affected .
the plan will be carried out over the next 12 months .

president bush is hoping to reassure investors the bill passed in both the house of representatives and the senate on the same day , as lawmakers hurried to get a signature from president george w bush as early as possible .
the legislation is being accelerated as congress members struggle to appear purposeful ahead of congressional elections in november .
it aims to reassure investors of the trustworthiness of corporate america , with stock markets suffering heavy losses in recent weeks .
tougher penalties now that the bill has been approved , a public company accounting oversight board is to be established to oversee auditors of public companies .
maximum jail sentences for wire and mail fraud will increase to 20 years .
and a new crime on securities fraud will carry a 25-year maximum sentence .
the tightening of controls comes after a series of scandals which include energy failure enron , accountants andersen and telecoms firm worldcom .
' cosmetic change ' but not everyone is wholly convinced that the bill is much more than a political gesture .
" people have lost their pensions , their retirement , " said democratic whip nancy pelosi .
" in the name of corporate reform they -lsb- the house of representatives -rsb- continue to pursue cosmetic rather than real change . "
president bush welcomed the bill , however , greeting it as a key part of his recently-announced plan to boost corporate responsibility and ethical standards .

seven more miners were injured in the blast at the privately-run taojiawan coal mine in liupanshui .
an investigation has been launched into the accident , which brought the death toll for miners in china to more than 240 since june and about 3,500 for the year so far .
earlier this month , the authorities told 10,000 miners to leave their jobs in a crackdown against illegal gold mines in northern shanxi province following a string of high-profile disasters .
correspondents say that central and local authorities publicise their efforts to close unlicensed mines and those which fail to pass safety tests .
but they add that many small mines ordered to close manage to re-open because local governments are hungry for tax revenues .

excessive deficits could threaten the stability of the eurozone and in 1997 member countries agreed to a stability and growth pact in order to make sure the zone 's economies keep in step with each other .
under the pact , deficits should not rise above 3 % of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the commission 's sanctions procedure will start just months after a formal warning was issued when portugal appeared close to breaching the eurozone 's pact .
the warning was followed by a compromise which allowed portugal more time to get back into line after it promised to reduce its deficit and come close to a balanced budget by 2004 .
first time the commission 's sanctions have never been used before under the terms of the pact .
in fact , the commission is loath to use it unless it has to .
earlier this month , moves were made in brussels to relax budget rules to give member countries more freedom to fuel economic growth with public investment .
a proposal , due this autumn , is set to outline common standards for economic policy which should preserve macroeconomic stability raise the economic growth potential cope with economic shocks the move is seen as a response to criticism from several european union member states which have been angered by what they see as the commission 's meddling with their national spending plans .
" the concept of the excessive deficit procedure does not exist to penalise people , but to prevent problems , " said commission spokesman , gerassimos thomas .
sanctions procedure under the commission 's excessive deficit procedure , a report about portugal 's deficit will be presented to the european union 's economic and financial committee .
portugal will then be told by the committee to " take effective action " .
if this is not done , sanctions could be imposed .

liberal democrat defence spokesman paul keetch said british frontline soldiers should be given a replacement for the sa-80 rifle .
for british soldiers to be deployed with a weapon that has operated below par for over a decade is scandalous paul keetch marines in afghanistan have said the new sa80-a2 guns failed on at least three occasions - despite £ 92m worth of modifications following complaints about the previous model .
an inquiry into the claims is believed to have concluded that inadequate maintenance and cleaning was to blame .
' waste of money ' mr keetch said : " the sa-80 is fatally flawed .
british soldiers deserve the best .
the sa-80 is not it - it must be replaced .
" it is no good blaming soldiers for inadequate maintenance of the sa-80 when field tests have been fudged . "
he said the £ 92m upgrade had been a waste of money .
mr keetch : sa-80 is fatally flawed " more than three times the amount man united paid for rio ferdinand , " he continued .
in his letter to mr hoon , he wrote : " confidence in your weapon is a prerequisite for any soldier .
" for british soldiers to be deployed with a weapon that has operated below par for over a decade is scandalous " .
a series of problems with the previous sa80 rifle , including the weapon jamming in extreme temperatures , led to it being suspended from the nato nominated weapon list in 1997 .
defence spending mr keetch said that much had been made of the increase in defence spending to pay for high tech , computer-based systems needed to fight modern expeditionary warfare .
but he said : " most soldiers would find the choice between ' network centric systems ' and a rifle that works fairly easy to make . "
mr hoon has already promised that claims that the sa-80-a2 misfires badly will be looked into .
earlier this month he said that a specialist team in afghanistan was investigating reports of problems with the rifle in dusty conditions and extremes of temperature . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's andrew gilligan " this is the british forces standard weapon " see also : 21 jul 02 -pipe- politics rifle failure ' fault of marines ' 03 jul 02 -pipe- politics probe into faulty army rifles 23 jun 00 -pipe- politics ' faulty ' rifle gets £ 80m makeover 25 feb 00 -pipe- uk rifle recall could cost millions 11 mar 99 -pipe- uk desert ' too tough ' for army 's rifle internet links : ministry of defence british army the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites e-mail this story to a friend ^ ^ back to top news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes - to bbc sport > > -pipe- to bbc weather > > -pipe- to bbc world service > > - © mmiii -pipe- news sources -pipe- privacy

tory leader iain duncan smith said it was among a number of options being " looked at " as part of a wide-ranging review of health policy .
i have n't sacked anybody iain duncan smith mr duncan smith also denied " sacking " former party chairman david davis .
in an interview with bbc two 's newsnight , the tory leader dismissed as " flim flam " suggestions he had taken advantage of mr davis ' absence on holiday to get rid of him .
' dark forces ' mr davis ' surprise move to shadow deputy prime minister john prescott was widely interpreted as a demotion for a man suspected of having designs on the leader 's job for himself .
shadow commons leader eric forth , was quoted in the press as saying " dark forces " were behind mr davis ' replacement by theresa may , which took place while mr davis was on holiday in florida .
but mr duncan smith insisted the move was a response tony blair 's cabinet reshuffle earlier this year , which handed a " beefed-up " role to mr prescott .
' done a good job ' the tory leader said : " i have n't sacked anybody .
" if you sack somebody they disappear out of their job and they are not employed any longer .
" david has done a good job and i think he will be absolutely perfect to take on the deputy prime minister . "
he added : " david and i talked about it .
david has accepted that job .
" i happen to think he 'll do a very good job . "

his defence of the one-time leadership contender comes as newspaper reports claim mr davis had to be talked out of resigning from the shadow cabinet .
one friend , eric forth , shadow leader of the house , accused " dark forces " of taking advantage of mr davis 's absence to sack him , reviving concerns that his demotion would reopen splits within the party .
lost favour according to a variety of newspapers mr forth persuaded mr davis to remain on the front benches as a way of safeguarding his position as a future conservative leader .
iain duncan smith sacked mr davis on tuesday and gave him a new role shadowing deputy prime minister john prescott .
forth : persuaded mr davis to stay on the frontbench there had been reports that mr davis lost favour because he had failed to drive through reforms to ensure the party had greater numbers of women and ethnic minority candidates .

' disappointed ' but mr whincup told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " we should make clear that it was n't an ill-timed holiday .
" this was by agreement with iain duncan smith because david was covering from august while iain duncan smith was away on holiday . "
but mr whincup stressed : " it was also ill-timing by those who brief against david , both within and without the party that they left it until he went on holiday and i think that 's the sad part , that they could n't stand face to face with him . "
asked how mr davis felt about losing his job , mr whincup replied : " he is obviously disappointed , but at the same time ... he 's looking to the challenge of the new job and taking on john prescott .
theresa may is the conservative 's first woman chairman " and i know who will be the winner in that battle . "
mr forth spoke out at mr duncan smith 's treatment of mr davis to stress : " the frustrating thing for him is he has been so far away throughout all of this that he has been at a terrific disadvantage .
" it 's pretty obvious that there have been dark forces at work taking advantage of his absence , " he told the financial times .
davis supporters a number of tory mps , who are close to mr davis , have indicated that they are prepared to work on his behalf , the telegraph said .
" we will help him make his role against prescott a success , so that people can see how valuable he could be as leader , " one was reported to have said .
" if there is a big game afoot for david then the worst thing he can do is flounce off to the back benches .
" he is temperamentally very proud and wanted to walk out , but we 've persuaded him to play a longer game . "
meanwhile , michael normington , chairman of the charter movement which represents grassroots tories , said it was clear there was no love lost between the former party chairman and mr duncan smith .
separate roles it was time for the chairman to be elected from outside the party , he said .
" here again we have an incident where the party chairman and the leader seem to be quite some way apart , " he said .
" we have always been told that its so important that they are so close that you can not fit a cigarette paper between them .
" here you seem to have been able to have fit a battalion of tanks and this leads further weight to our call that the post should be split .
" you should have somebody going round the country making speeches on behalf of the leader and we should have somebody else who is responsible for running the party organisation , who infact does not need to be an mp .
" we need someone who is prepared to listen to what the members of the constituencies actually want , which i 'm afraid david davis and most of his predecessors , have not done , " mr normington told today .
mr davis was said to be " astounded " by the ferocity of briefings against him .
he was replaced by theresa may , making her the party 's first woman chairman .
