"
it would be good if the home secretary could deliver a little more consensus and a little less assertiveness " simon hughes home secretary david blunkett wants an increased role for the private sector in police stations .
but he was fought all the way by opposition peers , who had already savaged his flagship police reform bill at its report stage .
the bill went into its third lords reading the day after mr blunkett caused a storm by warning of asylum seekers " swamping " some schools and gp surgeries .
it also followed prime minister tony blair 's pledge to crackdown on surging street crime by september .
labour party chairman charles clarke said : " the decision of the conservatives and liberal democrats to vote to reduce the detention powers of community support officers is absolutely staggering .
" it shows unequivocally that their commitment to reducing street crime is wafer thin .
he added : " the conservatives and liberal democrats simply do not give street crime the vital priority it desperately needs . "
but lib dem home affairs spokesman lord dholakia said the defeats signalled that the government should " stop reacting to newspaper headlines and concentrate instead on enabling police officers to get on with protecting our communities " .
" liberal democrats believe that this bill now goes to the house of commons in much better shape than when it arrived , " he said .
' stupidity ' peers objected to mr blunkett 's plans to replace detention officers in police stations with private security guards .
the second lords defeat came when peers backed an amendment to remove the power of the home secretary to change those police powers available to civilian staff or accredited security staff working on the controversial community warden scheme .
two further defeats followed as an alliance of lib dem and tory peers rejected plans to allow community support officers or civilian police staff the power to detain people for up to 30 minutes .
home office minister lord rooker pledged that mr blunkett would seek to reverse most of the amendments when the bill returned to the commons .
earlier the home secretary acknowledged he was considering replacing detention officers with private security guards in an effort to get more police officers patrolling the streets .
no decisions have yet been made on the issue , stressed mr blunkett , but the liberal democrats have condemned the idea as the " height of stupidity " .
a leaked memo revealing the idea warned lord rooker not to mention the prospect of privatisation of this police role when discussing the bill in the lords .
it said : " on no account read out the following paragraph .
" at the moment the bill does not allow for detention officers to be contracted out to the private sector but we are hoping to be able to put forward amendments in the commons to enable that .
" provided they are properly trained , there is no reason why such privately employed staff should not be able to conduct intimate searches . "
mr blunkett said he was not supposed to criticise civil servants but said the warning was a " pretty silly thing to write down " .
bobbies on the beat " we want to try and get uniformed trained police officers out on the beat in the community , " mr blunkett told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" to do so , we are prepared to use detention officers who are trained or custody nurses to do the body search . "
those nurses could be employed by the national health service , said mr blunkett .
but ian blair , deputy commissioner of the metropolitan police said there was no reason why trained officers could not take on such powers under the supervision of a police officer .
policing worries shadow home secretary oliver letwin underlined the conservatives ' continued opposition to the bill .
" by introducing a vast array of auxiliaries run by a whole host of disparate organisations with a disparate array of powers , there is a real risk that neighbourhood policing will be diminished , not enhanced , " said mr letwin .
those officers would be directly employed by the police , he said , so guarding against a host of other organisations taking up street patrols .

i find it staggering that the prime minister was willing to take the credit for a change in technology that would have led to a cut in crime richard barnes tory spokesman mr blair told mps on wednesday that london 's sharp rise in street robberies would be brought under control within five months .
now number 10 has said the prime minister was only building on a pledge the government made in february to tackle crime on london 's streets within six months .
the government says it is focusing its efforts on the 10 areas where people are 80 % more likely to be mugged .
although home secretary david blunkett later said that he did not believe failure to meet the deadline should amount to a resigning matter .
but he insisted the government would tackle street crime as they had tackled burglary and vehicle crime after 1997 .
" -lsb- street crime -rsb- applies everywhere , but we 're targeting the 10 most difficult areas where over 80 % of street crime currently occurs and i think most people would expect us to do that , " he said .
richard barnes , the conservatives ' crime spokesman in london and deputy chairman of the metropolitan police authority , accused mr blair of " fiddling the figures " .

mr blair 's spokesman said : " the prime minister is not saying that ... nobody will be mugged on the streets of these 10 areas . "

tory leader iain duncan smith has written to the prime minister demanding to know why the term " cobra " was used by officials to describe the crime summit from where the september deadline had originated .

cobra is usually used as a shorthand for meetings to discuss national emergencies , although on this occasion number 10 insisted the word was merely used to describe the room in which the crime summit took place .
mr duncan smith wrote : " i believe that the last three times -lsb- cobra -rsb- met was for the fuel crisis , foot-and-mouth and the war on terrorism .

it is going to easier to find a good beach this summer .
sixty six more have joined the recommended list in this year 's good beach guide .
there was also a decrease in the number failing the minimum ec standard for bathing water quality .
click to check the good beach guide 2002 marine conservation society findings : improvements in sewage treatment and fine weather have contributed to record improvements in every region of the uk , except for northern ireland .
in the north west a beach at blackpool , where the guide was launched , made the mcs grade for the first time , along with three other recommended beaches in the region .
it is a great year too for the north east which recorded the largest regional increase in recommended beaches , and yet again record numbers were reported in both the south east and south west .
the guide tells a similar story for both scotland and wales with increases in the number of recommended beaches , although there are still a significant number failing the minimum ec water quality standard in both regions .
northern ireland took a step backward this year with fewer recommended beaches and more failing the lowest ec standard for water quality .
the marine conservation society believes work is needed to tackle all sources of bacterial pollution to ensure that no beaches fail and more make the grade for the mcs good beach guide .
seven hundred and ninety five beaches in the uk were monitored for bathing water quality between may and september in 2001 .
nearly half of the beaches are recommended - 341 -lrb- 43 % -rrb- - and met the stringent criteria for clean bathing required by the marine conservation society .

a report from the house of commons public accounts committee said that hefty debts incurred to meet the cost of the licences may force mobile operators to merge , restricting competition and driving up prices .
" it will remain important to ensure a competitive market if the consumers are not to be left with an excessive share of the high costs incurred by the companies , " the committee said .
the mps said mobile phone operators should be allowed to share networks or trade spectrums in order to avoid a surge in costs which would then be passed on to consumers .
cash crunch they also called on the telecoms watchdog oftel to intervene to protect the consumer from overcharging when the next wave of internet-enabled mobile technology becomes available .
in april 2000 , the government raised a total of Â£ 22.5bn in a five-way auction for licences to use the radio spectrums needed to support third generation mobile phone networks .
the five companies bidding for the licences were vodafone , bt , one2one orange and tiw .
the cost of paying for these licences , together with a downturn in the global telecommunications sector , have since hit mobile operators hard .
slowing demand vodafone , once the star of the uk new telecoms sector , has lost nearly 70 % of its peak value after a steady decline in its share price .
there is growing evidence that vodafone , in common with other mobile network operators and handset makers , overestimated demand for mobile services .
nokia shocked investors by downgrading its sales forecasts earlier this month , while rival handset maker ericsson this week unveiled steeper than expected losses and announced plans to axe 20,000 jobs .
earlier this month , the competition commission - the uk 's anti-trust watchdog - launched an investigation into " excessive profits " at four of the big mobile operators .

" i have been invited to seek nomination for the -lsb- opposition -rsb- national party as a candidate in the upcoming general election , and i have decided to accept that invitation , " mr brash said .
mr brash 's surprise resignation sent the bond markets soaring as investors speculated that the departure of the tough inflation beater could mark a move towards a more relaxed monetary policy .
" judging by the price action ... maybe we wo n't see as hawkish an approach to monetary policy management , " said one bond dealer .
careful caretaker ?
last week , mr brash raised interest rates for the second time in a month in order to contain inflation , as set out by a 0-3 % target range .
mr brash , who will run as an opposition politician during the forthcoming general election , will not take part in the central bank 's interest rate setting meeting on 15 may .
" a big increase in the official -lsb- interest -rsb- rate and i could be accused of trying to sabotage the government .
a small or no increase and i could be accused of trying to curry political favour , so of course i will take no part in that decision , " said mr brash .
investors said it was unlikely that deputy governor rod carr , who will step in as a caretaker governor until a permanent replacement has been found , would raise interest rates .
