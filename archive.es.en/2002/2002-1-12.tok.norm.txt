mr stoiber was chosen by germany 's opposition conservatives as their candidate on friday after the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , angela merkel , agreed to step aside .
speaking after his nomination , mr stoiber accused chancellor gerhard schroeder of failing to keep his election promises to cut unemployment .
the christian democrats chose mr stoiber , leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , after months of wavering and political infighting .
polls suggest that the charismatic mr stoiber has the better chance of beating mr schroeder in the 22 september election .
he also has a good track record managing bavaria , whose economy is booming while much of the rest of germany is close to recession .
lacklustre ms merkel is seen as a lacklustre figure .
mr stoiber is more experienced , and further to the right .
in television interviews on friday , he said he would reverse the current government 's decision to phase out germany 's nuclear power stations and would seek better funding for the military .
the bbc 's correspondent rob broomby says mr stoiber victory guarantees a more colourful - although perhaps more divisive - campaign .
his party has repeatedly refused government appeals to keep inflammatory issues like immigration out of the election .
although polls put mr stoiber ahead of ms merkel , they also suggest that mr schroeder remains in the lead overall .
stoiber favoured according to the latest poll , published by the tagesspiegel newspaper on friday , mr schroeder would win 58 % of the vote if the position were directly elected , against 39 % for mr stoiber , and 32 % for ms merkel .
among supporters of the centre-right parties , there was a clear preference for mr stoiber as candidate for the chancellorship , by 76 % to 60 % for ms merkel .
correspondents say conservative mps are not confident of victory under mr stoiber , but that most see him as the best chance they have of holding on to their seats .

police have long suspected that the infamous kray twins committed more murders than those for which they were imprisoned for life in 1969 .
an inquest at the time concluded frances kray had committed suicide .
bradley allardyce says that reggie 's wife frances was forced by his brother ronnie to take the pills that killed her .
gangland murder bradley allardyce was released from prison three years ago after serving nine years for armed robbery .
he spent three of those years in maidstone prison , four cells along the landing from reggie kray .
kray , who died two years ago , was serving life for the murder of jack " the hat " mcvitie .
ronnie kray was openly gay kray and allardyce both denied they were more than just friends .
but allardyce told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " i am openly admitting for the first time that we had a sexual relationship as much as it was against my will and he knew it was against my will .
" so i was always in denial . "
but he added : " there is not one day i would change with mine and reggie 's relationship . "
the pair spent most of their time at maidstone in each other 's company .
kray confidences allardyce revealed that on one night in prison reggie kray revealed to him the crime that haunted him the most - the apparent suicide of his first wife .
" i was sitting in my cell with reg and it was one of those nights where we turned the lights down low and put some nice music on and sometimes he would reminisce .
when -lsb- frances -rsb- first came onto the scene the first reaction from ronnie was jealousy , sheer and utter jealousy maureen flanagan family friend " he would get really deep and open up to me .
" he suddenly broke down and said ' i 'm going to tell you something i 've only ever told two people and something i 've carried around with me ' - something that had been a black hole since the day he found out .
" he put his head on my shoulder and told me ron killed frances .
he told reg what he had done two days after . "
maureen flanagan , a frequent visitor to the kray home and their mother 's hairdresser , also visited the twins in prison and later helped arrange their funerals .
inseparable bond she believes kray loved allardyce .
" i think it started off with companionship and i think it grew into a love .
" there was definitely a bond there which was probably inseparable .
reggie kray married while in prison but was bisexual " i do n't think he gave it to anybody else for the rest of his life . "
flanagan was also close to the girl who became reggie 's first wife .
" when she first came onto the scene the first reaction from ronnie was jealousy , sheer and utter jealousy .
" someone else is coming in to separate them two - he did not want to be separated . "
the krays ' years of crime were ended by a team of scotland yard detectives led by leonard " nipper " read , who thinks the allegations should be investigated .
" whatever else it is it is an allegation of murder - somebody has made an extreme allegation .
" if this had been reported to me at the stage i was at that time , investigating the whole area of what the krays might be up to it would have gone into the scale of allegations that must be pursued and that would have been pursued with vigour .
" it would have added weight to the allegation that these were indiscriminate murders . "
all of the protagonists , except allardyce , are dead , but scotland yard have told today they will investigate .

the us defence secretary , donald rumsfeld , contradicting the red cross , said the 20 taleban and al-qaeda captives " will be handled not as prisoners of war , because they 're not , but as unlawful combatants " .
prison conditions individual cells measuring 1.8 by 2.4 metres cells partly open to elements , with walls of chain-link fence camp has barbed wire fences , watchtowers and floodlights surrounded by marshes and shark-infested sea but he insisted the prisoners - who are under heavy guard - would be treated humanely and within the terms of the geneva conventions .
the prisoners were transferred aboard a cargo plane to a temporary site - called camp x-ray - at the us guantanamo bay military base on friday .
they will be kept separate , in cells measuring 1.8 by 2.4 metres -lrb- six feet by eight feet -rrb- with open , chain-link walls , a concrete floor and wooden roof .
the human rights group amnesty international has voiced concern about the " cages " used for accommodation , saying they would " fall below minimum standards for humane treatment " .
cuban co-operation despite years of hostility , the cuban government has said it will help the us authorities at guantanamo bay .
" we are willing to co-operate with the medical services required as well as with sanitation programmes in the surrounding areas under our control , " an official statement said .
cuba said it differed from the united states on the method but not on the need to " eradicate terrorism " .
the prisoners arrived with hands bound and some with shackles on their legs .
some appeared to resist as they got off the plane .
they were dressed in orange jumpsuits , orange caps , white shoes and wore goggles covered with tape .
they also wore surgical masks as some prisoners had tested positive for tuberculosis and at least one prisoner was sedated .
the international red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- says it regards the prisoners as pows with full rights under the geneva conventions .
the icrc says it plans to start visiting the prisoners early next week to ensure they are being treated humanely .
amnesty international said that " all those in us custody following the military operations in afghanistan must be treated humanely , with full respect for international standards " .
military tribunals none of the prisoners has yet been charged but some could face military courts authorised by president george bush following the 11 september attacks .
a new prison is being built at guantanamo bay to hold up to 2,000 prisoners behind razor wire .
experts say the use of guantanamo is carefully calculated - it is technically cuban territory , leased to the us military - and if the detainees are never brought to american soil , they can have no recourse to appeals under us federal law .
the landing was witnessed by about two dozen journalists , but the us military enforced strict media controls - banning all photographs and recordings of the transfer .
the detainees , who arrived from kandahar , were described by task force commander marine brigadier general michael lehnert as the " worst elements " of the al-qaeda terrorist network .
the extraordinary security measures have been put in place amid fears of a prisoner uprising such as happened at mazar-e-sharif in afghanistan .
icrc delegates have so far visited nearly 5,000 prisoners in about 40 facilities in afghanistan , and the humanitarian organisation says it will expect the same free access to prisoners in cuba .

a poll by nfo system three for the herald newspaper found that 37 % of scots favoured adopting the single currency , compared with 42 % who were against .
this five-point difference is in stark contrast to the 22 % lead held by eurosceptics in a similar survey in july last year .
the poll also showed that 22 % of scots are undecided about whether to support or reject the euro if a referendum was held .
the easiest way to find out the truth would be to hold the real referendum and let all the people have their say conservative party spokesman nfo system three interviewed 1,063 people in 41 scottish parliamentary constituencies from 3 to 9 january .
the scottish national party 's economy spokesman andrew wilson said scots were increasingly recognising the benefits of the euro .
" this is an argument that is there to be won , " he said .
" but above all they are recognising that sterling offers the worst of all worlds for scotland . "
however , a conservative spokesman said : " all the opinion polls suggest support for the pound is stronger in scotland than in the rest of the uk .
" the easiest way to find out the truth would be to hold the real referendum and let all the people have their say . "
the poll follows similar surveys in other european countries that have opted out of the euro - denmark and sweden - which indicate opposition to the single currency is falling .
a similar poll by nop for the channel 4 powerhouse programme earlier this week concluded that the number of british people against membership had dropped from 50 % to 43 % over the past year .
half of those surveyed said they would be persuaded to support the currency if it was given strong backing by business and government .
in denmark , which rejected the euro in a referendum , a recent poll recorded the highest-yet level of support for the currency .
it found 57 % of people would vote to join the european monetary union , with 34 % opposed and 9 % undecided .

"
the main challenger to president robert mugabe in the zimbabwean presidential election says he welcomes the european union 's pressure for international observation of the poll .
he has no option but to allow an international assessment of the election to give it legitimacy opposition leader morgan tsvangirai the eu has given harare a week to accept foreign media and international monitors .
but the government has said it will allow international observers to witness the election in march - but not to monitor it .
morgan tsvangirai - leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- - told the bbc that the eu ultimatum was a " step forward " .
no sanctions speaking after a day of intense talks with representatives of the european union , zimbabwean foreign minister stanislav mudenge said he would issue invitations to observers shortly .
but mr tsvangirai said president mugabe could not afford to reject the monitors .
" he has no option but to allow an international assessment of the election to give it legitimacy .
he needs that legitimacy . "
correspondents say observers can only watch the conduct of the election , whereas monitors can intervene where they suspect unfair polling procedures .
the eu warned zimbabwe to halt political violence in the run-up to the 9-10 march elections .
i will invite observers but there will be no monitors - nobody monitors zimbabwe stan mudenge but its statement made no mention of imposing sanctions on the country as previously threatened .
mr tsvangirai said there was no time in the next two months for sanctions to have any impact on zimbabwe 's voters - political and diplomatic pressure was necessary .
international criticism after the meeting , zimbabwean foreign minister mudenge also attacked the british government , accusing it of trying to unseat president robert mugabe .
further criticism of zimbabwe has come from the united states , which said the authorities were trying to intimidate opposition supporters .
us state department spokesman richard boucher said five opposition supporters had been killed in the past two weeks , and there was little prospect of the murders being investigated .
and south africa described as unacceptable an army statement indicating it would not accept an election victory by the opposition .
the zimbabwean parliament has just approved new legislation banning independent monitors , and is expected next week to push through a bill on control of the media .
eu not happy the eu issued a statement saying it was not satisfied that its concerns about violence in the run-up to presidential ballots would be addressed by harare .
but the bbc 's janet barrie in brussels says some critics feel the eu has responded far too slowly to the situation in zimbabwe , and that too little was achieved today , too late .
eu foreign ministers are due to review progress at their next meeting in brussels in late january , but there was no mention of the action that might be taken if harare failed to provide a satisfactory response to the concerns about the elections .
