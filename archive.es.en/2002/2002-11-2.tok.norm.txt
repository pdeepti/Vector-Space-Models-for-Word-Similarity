nearly 500,000 people log on to play each week .
they are mostly in the us at the moment but , with the european servers due to go online on 21 november , the craze is bound to continue spreading like wildfire .
with some people spending as much time playing this game as they do going to work , just what is it about everquest that has made it such a hit ?
" everquest has managed to capture people 's imaginations very strongly with a massively multiplayer environment , " said neil turner , an everquest game moderator .
" so you 're speaking , adventuring and fighting with real people all over the world at any time . "
real but make-believe if the rest of world has gone online looking for adventure , i decided it was about time i followed them to see what is going on .
the first step was to load up the software , no mean feat in itself as it comes on six disks and there is still a massive download to get all the game files up-to-date .
having registered my account it was time to create my character , which is a fairly complex procedure that will determine what skills , inclinations and alliances you will make once you arrive in norrath .

members of the conservation charity plantlife met at the coed y felin nature reserve near hendre in flintshire to safeguard the deptford pink .
the deptford pink needs open conditions and lots of sun with plenty of areas for it to feed into dr trevor dines plantlife conservationists are working to clear scrubland in the area , creating conditions in which the plant can flourish .
although european versions of the plant can be bought from garden centres , the welsh variety of the deptford pink is close to being wiped out .
the shrub is one of the fastest-declining plants in britain and plantlife is keen to protect its existence .
the organisation 's wales officer dr trevor dines led the project on saturday , along with staff from the north wales wildlife trust .
the botanist said he believed the site in north east wales was one of the few left in the country .
" in 1994 , a local recorder for plantlife discovered thousands of this plant growing on this steep slope , " he said .
the plant has a delicate pink flower " their numbers have declined in recent years and a survey earlier this year found only three flowering plants remained at the site .
" the conditions have become worse now , and we have pulled up brambles and gorse so it can thrive .
" the deptford pink needs open conditions and lots of sun . "
the plants - which have delicate pink flowers - are protected by law , so members of the public are not allowed to remove them .
experts hope that , by disturbing the habitat and soil , the seed from the deptford pink will be brought to the surface .
this will encourage the seeds to grow in the cleared area .

the government of the united states will not look the other way as threats gather against the american people dick cheney the vice-president was speaking to republican party supporters at an election rally in denver , colorado .
mr cheney was there to lend his support to senator wayne allard , the incumbent republican who is facing a strong challenge from the democratic party contender , tom strickland .
this race could determine which party controls the us senate .
warning iraq and its weapons of mass destruction have not figured prominently in this mid-term election campaign .
it is the economy , housing , health care and a range of domestic issues that are uppermost in voters ' minds .
nonetheless , mr cheney used this rally in the key state of colorado to repeat the bush administration 's tough line on iraq in uncompromising terms .
he said that wars were not won on the defensive and that america had to pre-empt serious threats before they materialised .
" saddam hussein harbours terrorists and the instruments of terror , " mr cheney said .
senator wayne allard has got top support " he is pressing forward with weapons of mass destruction and has already used them against the iranians and against his own people .
the government of the united states will not look the other way as threats gather against the american people . "
stressing the long-term nature of the battle against terrorism , mr cheney noted that america was still closer to the beginning of this conflict than to its end .
close call on the domestic front , the vice-president put forward a strong defence of the bush administration 's tax cuts , insisting that jobs could only be created when americans were able to keep more of the money they earned , and he described the current democratic leadership of the senate as dysfunctional .
the message went down well in a hall full of republican true believers .
