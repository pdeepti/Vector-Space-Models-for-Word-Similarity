fisheries minister elliot morley said the 54th annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- , which will discuss managing the world 's whale population , would be " very difficult " .
mr morley also admitted he was concerned about the continuing accusations of vote-buying which have been levelled at japan , which is hosting the summit in the whaling port of shimonoseki .
there are fears the recent rush of interest among some countries wanting to join the iwc may be motivated by japanese interest in resuming whale hunting for profit .
before flying out to shimonoseki , mr morley told a london press conference : " there have been widespread accusations of japan buying votes .
" the countries concerned deny that they are being bought up by japan .
" japan denies it 's doing it and you have to accept what people say on face value .
" but there are concerns about the link between japan and some of these countries . "
' slow death ' the iwc outlawed commercial hunting of whales in 1985/86 , but japan continues to conduct whaling for scientific research purposes .
whale meat still ends up in japanese supermarkets .
japan announced this year it planned to extend scientific whaling to kill an additional 50 minke and up to 50 sei whales , which conservationists say are endangered .
campaigners such as greenpeace have long accused japan of persuading smaller countries , such as carribean islands , to vote with them in exchange for fisheries aid .
it also claims japan has recruited new iwc members on that basis , spending a total of $ 323m in aid between 1987 and 1999 .
iwc anti-whalers uk usa germany netherlands australia new zealand brazil argentina last year a japanese minister admitted using overseas aid to secure support for its campaign to have the international ban on whaling lifted , but this was denied by his government .
mr morley said : " the uk and japan work closely on many environmental issues from climate change to forestry and conservation - but we are poles apart on whaling .
" this is not about cultural differences , it is not about the west trying to impose its beliefs , it is about conservation , animal welfare and the exploitation of the marine environment . "
he said the iwc 's estimate in 1992 of 760,000 minke whales in the southern ocean had fallen dramatically , but without explanation . "
whaling is cruel , unnecessary and difficult to condone at any level " elliot morley mp uk fisheries minister mr morley added : " there is no consistently reliable , quick and easy way to ensure that whales are killed instantaneously .
" it can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours for a whale to die once it has been harpooned .
" these are highly intelligent , sociable creatures .
whaling is cruel , unnecessary and difficult to condone at any level . "
' cultural differences ' japan maintains that the whale population has recovered sufficiently for commercial whaling to resume and says opposition to eating whales is due to cultural differences .
a japanese government spokeswoman said : " continuation of the moratorium on commercial whaling , particularly in light of the adoption of the revised management procedure and the robust status of some whale stocks , is contrary to the object and purpose of the international convention for the regulation of whaling . "
" respect for cultural differences must also be properly taken into account , " she said .
other issues to be debated at the iwc include the preservation of whaling sanctuaries , particularly in the indian ocean .

the challenge facing aol time warner 's richard parsons is enormous .
richard parsons has already listed his first goal as aol time warner 's new chief executive : " restore our credibility with investors " .
that 's a pretty tough call considering the string of broken promises and escalating losses that shareholders have had to absorb lately .
we believe the key is to instil a more sober and disciplined mentality paul kim kaufman brothers aol time warner is a sprawling media giant , with interests ranging from cable channels like cnn to time magazine and film studios making box office hits like lord of the rings .
in the first three months of this year , it racked up one of the highest quarterly losses in history , making a record $ 54bn -lrb- £ 37bn -rrb- write-down .
the write-down is basically an admission that the firm 's assets are worth far less today than was claimed yesterday .
shrinking savings meanwhile , the synergies promised at the time of the mega-merger between aol and time warner have failed to materialise .
when media group time warner agreed to merge with internet leader aol more than two years ago , the combined firms were worth $ 290bn .
mr parsons is seen as a safe pair of hands and many analysts saw it as a marriage made in heaven , with the biggest internet service provider set to empower the established giant of traditional information and entertainment .
since then , more than $ 200bn of investors ' money has evaporated .
now the 54 year old mr parsons , one of the most prominent african-american businessman , shoulders the responsibility of winning back the trust of his investors .
the dot.com blip analysts are already enthusiastic , touting him as a " safe pair of hands " and the man to set more realistic goals than his predecessor , jerry levin .
the 63 year old mr levin , an ardent enthusiast of all things internet , leaves the firm still singing the praises of the merger he created at the height of the dot.com boom .
mr levin is still singing the praises of the merger he forged " although it 's the current fashion for some to diminish the significance of the internet , digital media will continue to utterly reconfigure the entire communications industry , " he said last month .
and he optimistically claimed that the spectacular crash of the dot-com bubble could look like nothing more than a blip in the long-term .
safe and sober mr parsons has more of a blue-chip background , arriving at time warner by way of government service and banking , after training as a lawyer .
" with the lofty promises of the merger now a distant memory and now a remote possibility , we believe the key is to instil a more sober and disciplined mentality and focus on core competencies , " said kaufman brothers ' paul kim in a recent research note .
it is this new sober and disciplined tone that investors and analysts expect to hear reflected as the new boss addresses the annual general meeting on thursday .
he will have to outline a strategy to tackle the anaemic advertising markets and the slowdown in the firm 's aol online unit , the unit which has previously been one of the more profitable parts of the overall business .
" the african-american journey is a saga of faith , persistence and hard work , " mr parsons said earlier this year , speaking at a celebration of black history .
his new job seems likely to require similar endurance .

president fox : concerned about " serious disruption " to world agricultural markets the exchanges , described as very frank , took place during the annual ministerial meeting of the oecd , which represents 30 of the world 's most developed countries .
the us will face more pressure on thursday , when trade will top the agenda of this two-day meeting .
the us has been left in no doubt over the anger and disappointment felt by many of its partners following us president george w bush 's decision to impose duties on steel imports and , just this week , to allow hefty subsidies for us farmers .
unfair measures belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who chaired the meeting , said it would be hard to sum up all the words used to condemn us actions .
he said american mid-term elections were no excuse for unfair measures which risked widening the gap between rich and poor countries .
by blocking access to developed markets , he warned that wealthy nations will continue to sow the seeds of hate against themselves .
that theme was picked up by mexican president vicente fox , the oecd 's only latin american member .
' tit for tat ' fear speaking in the european parliament , he warned that us farm subsidies risked serious disruption to world agricultural markets .

the exchanges , described as very frank , took place during the annual ministerial meeting of the oecd , which represents 30 of the world 's most developed countries .
the us will face more pressure on thursday , when trade will top the agenda of this two-day meeting .
the us has been left in no doubt over the anger and disappointment felt by many of its partners following us president george w bush 's decision to impose duties on steel imports and , just this week , to allow hefty subsidies for us farmers .
unfair measures belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who chaired the meeting , said it would be hard to sum up all the words used to condemn us actions .
he said american mid-term elections were no excuse for unfair measures which risked widening the gap between rich and poor countries .
by blocking access to developed markets , he warned that wealthy nations will continue to sow the seeds of hate against themselves .
that theme was picked up by mexican president vicente fox , the oecd 's only latin american member .
' tit for tat ' fear speaking in the european parliament , he warned that us farm subsidies risked serious disruption to world agricultural markets .
many of america 's trading partners clearly believe its actions go against the spirit of commitments made at the world trade talks in doha last year .
and with the european union seeking to impose retaliatory sanctions for us steel tariffs , the fear is that those negotiations could become poisoned by a series of tit-for-tat responses .

glasgow 's festival of football ended with a 2-1 victory for the spanish giants , the ninth time they have lifted the trophy .

strathclyde police praised the conduct of both sets of fans and said there was no real trouble before or after the game .

the match was watched by king juan carlos of spain as well as the german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
hampden stadium was packed with 52,000 supporters for the showpiece final which was preceded by a day of festivities in the city .
rival fans generated a carnival atmosphere ahead of the match and police commended their good-natured behaviour .
officers also got into the spirit of things on the streets when they posed for photos with spanish and german fans - and allowed some of them on their motorbikes and others to try on their hats .
about 3,000 fans of all ages were kept entertained in george square by various activities laid on by the tournament sponsors , including video games , computer skills tests and video footage of some of the highlights from the competition 's colourful history .

the proclaimers continued the ceremony 's authentic scottish flavour , which also saw pipe bands and dancers entertain the crowds .

the streaker then got down on one knee and waved to the crowd before being escorted from the pitch by police to a round of applause from fans .

"
if the economic tests are in the right place , if the tests are met , then it is overwhelmingly in this country 's interests to join " tony blair in an interview with the bbc 's newsnight , the prime minister gave the clearest indication yet that a euro vote will be held next year .
mr blair reiterated that the treasury 's five economic tests on euro entry would be decided upon by june 2003 .
if the tests are met , he said , the issue would be " put to the people " .
' ground being prepared ' downing street says there is nothing new in the comments .
but the pro-euro britain in europe group they were mr blair 's " strongest euro signal yet " and a " significant development " in the debate . "
it is high time he -lrb- mr blair -rrb- got on with it " lord heseltine conservative former minister lord brittan said : " the ground is clearly being prepared . "
former deputy prime minister lord heseltine said : " it has been reported this week that the prime minister 's pollsters have told him that he can win a referendum on whether britain should join the euro .
" it will surprise no one when i say i have always thought that he could win and that it is high time he got on with it . "
' get on with it ' liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said mr blair 's comments were " very significant " . "
joining the euro now would destabilise the economy " ian davidson , labour mp " it 's much further than the prime minister has gone before .
" let 's just hope that tony blair has the active support of his chancellor this time .
" we need a clear timetable for a referendum and we need it as soon as possible .
let 's get on with it . "
earlier , 32 labour mps tabled a commons motion calling for an " early " referendum .
' destabilising ' euro but the anti-euro ' no ' campaign poured scorn on mr blair 's insistence on the five economic tests .
campaign director george eustice said : " if tony blair tries to take britain into the euro it will be for political not economic reasons . "
but he added : " any claim that the tests have been met will be fiercely contested . "
labour mp ian davidson said : " there 's no way anyone can claim the tests have been met ' clearly and unambiguously ' as the treasury have said they must .
" joining the euro now would destabilise the economy - and that means a return to boom and bust and higher unemployment . "
brown discussions in the second of three set-piece interviews with jeremy paxman on wednesday , the prime minister refused to be " tied down " to a specific timetable for holding a referendum .
" i ca n't start specifying to you the weeks or months in which that will happen , " mr blair said .
" but i do n't think there 's an issue about a gap ... once the tests are passed , then it is in the interests of your economy , so we believe you go in . "
he said he discusses the progress being made with chancellor gordon brown " all the time " .
' closer together ' mr paxman asked if he wanted to go down in history as the prime minister who surrendered the pound .
mr blair replied : " i would have no problem with history recording me as the person who said to the british people , ' it is in our interests for us to be a key and major player in europe and here is something that is in a single currency , is in our economic interests to do so ' . "
he said the world was " moving closer together " and there were 10 countries queuing up to get inside the european union .
but he stressed the economics had to be right for british entry to the euro because it was an " economic union " .
political reasons mr blair said he was a " huge supporter " of britain 's relationship with the us but he thought the country 's " destiny " was as a " a leading player in europe " .
he said being a leading player in europe did not necessarily mean being a member of the euro .
but britain should not stay out of the euro for " political reasons " - to do so " would be a betrayal of our national interests " .
mr blair 's comments come as former conservative chancellor ken clarke launched a new pro-euro group of conservative mps .

the company said it had called off the flotation because it feared that gloomy investor sentiment would weigh on its share price .
the decision to scrap the flotation was announced on wednesday night , hours before trading in the company 's shares was due to start .
the cancelled punch flotation , which follows a disappointing stock market launch last week from music retailer hmv , could cast doubt over a string of initial public offerings planned over the summer .
difficult conditions about 100 companies have announced plans to go public in the coming months , including betting shop chain william hill and clothes retailer burberry .
hmv shares , which the company had hoped would trade within a range of between 190p and 220p , received a lukewarm reception this week , closing at just 174.75p on wednesday .
volatile trading amid continuing uncertainty over future economic prospects has made the current market environment hostile to new share issues .
the number of new public offerings has fallen sharply since the global stock market boom of the late 1990s came to an end in early 2000 .
fund raising punch taverns , the uk 's second biggest pub group with 4,300 licenses premises , had hoped to raise about £ 250m from its flotation .
the stock market launch would have valued the company at about £ 700m if mid-range share price targets had been met .
entrepreneur hugh osmond created punch in 1997 after buying up the pubs business of former brewer bass .
two years later , punch snapped up allied domecq 's pubs after a protracted bidding war with brewer whitbread .

the company said it had called off the flotation because it feared that gloomy investor sentiment would weigh on its share price .
the decision to scrap the flotation was announced on wednesday night , hours before trading in the company 's shares was due to start .
the cancelled punch flotation , which follows a disappointing stock market launch last week from music retailer hmv , could cast doubt over a string of initial public offerings planned over the summer .
difficult conditions about 100 companies have announced plans to go public in the coming months , including betting shop chain william hill and clothes retailer burberry .
hmv shares , which the company had hoped would trade within a range of between 190p and 220p , received a lukewarm reception this week , closing at just 174.75p on wednesday .
volatile trading amid continuing uncertainty over future economic prospects has made the current market environment hostile to new share issues .
the number of new public offerings has fallen sharply since the global stock market boom of the late 1990s came to an end in early 2000 .
fund raising punch taverns , the uk 's second biggest pub group with 4,300 licenses premises , had hoped to raise about £ 250m from its flotation .
the stock market launch would have valued the company at about £ 700m if mid-range share price targets had been met .
entrepreneur hugh osmond created punch in 1997 after buying up the pubs business of former brewer bass .
two years later , punch snapped up allied domecq 's pubs after a protracted bidding war with brewer whitbread .

former deputy prime minister lord heseltine said : " it has been reported this week that the prime minister 's pollsters have told him that he can win a referendum on whether britain should join the euro .
" it will surprise no one when i say i have always thought that he could win and that it is high time he got on with it . "

earlier , 32 labour mps tabled a commons motion calling for an " early " referendum .

kennedy : ' clear timetable is needed ' campaign director george eustice said : " if tony blair tries to take britain into the euro it will be for political not economic reasons . "
but he added : " any claim that the tests have been met will be fiercely contested . "
labour mp ian davidson said : " there 's no way anyone can claim the tests have been met ' clearly and unambiguously ' as the treasury have said they must .
