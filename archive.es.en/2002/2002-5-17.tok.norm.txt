speaking on the eve of its annual meeting , ebrd president jean lemierre told bbc news online that only by promoting the development of eastern europe could eu leaders tackle the growing fear of immigration that has led to the strong electoral showing of mr le pen in france and pim fortuyn 's party in the netherlands .
and he said that if the eu delayed further in admitting east european countries to membership it could lead to a serious setback in the reform process .
when asked what could be done to tackle the growth of the far right in european politics , mr lemierre responded vigorously .
' promote growth ' the process of reform is certainly driven by the european cause - the moment it is postponed there will be a lot of questions jean lemierre , president , ebrd " there are fears today .
the best way to make them increase is by not acting .
" if we do invest in the central european countries , if we do encourage their aspirations -lsb- for membership -rsb- , the situation will be easier .
" it is by promoting growth that we will address these fears . "
mr lemierre said that europeans should look towards the lessons of history .
twenty years ago , when spain and portugal joined the eu , there were fears of mass immigration to france and germany - but now those countries were attracting immigrants of their own .
membership fears the ebrd 's job is to aid the countries of eastern europe and the former soviet union with the transition to a market economy by encouraging private investment .
it has been closely involved with preparations for membership by the five most developed eastern european countries - poland , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , and slovenia - and the three baltic nations of estonia , latvia and lithuania , who are all expected to join the eu in 2004 .
mr lemierre warned that any further delay in the process - which has been underway since 1998 - could undermine the impetus for economic reform in eastern europe .
" the process of reform is certainly driven by the european cause .
" the moment it is postponed there will be a lot of questions . "
in its transition report , the ebrd said that economic growth was steady in the region - but warned that reforms like privatisation and budget restraint were under threat in hungary , poland and slovakia .
mr lemierre also believes that the backlash against immigration could affect the amount of eu aid that is promised to eastern europe .
difficult negotiations still lie ahead on the amount of agricultural and regional aid to be received by the new members , which could be at the expense of existing aid to eu members like greece , spain , and ireland .
russian reform mr lemierre was full of praise for the economic reforms promoted by the new president of russia , vladimir putin .
but he warned that russian companies needed to do more to encourage good corporate governance .
the ebrd has refused to invest in russia 's largest energy company , gazprom , because of worries over the treatment of minority shareholders .
mr lemierre said that " most major russian companies could attract private investors providing their corporate governance was better .
" there is an understanding that this is key to their future because they need to raise money . "
the ebrd said that the rapid growth of russia , fed by higher oil prices , was now slowing , and that a deeper commitment to reform was needed .
and it warned that , unlike central europe , foreign direct investment was unlikely to play as major a role in the reform process .
poor countries focus mr lemierre also welcomed a new focus on the region 's poorest countries , including albania , moldova , and some of the central asian republics .
he praised the uk international development secretary , clare short , for her imitative in focusing on these countries which " had previously been neglected , " and said that there could be no growth where there was so much poverty and gross inequality .
he said the ebrd stood ready to help by reducing its requirement for loan guarantees from the government budgets , and hoped that both official creditors - the paris club - and private bank lenders - the london club - would move to relieve the debt burden on these countries .
in total , the ebrd lent a record 3.3bn euros in 2001 .
mr lemierre says that in its decade of existence , the bank has generated 67bn euros of private investment in eastern europe , more than three times its own capital investment . watch / listen on this story ebrd 's jean lemierre ' there are weaknesses in the transition economies ' ebrd 's jean lemierre " we should try to make the future " ebrd 's jean lemierre " the process of reform is based on the cause of the eu . "
ebrd 's jean lemierre " good governance will attract more private investors . "

number 10 was forced to issue a denial after the off-the-record comments from mr byers were made public .
the five tests is it good for employment ?
what is the impact on our financial services industry ?
what will the effect be on investment is there sufficient flexibility to cope with the change ?
can convergence between the british and european currencies be sustained ?
both pro- and anti-euro conservatives have condemned labour 's policy on the single currency as confusing .
europe minister peter hain instead said the government was taking a sensible approach by waiting for five economic tests to be reached before calling a referendum .
the comments attributed to mr byers have fuelled speculation that the government is gearing up to hold a referendum next spring .
but downing street stressed there were no plans for legislation unless and until the treasury 's five economic tests were met . "
it will only be resolved when the prime minister gets off the fence and takes a very positive lead " lord heseltine tory leader iain duncan smith claimed the prime minister had sent his transport secretary to brief journalists that he would start the referendum process this autumn .
he said : " when that news broke the prime minister panicked and denied all knowledge .
" what a way to run a government .
more spin becomes more chaos . "
' common sense ' conservative shadow treasury minister john bercow called for a statement to parliament to clarify the situation .
former deputy prime minister lord heseltine , a supporter of the euro , accused downing street of " playing politics " .
he said its denial was " couched in exactly the same words that the prime minister used before the general election when he said there was n't going to be an increase in national insurance " .
speaking on bbc one 's question time , lord heseltine said mr blair would almost certainly have decided on a timetable for euro entry years ago .
he said : " this is a very serious issue of a massive importance to britain and it will only be resolved when the prime minister gets off the fence and takes a very positive lead . "
mr hain countered that attack , saying : " downing street was very clear this evening .
" it said you can not have legislation considered until the economic assessment has been made and nobody knows whether it will be made before or after the queen 's speech . "
but , he said , it will be made before june next year .
mr hain added : " we should just calm down consider the facts , consider the arguments and i think we are approaching it in a common sense way . "
' delicious irony ' liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said this time mr byers may have to pay with his job .
" the hapless stephen byers has been caught out once again , but this time for telling the truth , " he said .
mr campbell added : " it would be a delicious irony if mr byers were finally to lose his job on account of his truthfulness rather than for having misled the house of commons . "
mr byers was reported to have said privately to journalists the legislation would be hurried through both the lords .
this would allow voters to have their say some time next year - with speculation mounting of a 1 may vote .
the " unveiling " of the timetable comes amid growing signs the government is gearing up for a full-blown pro-euro campaign .
tony blair made some of his most pro-single currency comments yet during his marathon interview with jeremy paxman for bbc 2 's newsnight on wednesday night .

if two people really want to adopt ... they should want to marry ann widdecombe , conservative mp the move has been personally supported by health secretary alan milburn , who says it is vital for more children to grow up in a stable family environment .
but conservative mp robert walter has laid down an amendment to these changes - to be voted on monday - which would specifically exclude gay people from the arrangement .
under current law , only married couples and single people , including gay people , are allowed to adopt .
impassioned debate earlier on thursday , a free vote on an amendment to the adoption and children bill was carried by a majority of 155 .
it is not about gay rights , it is not even about parents - it is about a child 's chance of a family jacqui smith , health minister the move aims to lift the ban on adoption by unmarried heterosexual and same sex couples but faces fierce opposition in the lords .
in impassioned debate on the change , labour 's david hinchliffe , chairman of the commons health select committee , denied it was an attempt to undermine marriage .
" i have a deeply held personal belief in marriage , " he said , stressing his one single concern was the interests of vulnerable children .
" parents should be married ' under present law , he said , " if the best interests of a particular child would be served by being adopted by an unmarried couple , this would not be allowed " .
but former conservative minister ann widdecombe argued that all parents should be legally married .
she said the legal responsibilities that come with marriage guaranteed children 's " stability " and " security " .
robert walter : amendment is not ' homophobic ' " if two people really want to adopt , if they are looking at the interests and security of that child , unless there is an impediment , they should want to marry , " she told mps .
not ' anti-gay ' tory spokesman tim loughton attacked mps for using the bill to promote a politically correct " gay rights agenda " .
the government should be putting the interests of the child first , not the wishes of the adult , he warned during a passionate speech .
" too many people interested in this part of the bill are in danger of putting the interest of adults ahead of the children , " he said .
the tories were not " anti-gay or pro marriage " but believed marriage provided the best foundations for adoption , he added .
' political correctness ' health minister jacqui smith said the measures were about increasing the potential pool of adopters - not the right to adopt .
the bill was about providing a stable family home for children , which did not necessarily mean with a married couple .
she added : " in the end this is not a debate about a right to adopt , it is not about political correctness , it is not about gay rights , it is not even about parents - it is about a child 's chance of a family . "
single people it is suggested that the courts allow an unmarried couple to adopt when they are 21-years-old or older .
the courts must be satisfied of the long-term nature of the couple 's commitment to one another .
there must be provision to ensure the financial and practical security of the children in case the couple split up .
at present , a single person can adopt but an unmarried couple can not adopt as partners .
tory opposition liberal democrat health spokesman evan harris argued that unmarried couples , including gays , should be allowed to adopt , especially as individual gays could do so under existing laws .
scientific research showed children fared much better when adopted by unmarried , including same sex couples , than in care , he added .
it is estimated that some 5,000 children nationwide are waiting for a home with an adoptive family .
the bill also sets tough penalties for those who avoid new safeguards when adopting from overseas , following the notorious kilshaw case , where a british couple got around rules by going abroad . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's mark d 'arcy " the idea of unmarried adoption was eventually agreed by a majority " jim richards , director , catholic children 's society " cohabitations on the whole do n't last very long " felicity collier , uk assoc of adoption and fostering " this is n't a vote about the value of marriage " vote should gay couples be allowed to adopt ?

she added : " in the end this is not a debate about a right to adopt , it is not about political correctness , it is not about gay rights , it is not even about parents - it is about a child 's chance of a family . "

the courts must be satisfied of the long-term nature of the couple 's commitment to one another .
there must be provision to ensure the financial and practical security of the children in case the couple split up .
at present , a single person can adopt but an unmarried couple can not adopt as partners .
tory opposition liberal democrat health spokesman evan harris argued that unmarried couples , including gays , should be allowed to adopt , especially as individual gays could do so under existing laws .
scientific research showed children fared much better when adopted by unmarried , including same sex couples , than in care , he added .

"
if two people really want to adopt ... they should want to marry " ann widdecombe , conservative mp the move has been personally supported by health secretary alan milburn , who says it is vital for more children to grow up in a stable family environment .
but conservative mp robert walter has laid down an amendment to these changes - to be voted on monday - which would specifically exclude gay people from the arrangement .
under current law , only married couples and single people , including gay people , are allowed to adopt .
impassioned debate earlier on thursday , a free vote on an amendment to the adoption and children bill was carried by a majority of 155 . "
it is not about gay rights , it is not even about parents - it is about a child 's chance of a family " jacqui smith , health minister the move aims to lift the ban on adoption by unmarried heterosexual and same sex couples but faces fierce opposition in the lords .
in impassioned debate on the change , labour 's david hinchliffe , chairman of the commons health select committee , denied it was an attempt to undermine marriage .
" i have a deeply held personal belief in marriage , " he said , stressing his one single concern was the interests of vulnerable children .
" parents should be married ' under present law , he said , " if the best interests of a particular child would be served by being adopted by an unmarried couple , this would not be allowed " .
but former conservative minister ann widdecombe argued that all parents should be legally married .
she said the legal responsibilities that come with marriage guaranteed children 's " stability " and " security " .
" if two people really want to adopt , if they are looking at the interests and security of that child , unless there is an impediment , they should want to marry , " she told mps .
not ' anti-gay ' tory spokesman tim loughton attacked mps for using the bill to promote a politically correct " gay rights agenda " .
the government should be putting the interests of the child first , not the wishes of the adult , he warned during a passionate speech .
" too many people interested in this part of the bill are in danger of putting the interest of adults ahead of the children , " he said .
the tories were not " anti-gay or pro marriage " but believed marriage provided the best foundations for adoption , he added .
