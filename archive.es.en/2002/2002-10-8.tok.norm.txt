survivors of the disaster at harrow and wealdstone station in north-west london , in which 112 people died , were at the service at holy trinity church in wealdstone .
on the morning of 8 october 1952 a london-bound express train missed a yellow signal and ploughed into the back of a stationary local train , then a third train crashed into the wreckage .
a plaque in memory of the dead was unveiled and all 112 names were read out in front of survivors and representatives of the rail industry .
at the service was gilbert powell , 64 , who was just 14 when he broke off his journey to school to spend hours helping to rescue people from the wreckage .
he was a boy scout travelling on a bus to willesden technical college when he saw the extent of the crash and decided to help .
mr powell worked with a doctor and a nurse and was even lowered down by rope to see if anyone was alive within the wreckage .
he said : " i saw some pretty awful sights .
i must have worked for hours and i 've really no idea how many people i helped . "
parishioners killed another memorial service was held at christ church in watford , on sunday .
many of those killed had been parishioners at the church who had boarded at watford junction .
a total of 108 passengers and four rail crew were killed and nearly 350 people injured .
the worst uk rail accident was in 1915 at quintinshill , in scotland , when a passenger train collided with a wooden train carrying troops .
fire swept through the troop train and more than 200 people were killed .

the pioneering £ 7.7m complex , at holsworthy , north devon , has won the uk euro solar award for 2002 for its builders , german-based farmatic uk .
the plant runs on around 1.6m tons of slurry collected each year from 30 local farmers .
at full capacity , it will produce around 1.4 megawatts of power .
slurry for the station comes from local farms the accolade was awarded by energy 21 , a branch of the euro solar educational charity , which creates awareness and understanding of renewable energy .
the plant started producing electricity for the national grid earlier this year .
slurry is fermented in two digesters and produces methane gas to power turbines to produce electricity .
the plant 's processes also produce hot water for domestic use .
the plant was funded with a european grant of over £ 3.5m , as well as money from farmatic .
there has been wide interest in the plant from across uk , and farmatic said it was hoping to establish others around the country .
global priority the company said : " what we are doing is very safe and a lot of people have shown an interest in the uk , but they are waiting to see this one running first .
" we hope to build at least 100 farms in the uk . "
energy 21 said : " power generation can not rely indefinitely on sources of energy such as provided by coal , gas , oil and nuclear fuels .
" to solve these issues , a shift to methods of producing heat and electricity that do not compromise the environment and the needs of future generations is a global priority . "
dung-fuelled power stations are popular in both germany and denmark , with about 20-large scale plants operating in each country .

he will adapt a controversial book of the same name - an insider account of violence organised by hardcore bluebirds fans .
the book 's authors - and former hooligans - tony rivers and david jones will reportedly reap a five-figure sum from a deal with trainspotting star robert carlyle 's production company 4way pictures . "
hooliganism is being glorified by the media yet again and we 're not pleased - there is no organised trouble at cardiff " vince alm , cardiff city supporters club chair but city fans have already leapt on the proposal , fearing it will further hurt their club 's reputation for hooliganism and glamorise violence .
welsh and carlyle researched the production while at the club 's ninian park ground in september for a game .
the book adaptation could be perfect material for the writer , whose work tends to chronicle urban male society 's dark , violent and druggy underbelly .
" soul crew " was the name adopted by travelling cardiff city supporters in the 1980s and continues to refer to the club 's troublesome minority element .
recently , eight fans were jailed for their part in violence which erupted outside ninian park after a crucial play-off defeat in may .
there were also ugly scenes on the pitch following the bluebirds ' fa cup win over leeds .
club chief sam hammam has promised to " change the biggest nutters " in the thug element .
' misrepresenting fans ' published in march , the soul crew book lifted the lid on the small section of hardcore perpetrators whose actions continue to dog the club .
it has sold 20,000 copies .
the authors say the film adaptation will offer a true-life portrayal of football violence - just as trainspotting did for the lives of deprived urban heroin-users .
but cardiff city supporters club is furious at the expected representation of bluebirds ' violence .
city are looking good for division one promotion and perhaps an even more glittering future with premiership status .
" hooliganism is being glorified by the media yet again and we 're not pleased , " club chair vince alm told bbc news online .
" there is no organised trouble at cardiff - nothing goes on .
the film will misrepresent fans - we 're not raving lunatics .
" the book was n't a brilliant read .
if this film comes out , it will sour relations with police forces and we will have to start all over again . "
" thuggery " he said a tough accord agreed between the club and south wales police - as well as further contact with uk police - would be ruined by the continued portrayal of cardiff fans as violent thugs .
the film would up the ante , encouraging rival hooligan groups around the uk to claim the soul crew 's scalp at violent meetings , he said .
the film project has been criticised by cardiff north mp julie morgan who said she feared the film " might make legends out of what is basically thuggery " .
" my fear is that it would glamorise the soul crew and give the story publicity that we do not really want .
" it could cause further problems for cardiff city and for the image of cardiff .
but the book 's author 's have defended their decision to cooperate with the film producers .
tony rivers said : " i do n't think a film that comes out now or in a couple of years is going to affect cardiff city or cardiff . "

sunsets are early and quick on the equator - like a garage door slamming shut .
by 1915 , the muddy valley outside nairobi is already submerged in darkness .
it is a dangerous time .
muggers and pickpockets mingle with the crowds heading home quickly along narrow alleys , jumping nimbly across open sewers , their paths occasionally lit by the lamps and candles of stall owners selling fruit and fried fish .
" do you want to meet a drug dealer ? " asks john - the young football coach who 's agreed to guide me round kibera with his friend isaac .
joint-maker we squelch and duck and feel our way along the alleys .
or rather i do .
john and isaac seem to know every ditch and every scrap of jagged metal .
a rat scuffles past my foot .
round one corner , we almost stumble on top of an old man , squatting in the path .
tom moya is busy rolling joints when we arrive - lining them up on a wooden box into piles of 10 .
he lives in tiny smoke-filled room , lined with cardboard .
in the dark corners , half-naked white women smile from the torn pages of magazines .
there 's a sign on a chest of drawers which reads : " real women do n't hit men . "
tom does n't sell hard drugs .
just marijuana - or bhang , as it 's called here .
" i used to collect fares on a matatu , " he says , licking the edge of the cigarette paper .
" now i do this .
that 's poverty for you . "
matatus are the overcrowded minibuses which tear round nairobi with a death wish .
most have strange , macho names painted on the sides - kosovo conflict is a current favourite .
death wish and death warrant are old classics .
" this job sounds a bit safer , " i suggest to tom .
" yup .
but the pay is worse .
and the police still hassle you .
they come in maybe once a week asking for money - i give them 100 shillings and they go away . "
at that moment , two boys come in and sit down next to me on a filthy old sofa .
then three more crowd in .
they 're all 12 or 13 years old .
a joint works its way slowly round the room .
rastas " relaxation , " says samuel mwangi , in his best rasta accent .
the others grin - and punch each others ' fists in a salute .
samuel is 13 .
a high price is extracted by both muggers and the police he 's wearing flip-flops and shorts .
" school ?
yeah i go to school sometimes , " he says .
but he 's an orphan , and he sleeps at his grandmother 's home just along the alley .
often there is n't enough money to pay the school fees .
or buy dinner .
his friends all chime in , looking at me andtrying not to grin : " yeah we have n't eaten dinner either .
maybe you could buy us something ! "
a few minutes later , the tallest boy in the room passes a joint to his neighbour , stands up and declares : " we are his majesty 's boys . "
that , it turns out , is the name of their football team - his majesty being the rastafarian icon haile selassie .
then samuel takes a long puff on the joint and starts lecturing me about dreadlocks .
" god gave you hair , and you must n't shave it . "
" but you have , " i say , pointing to his closely cropped head .
" yes , " he says , patiently , leaning back on the sofa , " but i 'm a cub scout . "
john is n't a fan of the rastafarians .
" they 're a bad influence , " he says , when we 're outside again .
" they just smoke , and try to look cool .
but we 're coaching his majesty 's boys at football - trying to keep them busy , and away from the rastas . "
chang 'aa the slum is getting quieter now - the music has stopped .
the lights of nairobi glitter in the distance .
the soft light from a paraffin lamp catches john 's teeth as he grins and says : " now , how about some home brew ... "
and so our slum pub crawl moves on to another dark wooden hut .
inside , evelyn , tonica and orasa giggle and start clearing the tiny room .
evelyn makes room for us , by leaning over and picking up two small children who are sleeping on the floor .
they both wake up and stare quietly at me , then crawl into a corner .
chang 'aa is a spirit , usually distilled from maize or sorghum .
the good stuff is not unlike vodka .
the bad stuff can be topped up with methanol - last year more than 100 people died in nairobi from one particularly lethal brew .
i let john go first .
he swigs it back from what looks like a shampoo bottle .
" good stuff , " he says , through clenched teeth - and passes it to me .
and he 's right .
sort of .
it 's like dirty brandy .
the sisters have lived here for seven years now .
like most people in kibera , they came from the countryside , not far from lake victoria , hoping to find jobs .
evelyn sits on the bed , watching us quietly .
one of the children - three-year-old marcus - is hers .
but there 's no father about .
orasa takes 50 shillings from me for the drink , and goes outside to buy some milk for the kids .
brewing chang 'aa is illegal in kenya .
so the police come to collect a bribe once in a while .
they pester us , says evelyn .
sometimes they stay for an hour or two ...
i 'd already guessed that the sisters were prostitutes .
all three of them , working together in the one room - the sleeping children pushed out of sight into the corner .
the youngest sister , tonica , does n't look more than 14 herself .
john tells me later that she 's the big attraction .
" men are attracted by her youth , " he says .
they spend an evening with the sisters , drink chang 'aa , have sex , then fall asleep .
the women steal a little extra money from their pockets . "
danger two dogs follow us , as we walk back up the hill towards the railway line .
we turn a corner , and a drunk man lurches into us .
he 's got a bandage wrapped round one hand , and a rotten avocado in the other .
i can sense john and isaac tense up , then relax as the man stumbles past .
" that fellow is the most dangerous man in kibera , " isaac says .
" even when he 's drunk .
i 've seen him take on four people .
he 's crazy . "
in the dark , we can see small groups moving along a path , maybe 20 yards away .
" muggers , " john whispers .
" it 's nearly 11 - this is when they go off to the estates , looking for people coming out of bars . "
just then , four men turn and head towards us .
" do n't worry , i recognise these guys , " john says , stepping forward to punch fists , rasta-style .
we all follow suit .
the men move off , laughing , walking along the railway track .
we stand for a while , looking back down the hill towards nairobi .
the clouds have cleared , and the sky is cold and full of stars .
" good , " says isaac .
" no rain tonight , so no burglars in the slum . "
" it 's the noise , " he explains .
" the sound of rain on all those tin roofs .
you can shout all you like , but no-one will hear you . "

the millionth customer of high-speed net access was connected up in the last week according to the department of trade and industry .
the numbers of people and businesses signing up for broadband has trebled since the start of 2002 .
oftel estimates that 20,000 connections per week are being installed .
before now many studies have shown that britain has lagged behind the us and much of europe in the numbers of people signed up to the speedy services .
speed freaks broadband replaces relatively slow dial-up modem net access , which runs at a maximum of 56 kilobits per second , with a service that can run up to 10 times faster .
even better , broadband is effectively always on so there is no need to dial-up to access it .
in the uk most people currently get broadband access via cable suppliers such as ntl and telewest , although the numbers using adsl , which comes via phone lines , is rapidly catching up .

" it took five years for the uk to see a million people using mobile phones , " said e-commerce minister stephen timms .
" at this pace , the uk is well on its way to being the most extensive and competitive market for broadband in the world . "
limited choice but dti figures reveal that the uk has some way to go before broadband reaches its full potential audience .
the department said that currently 63 % of the population have access to a broadband service , but only 40 % have a choice of suppliers .
bt recently introduced a system that promised to bring broadband to areas that do not have it , if local residents could show there was enough interest .
the initiative has already led to some telephone exchanges being connected up to broadband services .
a study by the organisation for economic co-operation and development released this week showed that broadband is being taken up by consumers faster in the uk than in france or germany .

a commission set up by the firm found bertelsmann rode the rise of the nazi party to restructure itself from a religious and school book publisher to supply millions of anti-semitic texts .
i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history gunther thielen bertelsmann " bertelsmann published a variety of papers and books that clearly had anti-jewish bias , " independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- chairman saul friedlaender , an israeli historian , told a news conference .
the ihc found bertelsmann had targeted the youth market with its " exciting stories " series and the " the christmas book of the hitler youth " annual which pushed its sales up 20 fold .
the ihc said the company 's " legend " that it was a victim of the nazis was a lie .
faking it the nazis shut down the company in 1944 , but probably because of war shortages rather and not because of subversive texts , it said .
" in 1945 , the legend that c. bertelsmann was closed down because of resistance to the nazis smoothed the way for the occupation authorities promptly granting the firm a new licence to publish , " the report said .
the commission found that bertelsmann made " indirect " use of jewish slave labour in latvia , and lithuania but not at its german headquarters .
the then head of the company , heinrich mohn , also made donations to the ss , hitler 's special forces and concentration camp guards .
" true , he never joined the nazi party , but his membership in the ss patrons ' group signalled his readiness for a political arrangement , " the report said .
the company had close ties to the nazi regime , particularly the propaganda ministry , and printed 19 million books during world war ii , making it the largest publisher for the german army .
the company immediately issued a statement apologising for its wartime activities and false corporate history .
" the values of bertelsmann then are irreconcilable with the company today .
the company is now a global player in the media industry , " tim arnold , the corporate secretary of bertelsmann told the bbc 's today programme .
sorry bertelsmann chairman gunther thielen said the company accepted the commission 's findings .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war two era as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " he said in a statement .
mr thielen said all the material used for the 800-page report would be made publicly available .
bertelsmann used its " revised " history when it took over the biggest us book publisher random house in 1998 .
the commission of four historians was set up in the fallout of the takeover after media reports on bertelsmann 's nazi past .
about 6,000 german companies are contributing to a 5.1bn euro -lrb- $ 5bn -rrb- settlement with hundreds of thousands of nazis slave labourers .
other companies , such as deutsche bank and dresdner bank have also set up commissions into history during the third reich . watch / listen on this story tim arnold , corporate secretary , bertelsmann " the values of bertelsmann then are irreconcilable with the company today . "

a merger between the two companies would have created europe 's 12th biggest bank , with a market value of about £ 15bn -lrb- $ 21bn -rrb- .
the rejection came a day after bank of ireland confirmed press reports that the two firms had begun talks about a possible tie-up .
in a statement to the london stock exchange , abbey national has said its board had unanimously concluded the proposal was not in the best interests of its shareholders .
dublin hq bank of ireland had proposed the creation of one merged company , with its head office in dublin and its main stock market listing in london .
however , analysts believe abbey 's rejection of bank of ireland 's suit is unlikely to be the end of the story as other bidders may emerge .
abbey 's shares have fallen dramatically in the last year , making it a takeover target .
news of bank of ireland 's approach sent abbey 's shares leaping upwards by 8 % to 545 on monday afternoon , while in dublin , bank of ireland stock was fell 7.5 % to 9.40 euros .
windfall investors bruised abbey national has been struggling to restore investor confidence after suffering a series of embarrassing setbacks earlier this year .
in june , the bank warned the city that profits would fall short of expectations , blaming a series of risky corporate loans .
the news dragged abbey 's share price sharply lower , and led to the resignation of its chief executive ian harley the following month .
abbey stock was under pressure again last week , falling to seven-year lows amid speculation that the company is nursing losses in its wholesale banking division .
the fall in the company 's share price has wiped millions off the value of institutional investors ' holdings .
it has also affected millions of ordinary account holders who were handed a free stake in the former building society when it converted to a publicly listed company in 1989 .
succession of suitors abbey has been seen as a likely candidate for a merger or takeover for the last two years .
a planned tie-up with bank of scotland fell through last year , and a hostile takeover attempt by lloyds tsb was blocked on competition grounds .
this summer , abbey was reported to be holding merger talks with national australia bank , which already owns the clydesdale , yorkshire , and northern banks in the uk .
abbey has yet to appoint a new chief executive .
according to one report , the current finance director stephen hester is expected to be given the job within the next two weeks .

by any measure , it has been a pretty bloody beginning to the conference week .
the so-called big beasts have ambled out of their undergrowth to savage the leadership .
and iain duncan smith 's poll ratings have got worse - a feat many believed impossible .
but , in a surprise development , party chairman -lrb- her choice of title -rrb- theresa may made an astonishing , possibly even unique , speech .
never before has a tory conference been subjected to such a blunt and critical free character reading .
she may lack the fire of a margaret thatcher , but her words were , in one senior backbencher 's words " revolutionary " .
new era if her speech has set the tone for the rest of the conference - particularly iain duncan smith 's make-or-break speech - then we are in for fireworks .
she , in effect , told her party to pull itself together , accept it had acted in an unforgivable manner in the past , and agree the need to drag itself into a new era .
she even promised positive discrimination for minority election candidates as a necessary evil .
it offered no concessions to the " rockers " in the party demanding adherence to old values and images .
instead it handed the mantle to the " mods " who are determined to modernise the party and make it more inclusive and tolerant .
if her speech set the tone , then shadow health secretary liam fox set the agenda with radical plans to devolve power to hospitals .
his plans for all hospitals to become foundation hospitals , combined with policies to allow parents huge power over schools , marks the new thinking in the duncan smith-led party .
perhaps things at this conference really can only get better .
tuesday 's theme will be " helping the vulnerable . "
all eyes will be on former chairman david davis as he makes his conference speech on regional government .
will he deliver any coded messages about the leadership ?
he will be followed by shadow work and pensions secretary david willets under the theme " renewing one nation " in which he will focus on poverty and opportunity after 50 .
there will also be debates on domestic violence and world poverty led by caroline spelman .
the highlight is expected to be shadow chancellor michael howard 's speech on the economy in the early evening .
the tories might be trying to broaden their appeal , but according to shadow home secretary oliver letwin , you have to draw the line somewhere .
speaking at a fringe meeting about the need to recruit more women to stop the party looking " weird " , he dashed the hopes of transsexual tories everywhere by saying he was only interested in the real thing , as it were .
" we do n't want people to engage in sex changes and appear as women , " mr letwin joked .
undoubtedly theresa may who delivered one of the straightest-talking speeches to conference anyone could remember for years .
a few sat stony faced as she laid into the tories who had let the party down - jeffrey archer and edwina currie were not actually named - and signalled positive discrimination towards women candidates .
few knew she had it in her .
edwina currie .
it 's probably as well she stayed away from the conference - she might have been lynched if she had turned up .
her book revealing details of her four-year affair with john major is being outsold 25 to one by ann widdecombe 's aptly titled " an act of treachery . "
some representatives have even considered organising a petition to have it banned from the politico 's bookshop which has a stall in the conference centre .
the seven year olds at a local school who , when asked by mr duncan smith what politicians did , answered : " argue . "
security is always tight at these events - and you never know who might end up getting frisked alongside you .
today it was shadow chancellor and former home secretary michael howard - the hardest man in the job until david blunkett came along .
something about him set the metal detectors off - a flick knife , his steel toe-caps , perhaps .
no , just his iron will to destroy chancellor gordon brown apparently .
ann widdecombe - currently the star of celebrity fat club - was being wined and dined in one of bournemouth 's finest italian restaurants on sunday night .
poor woman - if she thought she could sneak in a quick , calorie-filled pasta dish she was in the wrong place .
i counted at least eight pairs of journalistic eyes all focussed on her throughout the meal .
organisers are having second thoughts about their new-look set , or they should be .
it has only just dawned on them that every shadow minister who speaks from the podium on tuesday will do so under the huge banner declaring : " helping the vulnerable . "

" as a preference , honda would rather be in the euro , " managing director ken keir said in an interview with bbc news online ahead of the 10th anniversary of honda 's factory in swindon .
" but as a brit , it 's obvious it is down to the british people , " mr keir said .
" we will manage our business according to the british people 's wish . "
no fresh cash however , honda has previously made plenty of noise about the difficulties it faces due to the strength of the uk currency .
during the summer , the president of honda europe , minoru harada , said the pound would have to fall 15 % against the euro before the company 's uk manufacturing operations could return to profit .
last year , honda europe suffered losses of more than 300m euros -lrb- £ 189m ; 296m -rrb- , the majority at honda uk .
and success in europe remains honda 's biggest challenge , honda president hiroyuki yoshino said as he unveiled the company 's new accord at the paris motor show .
so it did not come as a massive surprise that when honda unveiled a three-year expansion plan during summer , there was no fresh investment destined for the uk .
trade union all has not been well at honda 's plant in swindon either , where relations between company bosses and workers - which honda prefers to call ' associates ' - appear to be strained .
honda has for years refused to recognise trade unions at its plant in swindon .
but late last year , about one in four of the workers voted in favour of being represented by unions .
and last month , union members threatened to strike over a demand for full negotiating rights .
" we said we would recognise -lsb- last year 's -rsb- vote and we 're in very amicable discussions with the unions now about coming to an agreement on a relationship , " mr keir said .
any agreement between honda and local union representatives could prove controversial if , as is expected , it includes a clause which makes it compulsory to settle disputes through arbitration rather than strike action .
other japanese car makers in the uk have previously entered into similar no-strike agreements with unions .
still in the red but despite all this , mr keir insisted that honda is here to stay .
" the exchange rate and everything else made it tough , " mr keir acknowledged .
but he added : " you do n't spend £ 1.15bn and not consider it a long-term investment . "
mr keir said he expects honda europe to be profitable " within the next two to three years " .
fresh investment mr keir 's comments suggest that honda has dramatically changed its tune .
the car maker has previously blamed the strong pound and the weak euro for its widening losses and for previous cut-backs in swindon .
in november 2000 , honda even said it would not build a new manufacturing plant in the uk because of currency concerns .
but within a year , it had done so anyway .
exporting to japan last september , honda threw open the doors to a second car factory in swindon - the first new car plant to be built in the uk in eight years .
the new factory brought honda 's investment in swindon to £ 1.5bn and its workforce to more than 4,500 people .
since then , honda swindon has raised production to 130,000 cars a year , with the goal of boosting it further to 200,000 , mr keir said .
" we are now exporting cars to the us and back to japan , so we can manage the business and , obviously where possible , counter any exchange rate difficulties , " said mr keir .
honda exports its sports utility vehicle cr-v to the us and its civic cars to both the us and japan , as well as its exports to continental europe and the middle east .
