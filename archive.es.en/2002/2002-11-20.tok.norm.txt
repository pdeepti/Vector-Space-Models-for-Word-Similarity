you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .
but when it comes to the so-called " cheap " flag countries - where ship registration is subjected to fewer fees and regulations - such measures are not a matter of course .
and in the case of prestige , a greek shipping company was sailing under the flag of the bahamas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ecological disaster imminent as tanker sinks around 77,000 tons of oil could escaped from the stricken vessel " prestige " after it sank off the northwestern spanish coast .
the ensuing disaster could be even worse than the 1989 exxon valdez catastrophe off alaska .
-lrb- nov .
19 , 2002 -rrb- oil continues to spill as blame is passed the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .
but when it comes to the so-called " cheap " flag countries - where ship registration is subjected to fewer fees and regulations - such measures are not a matter of course .

it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .

recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels . turkey 's unofficial new leader , recep tayyip erdogan , meets german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday night as part of a major diplomatic offensive to promote his country 's accession to the european union . erdogan ’ s justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which scored a landslide victory two weeks ago , took office on monday . erdogan himself is banned from holding a formal post in the government because of a conviction for islamist sedition .
instead , the slot of prime minister has been filled by abdullah gul , who is considered a moderate in the party , which has links to political islam . but behind the scenes and abroad , erdogan appears to be calling the shots . with a decisive summit on eu expansion due to take place in copenhagen in less than four weeks , he is throwing the whole weight of his party ’ s electoral mandate behind him in an attempt to get a start date for talks on turkish membership . european leaders do n't rule out eu membership schröder has said germany wants to keep the door open for turkey to join the eu , although he is unwilling to commit himself to any timetable .
" europe has a fundamental interest in stopping such an important country as turkey from sliding into islamic fundamentalism , ” he told reporters last week , although he stressed that the final outcome would largely depend on the progress of human rights reforms in the country . other leaders are less cautious : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said after meeting erdogan last week the eu should not delay accession talks beyond 2003 . us tries to drum up support for important ally u.s. president george w. bush , with an eye firmly on ankara ’ s role in regional stability and as an ally in washington ’ s war against terror -lrb- and , potentially , iraq -rrb- , has also signalled american support for turkey ’ s candidature . on monday , bush called danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen ´ , currently the eu 's rotating president , to press his case . afterwards , the white house announced the two men “ agreed on the historic and strategic importance of advancing turkey ’ s evolution toward the european union and the importance of the copenhagen summit in that regard . ” the case against turkey in europe many europeans are still not convinced turkey belongs in the eu at all .
most of the leaders of germany ’ s conservative opposition share the opinion of the former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the head of the working group drafting an eu constitution , d 'estaing recently sparked off a major international row after asserting that turkey is not geographically or culturally european and that its accession would signify " the end of the european union . " roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , agrees . " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that 's a european tradition , ” he told deutsche welle last week .
“ of course , we ca n't blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we must n't ignore that fact , " he said . even if he does manage to extract enough commitments to support turkey ’ s candidacy , erdogan still could find it is not enough to tip the balance .
the akp ’ s roots in two outlawed islamist parties and his own conviction for alleged sedition means the new government - turkey ’ s first single-party government in 15 years - will be viewed with suspicion in many quarters . a sticking point the other issue is cyprus .
u.n. efforts to reunite the island are in danger of stalling because , so far at least , only the greek cypriot side has declared its willingness to negotiate .
erdogan recognizes that turkey ’ s case with the eu would be greatly strengthened if he could bring the turkish cypriots to the negotiating table and withdraw the 30,000 troops ankara has kept on the island since the 1974 invasion .
but he admits that might not happen in time for the copenhagen summit , which begins dec .

" europe has a fundamental interest in stopping such an important country as turkey from sliding into islamic fundamentalism , ” he told reporters last week , although he stressed that the final outcome would largely depend on the progress of human rights reforms in the country . other leaders are less cautious : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said after meeting erdogan last week the eu should not delay accession talks beyond 2003 . us tries to drum up support for important ally u.s. president george w. bush , with an eye firmly on ankara ’ s role in regional stability and as an ally in washington ’ s war against terror -lrb- and , potentially , iraq -rrb- , has also signalled american support for turkey ’ s candidature . on monday , bush called danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen ´ , currently the eu 's rotating president , to press his case . afterwards , the white house announced the two men “ agreed on the historic and strategic importance of advancing turkey ’ s evolution toward the european union and the importance of the copenhagen summit in that regard . ” the case against turkey in europe many europeans are still not convinced turkey belongs in the eu at all .
most of the leaders of germany ’ s conservative opposition share the opinion of the former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the head of the working group drafting an eu constitution , d 'estaing recently sparked off a major international row after asserting that turkey is not geographically or culturally european and that its accession would signify " the end of the european union . " roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , agrees . " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that 's a european tradition , ” he told deutsche welle last week .
“ of course , we ca n't blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we must n't ignore that fact , " he said . even if he does manage to extract enough commitments to support turkey ’ s candidacy , erdogan still could find it is not enough to tip the balance .
the akp ’ s roots in two outlawed islamist parties and his own conviction for alleged sedition means the new government - turkey ’ s first single-party government in 15 years - will be viewed with suspicion in many quarters . a sticking point the other issue is cyprus .
u.n. efforts to reunite the island are in danger of stalling because , so far at least , only the greek cypriot side has declared its willingness to negotiate .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .

european union defense officials say their rapid reaction force can be deployable within a year .
but the u.s. and great britain want europe 's soldiers to serve nato , not the eu . seeking to assuage concerns across the atlantic that it ’ s not taking enough military responsibility , europe ’ s defense ministers announced tuesday that a european army could be deployed within the next year . the european rapid reaction force will most likely not be ready at the beginning of 2003 , as originally planned , but could fully take over nato ’ s mandate in macedonia as early as the middle of next year , said german defense minister peter struck . the announcement that the 60,000-strong force is deployable comes at a time when the united states and great britain are pushing europe to form a similar force for nato on the eve of a historic alliance summit in prague . washington , wary of the european union ’ s bureaucratic density , would prefer to have the military alliance directing a european special force ’ s deployments . but european countries , like france , want an eu-led force to distinguish itself from the american-led nato alliance . others are concerned the two forces could overlap . german foreign minister joschka fischer told the german parliament last week there “ should be no doubling up . ” enough soldiers , not enough equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 15 members of the european union can together provide 100,000 troops , 400 combat aircraft , and 100 ships to use in a rapid reaction force , according to european union defense documents .
troops , then , don ’ t seem to be the issue .
equipment , like transport planes , heavy lifts and communications networks , is . the eu currently relies heavily on nato to provide that equipment .
joint plans to build military transport planes , like the airbus a400 , won ’ t be completed until 2008 .
an eu force , the way france envisaged , would be independent of nato and therefore not dependent on the united states ’ military assets . “ if the u.s. is occupied with other operations , there ’ s no guarantee those assets would be available , ” said daniel keohane , a senior analyst at the center for european reform in london in an interview . finding a purpose for nato but washington wants to see nato and europe more closely intertwined .
the 21,000 strong rapid reaction force would give new purpose to an alliance that is experiencing an identity crisis in the post-cold war world . " nato must transition from an organisation that was formed to meet the threats from a warsaw pact , to a military organisation structured to meet the threats from global terrorists , " u.s. president george w. bush told reporters in prague on wednesday . should it not , warn analysts , it will risk losing the interest of the united states . “ nato hasn ’ t been offering anything that is so useful to the americans recently , ” said keohane .
“ if the u.s. is not very interested in nato then that doesn ’ t bode well for the future of the alliance . ” two forces , same soldiers keohane shares the opinion of many european officials that the two forces can co-exist peacefully and cooperatively . " if it can be managed properly -lrb- the nato force -rrb- can raise the bar for the eu force , " keohane said .
" you 're reducing duplication . " greek defense minister yannos papantoniou , whose country was originally against the european union force , said the two forces will “ complement ” each other . ” europe can sustain both , ” and train people “ to partake in both , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany closes the defense wallet germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .
the five other stadiums will all require partial reconstruction totaling 568.2 million euro -lrb- $ 575.2m -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup , www-links fifaworldcup.com fifa , the world 's soccer authority , presents world cup news from the past , present and future .

recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels . turkey 's unofficial new leader , recep tayyip erdogan , meets german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday night as part of a major diplomatic offensive to promote his country 's accession to the european union . erdogan ’ s justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which scored a landslide victory two weeks ago , took office on monday . erdogan himself is banned from holding a formal post in the government because of a conviction for islamist sedition .
instead , the slot of prime minister has been filled by abdullah gul , who is considered a moderate in the party , which has links to political islam . but behind the scenes and abroad , erdogan appears to be calling the shots . with a decisive summit on eu expansion due to take place in copenhagen in less than four weeks , he is throwing the whole weight of his party ’ s electoral mandate behind him in an attempt to get a start date for talks on turkish membership . european leaders do n't rule out eu membership schröder has said germany wants to keep the door open for turkey to join the eu , although he is unwilling to commit himself to any timetable .
" europe has a fundamental interest in stopping such an important country as turkey from sliding into islamic fundamentalism , ” he told reporters last week , although he stressed that the final outcome would largely depend on the progress of human rights reforms in the country . other leaders are less cautious : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said after meeting erdogan last week the eu should not delay accession talks beyond 2003 . us tries to drum up support for important ally u.s. president george w. bush , with an eye firmly on ankara ’ s role in regional stability and as an ally in washington ’ s war against terror -lrb- and , potentially , iraq -rrb- , has also signalled american support for turkey ’ s candidature . on monday , bush called danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen ´ , currently the eu 's rotating president , to press his case . afterwards , the white house announced the two men “ agreed on the historic and strategic importance of advancing turkey ’ s evolution toward the european union and the importance of the copenhagen summit in that regard . ” the case against turkey in europe many europeans are still not convinced turkey belongs in the eu at all .
most of the leaders of germany ’ s conservative opposition share the opinion of the former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the head of the working group drafting an eu constitution , d 'estaing recently sparked off a major international row after asserting that turkey is not geographically or culturally european and that its accession would signify " the end of the european union . " roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , agrees . " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that 's a european tradition , ” he told deutsche welle last week .
“ of course , we ca n't blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we must n't ignore that fact , " he said . even if he does manage to extract enough commitments to support turkey ’ s candidacy , erdogan still could find it is not enough to tip the balance .
the akp ’ s roots in two outlawed islamist parties and his own conviction for alleged sedition means the new government - turkey ’ s first single-party government in 15 years - will be viewed with suspicion in many quarters . a sticking point the other issue is cyprus .
u.n. efforts to reunite the island are in danger of stalling because , so far at least , only the greek cypriot side has declared its willingness to negotiate .
erdogan recognizes that turkey ’ s case with the eu would be greatly strengthened if he could bring the turkish cypriots to the negotiating table and withdraw the 30,000 troops ankara has kept on the island since the 1974 invasion .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .
but when it comes to the so-called " cheap " flag countries - where ship registration is subjected to fewer fees and regulations - such measures are not a matter of course .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .
the five other stadiums will all require partial reconstruction totaling 568.2 million euro -lrb- $ 575.2m -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup , www-links fifaworldcup.com fifa , the world 's soccer authority , presents world cup news from the past , present and future .

the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .

european union defense officials say their rapid reaction force can be deployable within a year .
but the u.s. and great britain want europe 's soldiers to serve nato , not the eu . seeking to assuage concerns across the atlantic that it ’ s not taking enough military responsibility , europe ’ s defense ministers announced tuesday that a european army could be deployed within the next year . the european rapid reaction force will most likely not be ready at the beginning of 2003 , as originally planned , but could fully take over nato ’ s mandate in macedonia as early as the middle of next year , said german defense minister peter struck . the announcement that the 60,000-strong force is deployable comes at a time when the united states and great britain are pushing europe to form a similar force for nato on the eve of a historic alliance summit in prague . washington , wary of the european union ’ s bureaucratic density , would prefer to have the military alliance directing a european special force ’ s deployments . but european countries , like france , want an eu-led force to distinguish itself from the american-led nato alliance . others are concerned the two forces could overlap . german foreign minister joschka fischer told the german parliament last week there “ should be no doubling up . ” enough soldiers , not enough equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 15 members of the european union can together provide 100,000 troops , 400 combat aircraft , and 100 ships to use in a rapid reaction force , according to european union defense documents .
troops , then , don ’ t seem to be the issue .
equipment , like transport planes , heavy lifts and communications networks , is . the eu currently relies heavily on nato to provide that equipment .
joint plans to build military transport planes , like the airbus a400 , won ’ t be completed until 2008 .
an eu force , the way france envisaged , would be independent of nato and therefore not dependent on the united states ’ military assets . “ if the u.s. is occupied with other operations , there ’ s no guarantee those assets would be available , ” said daniel keohane , a senior analyst at the center for european reform in london in an interview . finding a purpose for nato but washington wants to see nato and europe more closely intertwined .
the 21,000 strong rapid reaction force would give new purpose to an alliance that is experiencing an identity crisis in the post-cold war world . " nato must transition from an organisation that was formed to meet the threats from a warsaw pact , to a military organisation structured to meet the threats from global terrorists , " u.s. president george w. bush told reporters in prague on wednesday . should it not , warn analysts , it will risk losing the interest of the united states . “ nato hasn ’ t been offering anything that is so useful to the americans recently , ” said keohane .
“ if the u.s. is not very interested in nato then that doesn ’ t bode well for the future of the alliance . ” two forces , same soldiers keohane shares the opinion of many european officials that the two forces can co-exist peacefully and cooperatively . " if it can be managed properly -lrb- the nato force -rrb- can raise the bar for the eu force , " keohane said .

it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .

recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels . turkey 's unofficial new leader , recep tayyip erdogan , meets german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday night as part of a major diplomatic offensive to promote his country 's accession to the european union . erdogan ’ s justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which scored a landslide victory two weeks ago , took office on monday . erdogan himself is banned from holding a formal post in the government because of a conviction for islamist sedition .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .
but when it comes to the so-called " cheap " flag countries - where ship registration is subjected to fewer fees and regulations - such measures are not a matter of course .
and in the case of prestige , a greek shipping company was sailing under the flag of the bahamas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ecological disaster imminent as tanker sinks around 77,000 tons of oil could escaped from the stricken vessel " prestige " after it sank off the northwestern spanish coast .
the ensuing disaster could be even worse than the 1989 exxon valdez catastrophe off alaska .

19 , 2002 -rrb- oil continues to spill as blame is passed the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame .

it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .

european union defense officials say their rapid reaction force can be deployable within a year .
but the u.s. and great britain want europe 's soldiers to serve nato , not the eu . seeking to assuage concerns across the atlantic that it ’ s not taking enough military responsibility , europe ’ s defense ministers announced tuesday that a european army could be deployed within the next year . the european rapid reaction force will most likely not be ready at the beginning of 2003 , as originally planned , but could fully take over nato ’ s mandate in macedonia as early as the middle of next year , said german defense minister peter struck . the announcement that the 60,000-strong force is deployable comes at a time when the united states and great britain are pushing europe to form a similar force for nato on the eve of a historic alliance summit in prague . washington , wary of the european union ’ s bureaucratic density , would prefer to have the military alliance directing a european special force ’ s deployments . but european countries , like france , want an eu-led force to distinguish itself from the american-led nato alliance . others are concerned the two forces could overlap . german foreign minister joschka fischer told the german parliament last week there “ should be no doubling up . ” enough soldiers , not enough equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 15 members of the european union can together provide 100,000 troops , 400 combat aircraft , and 100 ships to use in a rapid reaction force , according to european union defense documents .
troops , then , don ’ t seem to be the issue .
equipment , like transport planes , heavy lifts and communications networks , is . the eu currently relies heavily on nato to provide that equipment .

european union defense officials say their rapid reaction force can be deployable within a year .
but the u.s. and great britain want europe 's soldiers to serve nato , not the eu . seeking to assuage concerns across the atlantic that it ’ s not taking enough military responsibility , europe ’ s defense ministers announced tuesday that a european army could be deployed within the next year . the european rapid reaction force will most likely not be ready at the beginning of 2003 , as originally planned , but could fully take over nato ’ s mandate in macedonia as early as the middle of next year , said german defense minister peter struck . the announcement that the 60,000-strong force is deployable comes at a time when the united states and great britain are pushing europe to form a similar force for nato on the eve of a historic alliance summit in prague . washington , wary of the european union ’ s bureaucratic density , would prefer to have the military alliance directing a european special force ’ s deployments . but european countries , like france , want an eu-led force to distinguish itself from the american-led nato alliance . others are concerned the two forces could overlap . german foreign minister joschka fischer told the german parliament last week there “ should be no doubling up . ” enough soldiers , not enough equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 15 members of the european union can together provide 100,000 troops , 400 combat aircraft , and 100 ships to use in a rapid reaction force , according to european union defense documents .
troops , then , don ’ t seem to be the issue .
equipment , like transport planes , heavy lifts and communications networks , is . the eu currently relies heavily on nato to provide that equipment .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .
the five other stadiums will all require partial reconstruction totaling 568.2 million euro -lrb- $ 575.2m -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup , www-links fifaworldcup.com fifa , the world 's soccer authority , presents world cup news from the past , present and future .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .

it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .

it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .

european union defense officials say their rapid reaction force can be deployable within a year .
but the u.s. and great britain want europe 's soldiers to serve nato , not the eu . seeking to assuage concerns across the atlantic that it ’ s not taking enough military responsibility , europe ’ s defense ministers announced tuesday that a european army could be deployed within the next year . the european rapid reaction force will most likely not be ready at the beginning of 2003 , as originally planned , but could fully take over nato ’ s mandate in macedonia as early as the middle of next year , said german defense minister peter struck . the announcement that the 60,000-strong force is deployable comes at a time when the united states and great britain are pushing europe to form a similar force for nato on the eve of a historic alliance summit in prague . washington , wary of the european union ’ s bureaucratic density , would prefer to have the military alliance directing a european special force ’ s deployments . but european countries , like france , want an eu-led force to distinguish itself from the american-led nato alliance . others are concerned the two forces could overlap . german foreign minister joschka fischer told the german parliament last week there “ should be no doubling up . ” enough soldiers , not enough equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 15 members of the european union can together provide 100,000 troops , 400 combat aircraft , and 100 ships to use in a rapid reaction force , according to european union defense documents .
troops , then , don ’ t seem to be the issue .
equipment , like transport planes , heavy lifts and communications networks , is . the eu currently relies heavily on nato to provide that equipment .
joint plans to build military transport planes , like the airbus a400 , won ’ t be completed until 2008 .
an eu force , the way france envisaged , would be independent of nato and therefore not dependent on the united states ’ military assets . “ if the u.s. is occupied with other operations , there ’ s no guarantee those assets would be available , ” said daniel keohane , a senior analyst at the center for european reform in london in an interview . finding a purpose for nato but washington wants to see nato and europe more closely intertwined .
the 21,000 strong rapid reaction force would give new purpose to an alliance that is experiencing an identity crisis in the post-cold war world . " nato must transition from an organisation that was formed to meet the threats from a warsaw pact , to a military organisation structured to meet the threats from global terrorists , " u.s. president george w. bush told reporters in prague on wednesday . should it not , warn analysts , it will risk losing the interest of the united states . “ nato hasn ’ t been offering anything that is so useful to the americans recently , ” said keohane .
“ if the u.s. is not very interested in nato then that doesn ’ t bode well for the future of the alliance . ” two forces , same soldiers keohane shares the opinion of many european officials that the two forces can co-exist peacefully and cooperatively . " if it can be managed properly -lrb- the nato force -rrb- can raise the bar for the eu force , " keohane said .

recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels . turkey 's unofficial new leader , recep tayyip erdogan , meets german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday night as part of a major diplomatic offensive to promote his country 's accession to the european union . erdogan ’ s justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which scored a landslide victory two weeks ago , took office on monday . erdogan himself is banned from holding a formal post in the government because of a conviction for islamist sedition .
instead , the slot of prime minister has been filled by abdullah gul , who is considered a moderate in the party , which has links to political islam . but behind the scenes and abroad , erdogan appears to be calling the shots . with a decisive summit on eu expansion due to take place in copenhagen in less than four weeks , he is throwing the whole weight of his party ’ s electoral mandate behind him in an attempt to get a start date for talks on turkish membership . european leaders do n't rule out eu membership schröder has said germany wants to keep the door open for turkey to join the eu , although he is unwilling to commit himself to any timetable .
" europe has a fundamental interest in stopping such an important country as turkey from sliding into islamic fundamentalism , ” he told reporters last week , although he stressed that the final outcome would largely depend on the progress of human rights reforms in the country . other leaders are less cautious : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said after meeting erdogan last week the eu should not delay accession talks beyond 2003 . us tries to drum up support for important ally u.s. president george w. bush , with an eye firmly on ankara ’ s role in regional stability and as an ally in washington ’ s war against terror -lrb- and , potentially , iraq -rrb- , has also signalled american support for turkey ’ s candidature . on monday , bush called danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen ´ , currently the eu 's rotating president , to press his case . afterwards , the white house announced the two men “ agreed on the historic and strategic importance of advancing turkey ’ s evolution toward the european union and the importance of the copenhagen summit in that regard . ” the case against turkey in europe many europeans are still not convinced turkey belongs in the eu at all .
most of the leaders of germany ’ s conservative opposition share the opinion of the former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the head of the working group drafting an eu constitution , d 'estaing recently sparked off a major international row after asserting that turkey is not geographically or culturally european and that its accession would signify " the end of the european union . " roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , agrees . " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that 's a european tradition , ” he told deutsche welle last week .
“ of course , we ca n't blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we must n't ignore that fact , " he said . even if he does manage to extract enough commitments to support turkey ’ s candidacy , erdogan still could find it is not enough to tip the balance .
the akp ’ s roots in two outlawed islamist parties and his own conviction for alleged sedition means the new government - turkey ’ s first single-party government in 15 years - will be viewed with suspicion in many quarters . a sticking point the other issue is cyprus .
u.n. efforts to reunite the island are in danger of stalling because , so far at least , only the greek cypriot side has declared its willingness to negotiate .
erdogan recognizes that turkey ’ s case with the eu would be greatly strengthened if he could bring the turkish cypriots to the negotiating table and withdraw the 30,000 troops ankara has kept on the island since the 1974 invasion .
but he admits that might not happen in time for the copenhagen summit , which begins dec .

recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels . turkey 's unofficial new leader , recep tayyip erdogan , meets german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday night as part of a major diplomatic offensive to promote his country 's accession to the european union . erdogan ’ s justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which scored a landslide victory two weeks ago , took office on monday . erdogan himself is banned from holding a formal post in the government because of a conviction for islamist sedition .
instead , the slot of prime minister has been filled by abdullah gul , who is considered a moderate in the party , which has links to political islam . but behind the scenes and abroad , erdogan appears to be calling the shots . with a decisive summit on eu expansion due to take place in copenhagen in less than four weeks , he is throwing the whole weight of his party ’ s electoral mandate behind him in an attempt to get a start date for talks on turkish membership . european leaders do n't rule out eu membership schröder has said germany wants to keep the door open for turkey to join the eu , although he is unwilling to commit himself to any timetable .
" europe has a fundamental interest in stopping such an important country as turkey from sliding into islamic fundamentalism , ” he told reporters last week , although he stressed that the final outcome would largely depend on the progress of human rights reforms in the country . other leaders are less cautious : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said after meeting erdogan last week the eu should not delay accession talks beyond 2003 . us tries to drum up support for important ally u.s. president george w. bush , with an eye firmly on ankara ’ s role in regional stability and as an ally in washington ’ s war against terror -lrb- and , potentially , iraq -rrb- , has also signalled american support for turkey ’ s candidature . on monday , bush called danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen ´ , currently the eu 's rotating president , to press his case . afterwards , the white house announced the two men “ agreed on the historic and strategic importance of advancing turkey ’ s evolution toward the european union and the importance of the copenhagen summit in that regard . ” the case against turkey in europe many europeans are still not convinced turkey belongs in the eu at all .
most of the leaders of germany ’ s conservative opposition share the opinion of the former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the head of the working group drafting an eu constitution , d 'estaing recently sparked off a major international row after asserting that turkey is not geographically or culturally european and that its accession would signify " the end of the european union . " roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , agrees . " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that 's a european tradition , ” he told deutsche welle last week .
“ of course , we ca n't blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we must n't ignore that fact , " he said . even if he does manage to extract enough commitments to support turkey ’ s candidacy , erdogan still could find it is not enough to tip the balance .

european union defense officials say their rapid reaction force can be deployable within a year .
but the u.s. and great britain want europe 's soldiers to serve nato , not the eu . seeking to assuage concerns across the atlantic that it ’ s not taking enough military responsibility , europe ’ s defense ministers announced tuesday that a european army could be deployed within the next year . the european rapid reaction force will most likely not be ready at the beginning of 2003 , as originally planned , but could fully take over nato ’ s mandate in macedonia as early as the middle of next year , said german defense minister peter struck . the announcement that the 60,000-strong force is deployable comes at a time when the united states and great britain are pushing europe to form a similar force for nato on the eve of a historic alliance summit in prague . washington , wary of the european union ’ s bureaucratic density , would prefer to have the military alliance directing a european special force ’ s deployments . but european countries , like france , want an eu-led force to distinguish itself from the american-led nato alliance . others are concerned the two forces could overlap . german foreign minister joschka fischer told the german parliament last week there “ should be no doubling up . ” enough soldiers , not enough equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 15 members of the european union can together provide 100,000 troops , 400 combat aircraft , and 100 ships to use in a rapid reaction force , according to european union defense documents .
troops , then , don ’ t seem to be the issue .
equipment , like transport planes , heavy lifts and communications networks , is . the eu currently relies heavily on nato to provide that equipment .
joint plans to build military transport planes , like the airbus a400 , won ’ t be completed until 2008 .
an eu force , the way france envisaged , would be independent of nato and therefore not dependent on the united states ’ military assets . “ if the u.s. is occupied with other operations , there ’ s no guarantee those assets would be available , ” said daniel keohane , a senior analyst at the center for european reform in london in an interview . finding a purpose for nato but washington wants to see nato and europe more closely intertwined .
the 21,000 strong rapid reaction force would give new purpose to an alliance that is experiencing an identity crisis in the post-cold war world . " nato must transition from an organisation that was formed to meet the threats from a warsaw pact , to a military organisation structured to meet the threats from global terrorists , " u.s. president george w. bush told reporters in prague on wednesday . should it not , warn analysts , it will risk losing the interest of the united states . “ nato hasn ’ t been offering anything that is so useful to the americans recently , ” said keohane .
“ if the u.s. is not very interested in nato then that doesn ’ t bode well for the future of the alliance . ” two forces , same soldiers keohane shares the opinion of many european officials that the two forces can co-exist peacefully and cooperatively . " if it can be managed properly -lrb- the nato force -rrb- can raise the bar for the eu force , " keohane said .
" you 're reducing duplication . " greek defense minister yannos papantoniou , whose country was originally against the european union force , said the two forces will “ complement ” each other . ” europe can sustain both , ” and train people “ to partake in both , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany closes the defense wallet germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .

it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .

it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .
but both eichel and his french counterpart , francis mer , agreed last month that the credibility of the euro would be weakened if its two largest economies were seen to flout the deficit rule . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de black week for german chancellor the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .

european union defense officials say their rapid reaction force can be deployable within a year .
but the u.s. and great britain want europe 's soldiers to serve nato , not the eu . seeking to assuage concerns across the atlantic that it ’ s not taking enough military responsibility , europe ’ s defense ministers announced tuesday that a european army could be deployed within the next year . the european rapid reaction force will most likely not be ready at the beginning of 2003 , as originally planned , but could fully take over nato ’ s mandate in macedonia as early as the middle of next year , said german defense minister peter struck . the announcement that the 60,000-strong force is deployable comes at a time when the united states and great britain are pushing europe to form a similar force for nato on the eve of a historic alliance summit in prague . washington , wary of the european union ’ s bureaucratic density , would prefer to have the military alliance directing a european special force ’ s deployments . but european countries , like france , want an eu-led force to distinguish itself from the american-led nato alliance . others are concerned the two forces could overlap . german foreign minister joschka fischer told the german parliament last week there “ should be no doubling up . ” enough soldiers , not enough equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 15 members of the european union can together provide 100,000 troops , 400 combat aircraft , and 100 ships to use in a rapid reaction force , according to european union defense documents .
troops , then , don ’ t seem to be the issue .
equipment , like transport planes , heavy lifts and communications networks , is . the eu currently relies heavily on nato to provide that equipment .
joint plans to build military transport planes , like the airbus a400 , won ’ t be completed until 2008 .
an eu force , the way france envisaged , would be independent of nato and therefore not dependent on the united states ’ military assets . “ if the u.s. is occupied with other operations , there ’ s no guarantee those assets would be available , ” said daniel keohane , a senior analyst at the center for european reform in london in an interview . finding a purpose for nato but washington wants to see nato and europe more closely intertwined .
the 21,000 strong rapid reaction force would give new purpose to an alliance that is experiencing an identity crisis in the post-cold war world . " nato must transition from an organisation that was formed to meet the threats from a warsaw pact , to a military organisation structured to meet the threats from global terrorists , " u.s. president george w. bush told reporters in prague on wednesday . should it not , warn analysts , it will risk losing the interest of the united states . “ nato hasn ’ t been offering anything that is so useful to the americans recently , ” said keohane .
“ if the u.s. is not very interested in nato then that doesn ’ t bode well for the future of the alliance . ” two forces , same soldiers keohane shares the opinion of many european officials that the two forces can co-exist peacefully and cooperatively . " if it can be managed properly -lrb- the nato force -rrb- can raise the bar for the eu force , " keohane said .

recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels . turkey 's unofficial new leader , recep tayyip erdogan , meets german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday night as part of a major diplomatic offensive to promote his country 's accession to the european union . erdogan ’ s justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which scored a landslide victory two weeks ago , took office on monday . erdogan himself is banned from holding a formal post in the government because of a conviction for islamist sedition .
instead , the slot of prime minister has been filled by abdullah gul , who is considered a moderate in the party , which has links to political islam . but behind the scenes and abroad , erdogan appears to be calling the shots . with a decisive summit on eu expansion due to take place in copenhagen in less than four weeks , he is throwing the whole weight of his party ’ s electoral mandate behind him in an attempt to get a start date for talks on turkish membership . european leaders do n't rule out eu membership schröder has said germany wants to keep the door open for turkey to join the eu , although he is unwilling to commit himself to any timetable .
" europe has a fundamental interest in stopping such an important country as turkey from sliding into islamic fundamentalism , ” he told reporters last week , although he stressed that the final outcome would largely depend on the progress of human rights reforms in the country . other leaders are less cautious : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said after meeting erdogan last week the eu should not delay accession talks beyond 2003 . us tries to drum up support for important ally u.s. president george w. bush , with an eye firmly on ankara ’ s role in regional stability and as an ally in washington ’ s war against terror -lrb- and , potentially , iraq -rrb- , has also signalled american support for turkey ’ s candidature . on monday , bush called danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen ´ , currently the eu 's rotating president , to press his case . afterwards , the white house announced the two men “ agreed on the historic and strategic importance of advancing turkey ’ s evolution toward the european union and the importance of the copenhagen summit in that regard . ” the case against turkey in europe many europeans are still not convinced turkey belongs in the eu at all .
most of the leaders of germany ’ s conservative opposition share the opinion of the former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the head of the working group drafting an eu constitution , d 'estaing recently sparked off a major international row after asserting that turkey is not geographically or culturally european and that its accession would signify " the end of the european union . " roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , agrees . " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that 's a european tradition , ” he told deutsche welle last week .
“ of course , we ca n't blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we must n't ignore that fact , " he said . even if he does manage to extract enough commitments to support turkey ’ s candidacy , erdogan still could find it is not enough to tip the balance .
the akp ’ s roots in two outlawed islamist parties and his own conviction for alleged sedition means the new government - turkey ’ s first single-party government in 15 years - will be viewed with suspicion in many quarters . a sticking point the other issue is cyprus .
u.n. efforts to reunite the island are in danger of stalling because , so far at least , only the greek cypriot side has declared its willingness to negotiate .
erdogan recognizes that turkey ’ s case with the eu would be greatly strengthened if he could bring the turkish cypriots to the negotiating table and withdraw the 30,000 troops ankara has kept on the island since the 1974 invasion .
but he admits that might not happen in time for the copenhagen summit , which begins dec .

recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels . turkey 's unofficial new leader , recep tayyip erdogan , meets german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday night as part of a major diplomatic offensive to promote his country 's accession to the european union . erdogan ’ s justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which scored a landslide victory two weeks ago , took office on monday . erdogan himself is banned from holding a formal post in the government because of a conviction for islamist sedition .
instead , the slot of prime minister has been filled by abdullah gul , who is considered a moderate in the party , which has links to political islam . but behind the scenes and abroad , erdogan appears to be calling the shots . with a decisive summit on eu expansion due to take place in copenhagen in less than four weeks , he is throwing the whole weight of his party ’ s electoral mandate behind him in an attempt to get a start date for talks on turkish membership . european leaders do n't rule out eu membership schröder has said germany wants to keep the door open for turkey to join the eu , although he is unwilling to commit himself to any timetable .
" europe has a fundamental interest in stopping such an important country as turkey from sliding into islamic fundamentalism , ” he told reporters last week , although he stressed that the final outcome would largely depend on the progress of human rights reforms in the country . other leaders are less cautious : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said after meeting erdogan last week the eu should not delay accession talks beyond 2003 . us tries to drum up support for important ally u.s. president george w. bush , with an eye firmly on ankara ’ s role in regional stability and as an ally in washington ’ s war against terror -lrb- and , potentially , iraq -rrb- , has also signalled american support for turkey ’ s candidature . on monday , bush called danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen ´ , currently the eu 's rotating president , to press his case . afterwards , the white house announced the two men “ agreed on the historic and strategic importance of advancing turkey ’ s evolution toward the european union and the importance of the copenhagen summit in that regard . ” the case against turkey in europe many europeans are still not convinced turkey belongs in the eu at all .
most of the leaders of germany ’ s conservative opposition share the opinion of the former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .
the five other stadiums will all require partial reconstruction totaling 568.2 million euro -lrb- $ 575.2m -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup , www-links fifaworldcup.com fifa , the world 's soccer authority , presents world cup news from the past , present and future .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.11.2002 eu launches deficit procedure against germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel , left , is facing a massive budget shortfall the european union is taking formal action against one of the chief architects of the pact regulating stability of the euro .
it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .
but both eichel and his french counterpart , francis mer , agreed last month that the credibility of the euro would be weakened if its two largest economies were seen to flout the deficit rule . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de black week for german chancellor the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .

it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .

you 're on the world cup logo germany unveiled its world cup 2006 logo on tuesday under a financial cloud .
estimated costs for the soccer extravaganza have been exposed as being optimistically low . for germany , a country which holds the winning of the soccer world cup as its sacred right , staging the 2006 finals is almost as good as lifting the golden trophy itself .
on tuesday , one day prior to the friendly match between germany and the netherlands , the german 2006 fifa world cup organizing committee unveiled the emblem for the championships in four years time to a selected crowd of 500 guests at the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kaiser : " lend us an euro " committee chief franz beckenbauer proudly showed off the 2006 artwork which will adorn not only the venues and team shirts but also the vast array of merchandising that organiziers hope will bring in millions of euros to the coffers of the german organizers and world soccer authority , fifa .
" the presentation of the official tournament emblem will kick off all of our national and international public relations efforts " , said beckenbauer .
tournament costs are higher than first thought however , at the moment , money is a sore point with the germans .
the estimated cost of running the tournament was originally quoted as being around 250 million euro -lrb- $ 252.9m -rrb- .
the more likely figure shows that the original number was optimistically low - the german committee is likely to face a bill closer to 400 million euro -lrb- $ 404.7m -rrb- .
now more than ever , it seems the committee needs the money from those whose pledges helped germany succeed in the selection process .
beckenbauer , one of the lucky germans to have held the golden trophy aloft in victory , told a press conference last week that 12 out of the 15 corporate sponsors expected to sign on for world cup 2006 had put pen to paper .
he added that " sponsors number 14 and 15 are in preparation .
the latest time for the packet to be complete will be the new year 2003 . "
the committee also announced a newly forged partnership with the insurance company hamburg-mannheimer inc. as one of the official suppliers .
six supplies are planned ; at the moment there are only two , the other being german retailing giant karstadtquelle .
vice president of the committee , wolfgang niersbach has said that before christmas 2002 , there will be two more with the final pair expected to be secured by the middle of 2003 .
sponsorship deals expected to boost coffers each official supplier should contribute between 10 and 15 million euro -lrb- $ 10.1-15.1m -rrb- to the german sponsorship package with fifa adding a proportion of its own .
the world football authority has deals that bring in 26 million euro -lrb- $ 26.3m -rrb- from its international sponsors .
with 12 german stadiums being used throughout the tournament , attempts to get all of them up to fifa standard before the summer of 2006 are also driving costs up .
seven of the cities selected to host to games will need to either perform extensive renovations on their stadiums or build new ones .
cost of stadium reconstruction spiralling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's biggest money box : the allianz arena the combined cost of construction for the seven cities , including brand new stadiums in berlin and the bavarian capital munich , will be in the region of 852.8 million euro -lrb- $ 863.5m -rrb- .
in most cases , a percentage or , as in the case of the new allianz arena in munich , the whole cost will be met by the clubs themselves .
sponsorship deals with companies willing to put their names to the stadiums are also helping cover the mammoth fees .
as well as insurers allianz , internet company aol has paid 14.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- for the honor of renaming hamburg 's volkspark the aol arena .
the five other stadiums will all require partial reconstruction totaling 568.2 million euro -lrb- $ 575.2m -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup , www-links fifaworldcup.com fifa , the world 's soccer authority , presents world cup news from the past , present and future . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.11.2002 eu launches deficit procedure against germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel , left , is facing a massive budget shortfall the european union is taking formal action against one of the chief architects of the pact regulating stability of the euro .
it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .
but both eichel and his french counterpart , francis mer , agreed last month that the credibility of the euro would be weakened if its two largest economies were seen to flout the deficit rule . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de black week for german chancellor the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .

launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .
but both eichel and his french counterpart , francis mer , agreed last month that the credibility of the euro would be weakened if its two largest economies were seen to flout the deficit rule . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de black week for german chancellor the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .

recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .

instead , the slot of prime minister has been filled by abdullah gul , who is considered a moderate in the party , which has links to political islam . but behind the scenes and abroad , erdogan appears to be calling the shots . with a decisive summit on eu expansion due to take place in copenhagen in less than four weeks , he is throwing the whole weight of his party ’ s electoral mandate behind him in an attempt to get a start date for talks on turkish membership . european leaders do n't rule out eu membership schröder has said germany wants to keep the door open for turkey to join the eu , although he is unwilling to commit himself to any timetable .
" europe has a fundamental interest in stopping such an important country as turkey from sliding into islamic fundamentalism , ” he told reporters last week , although he stressed that the final outcome would largely depend on the progress of human rights reforms in the country . other leaders are less cautious : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said after meeting erdogan last week the eu should not delay accession talks beyond 2003 . us tries to drum up support for important ally u.s. president george w. bush , with an eye firmly on ankara ’ s role in regional stability and as an ally in washington ’ s war against terror -lrb- and , potentially , iraq -rrb- , has also signalled american support for turkey ’ s candidature . on monday , bush called danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen ´ , currently the eu 's rotating president , to press his case . afterwards , the white house announced the two men “ agreed on the historic and strategic importance of advancing turkey ’ s evolution toward the european union and the importance of the copenhagen summit in that regard . ” the case against turkey in europe many europeans are still not convinced turkey belongs in the eu at all .
most of the leaders of germany ’ s conservative opposition share the opinion of the former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the head of the working group drafting an eu constitution , d 'estaing recently sparked off a major international row after asserting that turkey is not geographically or culturally european and that its accession would signify " the end of the european union . " roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , agrees . " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that 's a european tradition , ” he told deutsche welle last week .
“ of course , we ca n't blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we must n't ignore that fact , " he said . even if he does manage to extract enough commitments to support turkey ’ s candidacy , erdogan still could find it is not enough to tip the balance .
the akp ’ s roots in two outlawed islamist parties and his own conviction for alleged sedition means the new government - turkey ’ s first single-party government in 15 years - will be viewed with suspicion in many quarters . a sticking point the other issue is cyprus .
u.n. efforts to reunite the island are in danger of stalling because , so far at least , only the greek cypriot side has declared its willingness to negotiate .
erdogan recognizes that turkey ’ s case with the eu would be greatly strengthened if he could bring the turkish cypriots to the negotiating table and withdraw the 30,000 troops ankara has kept on the island since the 1974 invasion .
but he admits that might not happen in time for the copenhagen summit , which begins dec .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .
but when it comes to the so-called " cheap " flag countries - where ship registration is subjected to fewer fees and regulations - such measures are not a matter of course .
and in the case of prestige , a greek shipping company was sailing under the flag of the bahamas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ecological disaster imminent as tanker sinks around 77,000 tons of oil could escaped from the stricken vessel " prestige " after it sank off the northwestern spanish coast .
the ensuing disaster could be even worse than the 1989 exxon valdez catastrophe off alaska .
-lrb- nov .
19 , 2002 -rrb- oil continues to spill as blame is passed the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame .

recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels . turkey 's unofficial new leader , recep tayyip erdogan , meets german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday night as part of a major diplomatic offensive to promote his country 's accession to the european union . erdogan ’ s justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which scored a landslide victory two weeks ago , took office on monday . erdogan himself is banned from holding a formal post in the government because of a conviction for islamist sedition .
instead , the slot of prime minister has been filled by abdullah gul , who is considered a moderate in the party , which has links to political islam . but behind the scenes and abroad , erdogan appears to be calling the shots . with a decisive summit on eu expansion due to take place in copenhagen in less than four weeks , he is throwing the whole weight of his party ’ s electoral mandate behind him in an attempt to get a start date for talks on turkish membership . european leaders do n't rule out eu membership schröder has said germany wants to keep the door open for turkey to join the eu , although he is unwilling to commit himself to any timetable .
" europe has a fundamental interest in stopping such an important country as turkey from sliding into islamic fundamentalism , ” he told reporters last week , although he stressed that the final outcome would largely depend on the progress of human rights reforms in the country . other leaders are less cautious : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said after meeting erdogan last week the eu should not delay accession talks beyond 2003 . us tries to drum up support for important ally u.s. president george w. bush , with an eye firmly on ankara ’ s role in regional stability and as an ally in washington ’ s war against terror -lrb- and , potentially , iraq -rrb- , has also signalled american support for turkey ’ s candidature . on monday , bush called danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen ´ , currently the eu 's rotating president , to press his case . afterwards , the white house announced the two men “ agreed on the historic and strategic importance of advancing turkey ’ s evolution toward the european union and the importance of the copenhagen summit in that regard . ” the case against turkey in europe many europeans are still not convinced turkey belongs in the eu at all .
most of the leaders of germany ’ s conservative opposition share the opinion of the former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .
but when it comes to the so-called " cheap " flag countries - where ship registration is subjected to fewer fees and regulations - such measures are not a matter of course .
and in the case of prestige , a greek shipping company was sailing under the flag of the bahamas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ecological disaster imminent as tanker sinks around 77,000 tons of oil could escaped from the stricken vessel " prestige " after it sank off the northwestern spanish coast .
the ensuing disaster could be even worse than the 1989 exxon valdez catastrophe off alaska .
-lrb- nov .
19 , 2002 -rrb- oil continues to spill as blame is passed the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame .

the company allegedly involved dentists in a scam where they fitted patients with cheap false teeth , bridges and crowns from south-east asia but charged them - and thereby usually also the health insurers - for much more expensive ones purported to have been made in germany .
the main state health insurer , aok , estimates the damage of the fraud at 50 million euros -lrb- $ 50.1 million -rrb- .

recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels . turkey 's unofficial new leader , recep tayyip erdogan , meets german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday night as part of a major diplomatic offensive to promote his country 's accession to the european union . erdogan ’ s justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which scored a landslide victory two weeks ago , took office on monday . erdogan himself is banned from holding a formal post in the government because of a conviction for islamist sedition .
instead , the slot of prime minister has been filled by abdullah gul , who is considered a moderate in the party , which has links to political islam . but behind the scenes and abroad , erdogan appears to be calling the shots . with a decisive summit on eu expansion due to take place in copenhagen in less than four weeks , he is throwing the whole weight of his party ’ s electoral mandate behind him in an attempt to get a start date for talks on turkish membership . european leaders do n't rule out eu membership schröder has said germany wants to keep the door open for turkey to join the eu , although he is unwilling to commit himself to any timetable .
" europe has a fundamental interest in stopping such an important country as turkey from sliding into islamic fundamentalism , ” he told reporters last week , although he stressed that the final outcome would largely depend on the progress of human rights reforms in the country . other leaders are less cautious : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said after meeting erdogan last week the eu should not delay accession talks beyond 2003 . us tries to drum up support for important ally u.s. president george w. bush , with an eye firmly on ankara ’ s role in regional stability and as an ally in washington ’ s war against terror -lrb- and , potentially , iraq -rrb- , has also signalled american support for turkey ’ s candidature . on monday , bush called danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen ´ , currently the eu 's rotating president , to press his case . afterwards , the white house announced the two men “ agreed on the historic and strategic importance of advancing turkey ’ s evolution toward the european union and the importance of the copenhagen summit in that regard . ” the case against turkey in europe many europeans are still not convinced turkey belongs in the eu at all .
most of the leaders of germany ’ s conservative opposition share the opinion of the former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the head of the working group drafting an eu constitution , d 'estaing recently sparked off a major international row after asserting that turkey is not geographically or culturally european and that its accession would signify " the end of the european union . " roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , agrees . " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that 's a european tradition , ” he told deutsche welle last week .
“ of course , we ca n't blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we must n't ignore that fact , " he said . even if he does manage to extract enough commitments to support turkey ’ s candidacy , erdogan still could find it is not enough to tip the balance .
the akp ’ s roots in two outlawed islamist parties and his own conviction for alleged sedition means the new government - turkey ’ s first single-party government in 15 years - will be viewed with suspicion in many quarters . a sticking point the other issue is cyprus .
u.n. efforts to reunite the island are in danger of stalling because , so far at least , only the greek cypriot side has declared its willingness to negotiate .
erdogan recognizes that turkey ’ s case with the eu would be greatly strengthened if he could bring the turkish cypriots to the negotiating table and withdraw the 30,000 troops ankara has kept on the island since the 1974 invasion .
but he admits that might not happen in time for the copenhagen summit , which begins dec .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .
but when it comes to the so-called " cheap " flag countries - where ship registration is subjected to fewer fees and regulations - such measures are not a matter of course .
and in the case of prestige , a greek shipping company was sailing under the flag of the bahamas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ecological disaster imminent as tanker sinks around 77,000 tons of oil could escaped from the stricken vessel " prestige " after it sank off the northwestern spanish coast .

the prestige sinks into the atlantic ocean off spain 's galician coast .
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them . after breaking in half , the oil tanker prestige finally went down 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the northwestern spanish coast on tuesday .
the tanker , whose hull had cracked in a storm on nov .
13 , was carrying some 70,000 tons -lrb- 18.5 million gallons -rrb- of oil , which now threatens birds , fish , marine mammals and plants along the galician coast . so far , 7,000 to 8,000 tons of oil have leaked into the ocean , according to spanish officials .
experts hope that the cold sea temperatures and the high pressure will harden the oil , preventing it from spreading from the tanker . but this is n't the first oil spill in the waters off galicia .
in december 1992 , the greek tanker aegean sea exploded in the bay of coruña , releasing 100,000 tons of crude oil and polluting 200 kilometers of the coast . environmentalists have been lobbying for tougher rules for international shipping for years , but policy-makers have been slow to respond .
under regulations previously approved by the european union , the united states and the international maritime organization , only double-hulled tankers will be allowed to sail into ports from 2015 .
but critics say that must happen sooner . " the 2015 deadline is much too long , " says hans-ulrich rösner , a spokesman for the conservation organization wwf .
greenpeace , meanwhile , estimates that more than 3,600 oil freighters are playing the seas that do n't meet safety requirements . poor coordination a further problem is that prevention usually does n't begin until an accident has already happened .
" that 's what the ' pallas ' oil disaster in the northern german mud flats in late 1998 showed , " the wwf expert points out . valuable time was lost in that accident because the various authorities failed to cooperate quickly .
the german states are now setting up a shared headquarters to handle accidents effectively .
" but we 're afraid that it will be far from ready to significantly improve the situation for the next accident at sea , " rösner criticizes . since 1991 , the helsinki commission -lrb- helcom -rrb- , focused on protecting the baltic sea , has coordinated containment efforts for oil spills .
each year an accident is simulated , most recently off the coast of latvia .
instead of oil , helcom uses popcorn , which behaves similarly , for the tests .
the simulation was a success this past august : within six hours the spill was under control thanks to latvia 's cooperation with its neighbors . helcom simulations , however , are limited to the baltic sea .
in the nearby north sea , oil was still being pumped out of the wreckage of the pallas tanker months after it broke apart off denmark 's west coast . rusting fleets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige gradually clients , and not just shipping companies , are starting to be held responsible for transporting dangerous cargo .
the tanker erika sank off the coast of brittany in 1999 , spilling 13,000 tons of oil and turning the french public against totalfina , the french oil company that had hired the vessel . the erika was 24 years old when it sank ; aegean sea was 19 .
and prestige , the sunken tanker off the spanish coast was 26 .
the ships ' old age is no coincidence : it is still cheaper to insure an old ship than to buy a new one . ministers in numerous countries bordering the baltic sea recently reached an agreement that crews should be required to receive training in environmental protection methods .
but when it comes to the so-called " cheap " flag countries - where ship registration is subjected to fewer fees and regulations - such measures are not a matter of course .
and in the case of prestige , a greek shipping company was sailing under the flag of the bahamas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ecological disaster imminent as tanker sinks around 77,000 tons of oil could escaped from the stricken vessel " prestige " after it sank off the northwestern spanish coast .

it says germany is itself responsible for snowballing deficit spending . the european commission has formally initiated disciplinary action against germany for exceeding the deficit ceiling laid down in the european union ’ s growth and stability pact .
launching the “ excessive deficit procedure ” in strasbourg on tuesday , monetary and economic affairs commissioner pedro solbes blamed germany 's government for the breach , and said the downturn in the global economy and the recent floods were not the deficit 's chief causes . the stability pact limits the fiscal deficit of countries belonging to the european monetary union to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in any one year .
article 104 of eu charter lays down the procedure the commission has to follow , culminating in a demand for a deposit of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of gdp to be lodged with brussels . the worst thing is probably the embarrassment in theory , this deposit could be converted into a fine if the country in question persistently ignores instructions from the commission and fails to balance its budget .
but , even then , such a move would require a two-thirds majority in a vote in the eu ’ s council of ministers . in fact , the main consequence of a violating the stability pact seems to be a huge loss of face .
in germany ’ s case , this is particularly extreme because the three-percent rule was adopted in 1997 at berlin ’ s behest .
chancellor helmut kohl and his finance minister , theo waigel , saw it as the best means to promote fiscal responsibility across the eurozone . adding to germany 's embarrassment , the commission has also expressed doubt that finance minister hans eichel will manage to get his budget back on track next year .
eichel will have to tackle the opposition to his austerity plans - even within his own party - if he is to succeed . due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the german government is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion . the deficit could be contageous germany is not the only country which has been having trouble with the deficit cap .
disciplinary measures have already been taken against portugal , and solbes has said the french government will be given an early warning because it also could go through the ceiling in 2003 .
the italian economy is also a cause for concern in brussels . this has led to calls for the pact to be scrapped , or at least relaxed .
but both eichel and his french counterpart , francis mer , agreed last month that the credibility of the euro would be weakened if its two largest economies were seen to flout the deficit rule . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de black week for german chancellor the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .

his tough stance on security issues was similar to mr sharon 's .
his decision to leave the government over the issue of funding for jewish settlements has more to do with internal labour party politics than with political or ideological differences with mr sharon .
ahead of elections for the labour leadership , mr ben-eliezer made a pitch for the support of the left of the party , but was beaten resoundingly by challenger amram mitzna . "
i am fouad , who immigrated by myself at age 13 on foot to the land of israel " binyamin ben-eliezer mr ben-eliezer follows the mould of many of the country 's other political leaders , with a long and highly decorated background in the state 's revered military .
born in iraq in 1936 , the former army general was the first israeli of middle eastern descent to lead the centre-left party .
his appointment was all the more surprising given that most sephardi jews in israel - those of eastern origin - have traditionally supported the rival right-wing likud party led by mr sharon .
mr ben-eliezer emigrated to the nascent state of israel a year after its formation , and although he changed his iraqi name fouad to the hebrew binyamin , he has stayed loyal to his roots .
military careerist a gruff , straight talking pragmatist with little charisma , mr ben-eliezer entered the army in 1954 and rose through its ranks to become military governor of the west bank .
in 1976 , mr ben-eliezer was responsible for setting up links between israel and its christian militia allies in south lebanon and , along with then-defence minister sharon , mr ben-eliezer helped plan israel 's invasion of its northern neighbour to repel palestinian guerrillas .
mr ben-eliezer is one of the most hawkish members of the labour party , which negotiated the oslo peace accords with the palestine liberation organisation -lrb- plo -rrb- in 1993 .
he favours a tough approach towards dealing with the palestinian uprising , while supporting a " compromise " in final status talks with the palestinian authority .
as communications minister in ehud barak 's government , mr ben-eliezer went against the then-prime minister in calling for a halt to peace talks until the violence ended .
hardline appointed israel 's defence minister by mr sharon in march , 2002 , mr ben-eliezer has backed controversial measures against the palestinians , including the targeted killing of palestinian militants .
mr ben-eliezer has said he would not compromise on the status of jerusalem as israel 's declared capital and supports the continuation of jewish settlements on the west bank and in the gaza strip .
he has , however , said he would be ready to make concessions when the time was right .
" for us and the palestinians , it is clear that the day is not far off when we will return to the negotiating table , " he told party leaders .

the former mayor of haifa was the choice of the peace movement and those on the left of the party seeking to distance themselves from politicians who served with the right-wing likud party in the coalition government .
the former general says he will negotiate with yasser arafat he has come out firmly against joining a unity government with ariel sharon 's likud party after the elections .
mr mitzna combines his experience as an army general with his dovish views , saying that his military experience taught him that military force alone can not solve israel 's problems .
he recently spoke out against the current curfews and conditions imposed on the palestinians by israel .
the labour leader has also tried to create a link between mr sharon 's hard-line security policy and the country 's economic plight .
the labour party has been in the depths of despair and the appearance of mitzna from relative obscurity has revitalised it uri avneri , veteran peace activist mr mitzna proposes an immediate renewal of peace talks - even if it means sitting down with the palestinian leader yasser arafat .
referring to mr sharon 's us-backed drive to force a change in the palestinian leadership , mr mitzna says it is not up to israel to choose its negotiating partner .
uri avneri , a former member of the knesset and a veteran peace activist , told bbc news online that mr mitzna " has a hell of a lot of political courage to even dare to mention yasser arafat 's name . "
" the labour party has been in the depths of despair and the appearance of mitzna from relative obscurity has revitalised it , morale is coming back .
he is the only hope of effecting any political change , " mr avneri added .
decorated veteran mr mitzna was born in 1945 on a kibbutz .
his parents were refugees from hitler 's germany .
after a stint at harvard university in the us , he returned home and joined the israeli defence force -lrb- idf -rrb- in 1963 .
he is one of the country 's most decorated veterans , after serving in the six-day war in 1967 , in the yom kippur war in 1973 and in lebanon .
he earned the reputation of " dovish general " after making a stand against ariel sharon over his involvement in the palestinian massacres at sabra and shatila refugee camps in lebanon in 1982 .
he is one of two generals to have resigned over israel 's long involvement in lebanon , but was brought back to high command by menahem begin .
mr mitzna opposed mr sharon over his role in lebanon in the 1980s mr mitzna served as idf commander in the west bank during the first palestinian uprising , where he was said to be as tough as any other general in dealings with the palestinians .
at the time , he angered the left , which accused him of bending over backwards to appease jewish settlers .
latterly , mr mitzna said most of the settlements must go .
six months after taking over the party - and three months after general elections in which labour suffered a major defeat - mr mitzna resigned as labour leader .
he said constant backstabbing by labour rivals was the reason for his decision .

mr mitzna combines his experience as an army general with his dovish views , saying that his military experience taught him that military force alone can not solve israel 's problems .
he recently spoke out against the current curfews and conditions imposed on the palestinians by israel .
the labour leader has also tried to create a link between mr sharon 's hard-line security policy and the country 's economic plight . "
the labour party has been in the depths of despair and the appearance of mitzna from relative obscurity has revitalised it " uri avneri , veteran peace activist mr mitzna proposes an immediate renewal of peace talks - even if it means sitting down with the palestinian leader yasser arafat .
referring to mr sharon 's us-backed drive to force a change in the palestinian leadership , mr mitzna says it is not up to israel to choose its negotiating partner .
uri avneri , a former member of the knesset and a veteran peace activist , told bbc news online that mr mitzna " has a hell of a lot of political courage to even dare to mention yasser arafat 's name . "
" the labour party has been in the depths of despair and the appearance of mitzna from relative obscurity has revitalised it , morale is coming back .
he is the only hope of effecting any political change , " mr avneri added .
decorated veteran mr mitzna was born in 1945 on a kibbutz .
his parents were refugees from hitler 's germany .
after a stint at harvard university in the us , he returned home and joined the israeli defence force -lrb- idf -rrb- in 1963 .
he is one of the country 's most decorated veterans , after serving in the six-day war in 1967 , in the yom kippur war in 1973 and in lebanon .
he earned the reputation of " dovish general " after making a stand against ariel sharon over his involvement in the palestinian massacres at sabra and shatila refugee camps in lebanon in 1982 .
he is one of two generals to have resigned over israel 's long involvement in lebanon , but was brought back to high command by menahem begin .
mr mitzna served as idf commander in the west bank during the first palestinian uprising , where he was said to be as tough as any other general in dealings with the palestinians .
at the time , he angered the left , which accused him of bending over backwards to appease jewish settlers .
latterly , mr mitzna said most of the settlements must go .
six months after taking over the party - and three months after general elections in which labour suffered a major defeat - mr mitzna resigned as labour leader .
he said constant backstabbing by labour rivals was the reason for his decision .

speaking on his arrival in prague for a nato summit , president bush urged members of the alliance to unite against iraq should the need arise . "
i hope our nato friends come with us " president bush mr bush is to hold a series of meetings with nato allies on wednesday to try to gain wider backing for possible military action against baghdad .
while iraq is not officially on the conference agenda , the topic is likely to overshadow discussions on expanding the western alliance to include seven new members .
members are also expected to endorse the creation of a new rapid reaction nato force to deal with the growing threat of international terrorism .
support sought while iraq does not concern nato directly , the us will be counting on the support of the individual members of the alliance , both political and practical , in the event of any conflict .
the bbc 's defence correspondent jonathan marcus , who is in prague , says it is this which gives added importance to president bush 's meetings with his french and turkish counterparts - two countries who , because of their diplomatic weight or strategic importance , will be crucial actors in the unfolding drama .
france , a permanent member of the united nations security council , has openly opposed us threats of force against iraq , while the continuing use of turkey 's incirlik airbase is vital to any us air strikes .
our correspondent says that as far as nato is concerned , president bush has to demonstrate that his administration regards the alliance as a valuable asset in its own terms and not just as a potential toolbox of military assets on which the pentagon can draw .
if the un inspection process in iraq fails , mr bush has to carry his major allies with him .
rapid response the two-day summit will mainly focus on plans to expand and transform the organisation .
prospective new members bulgaria estonia latvia lithuania romania slovakia slovenia members will invite seven ex-communist states to join the alliance in 2004 , in the single largest inclusion of new countries within nato since it was established in 1949 .
nato officials have described the event as the transformation summit , which will also see plans to reshape the alliance to meet new security threats .
this includes the creation of a rapid response force , comprising 21,000 combat-ready troops , ready to deploy quickly to trouble spots around the world and play a key role in the us-led war on international terrorism .
president bush has indicated he will not ask nato for military help against iraq , but white house aides said they were working to get the alliance to issue a statement supporting the goal of disarming iraq .
speaking on czech television on tuesday , president bush said that if necessary america would " lead a coalition of the willing " to rid iraq of banned weapons , adding : " i hope our nato friends come with us . "
security concerns a huge security operation is under way in the czech capital , prague , as 40 heads of state arrive for the landmark summit .
nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and special forces are on the alert for threats ranging from terrorist attacks to anarchist demonstrations , and us fighters are providing security in the air .
to protect delegates at the summit - nato 's first behind the former iron curtain - a no-go area for ordinary people is being set up around the summit venue , and streets are to be sealed off for official convoys .

the report said the current approach used to deal with the flooding problem was backward and irresponsible .
it predicted future climate change and more building on flood plains would see the risk continue to rise .
the report , turning the tide on flooding , has called for a national flood strategy to create effective flood protection and avoid " piecemeal " responses .
using the river clyde as a case study , wwf said it found that three recent floods had cost the insurance industry £ 170m .
it said glasgow was the fourth most " at risk " city in the uk for flooding .
it also said 14 different organisations , excluding the emergency services , had some responsibility for flooding .
a wwf spokeswoman claimed the scottish executive had failed to provide a cohesive approach to deal with the problem .
she called for someone to be given overall charge of a national strategy to manage scotland 's waters .
the wwf has called for : a national floods strategy for scotland ; an overhaul of flood legislation , defence funding and responsibilities ; a national river basin advisory group ; and support and commitment to a role for flood appraisal groups .
the report said : " with no national overview in scotland , flood management is reduced to over-reliance on concrete defences and flood warnings . "
flooding brought misery to the moray area of northern scotland last weekend for the third time in five years .
first minister jack mcconnell has registered his concerns over the " regular series " of floods across scotland .
national strategy he pledged to establish a special cabinet sub-committee chaired by the deputy first minister to look at the speed with which improvements could be made to flood defences .
but an executive spokesman said ministers did not feel a national strategy was the best way of guarding against future flooding .
in july a uk government advisor on flood defences said people living in scotland should brace themselves for more frequent floods .
george fleming said the one-in-five-year flood was becoming an annual event .
he said road maintenance for flood risk management was at an all-time low and required an overhaul to cope with the extreme conditions .
