they feel the police and the national guard will not be able to protect them in time local resident jose " people right now in caracas are in terror i would say .
i would use that word , " says one neighbour jose .
" they are preparing themselves because they feel the police and the national guard will not be able to protect them in time so they have to protect themselves .
" we feel that in this new case they will come with more power to do harm to the people . "
chavez blames the opposition for stoking coup fears neighbourhoods in many parts of caracas have started to form self-defence groups following the failed coup against mr chavez in april during which more than 60 people were killed and hundreds of shops and businesses looted .
the looting mainly took place in poorer areas of the city , which make up the core of the support for mr chavez .
the neighbourhood groups fear that if another attempt is made to remove mr chavez , the violence will be even worse .
opposition leaders have lodged legal proceedings against him and caracas is awash with rumours that disgruntled military officers are preparing another coup .
they fear that waves of mr chavez ' supporters will descend from the city 's hillside slums not only to loot , but to target their homes .
they say the government is deliberately arming the bolivarian circles , neighbourhood groups created by mr chavez to perform social work in poorer areas .
the government denies it has done so and says it will prosecute anyone who owns a gun illegally .
emergency plan arnoldo , another member of the self-defence group , told me neighbours had begun stocking up on food and water , medical supplies and assigning roles in the event that " suspicious " people are seen in the neighbourhood .
it was an unarmed society .
we 've been pushed into taking some precautions local resident arnoldo after an aerosol alarm is sounded , a line of cars will block access to the area and oil spread on the road to deter any motorised supporters of mr chavez .
those neighbours with guns have also been given roles .
" it was an unarmed society .
we 've been pushed into taking some precautions , " arnoldo says .
" yes , we have identified some people and we 've given them responsibilities for a fatal scenario .
we have to , " he said .
" we are talking about protection , protecting our families , our values .
we wo n't let them take away the things that have taken us so long to get . "
hysteria to many venezuelans , this may seem like collective hysteria in response to an opposition and media who have whipped up fears that the bolivarian circles are armed .
we hope there will be an institutional solution to the crisis .
we say no to violence local resident arnoldo although some circles may be armed , there is precious little evidence to suggest that most do anything other than useful community work .
arnoldo says he hopes rumours of a coup and violence have been exaggerated .
" we hope there will be an institutional solution to the crisis .
we say no to violence , " he says .
" there are violent people in the bolivarian circles , but this is a very small proportion of our society .
" venezuela is much more than what we are going through now .
we are talking to our children about what a nice country we will have , not this war that we 're having . "

a crowd of 150 attacked the police with blast bombs , petrol bombs , stones and bricks when they were called to the short strand area at about 0300 bst on saturday morning .
two houses in the loyalist cluan place were damaged by fire , one severely , after they were hit by petrol bombs .
the progressive unionist party says the trouble was started by republicans intent on increasing tension in the area .
sinn fein says the violence was started by loyalists .
the violence follows a warning from the police service of northern ireland that the demands of dealing with street disturbances had resulted in an increase in ordinary crime .
that report , the first since the psni replaced the ruc last november , showed 17 people had died in the province as a result of continuing civil disorder during the year to the end of march .

according to the times , ministers have been swayed by two government reports on the outbreak , to be published next month .
these will urge them into scrapping the slaughter policy if the disease returns , with healthy animals being vaccinated instead to prevent the disease from spreading . "
i do n't doubt that vaccination will have a stronger role as part of a contingency plan " elliot morley , environment minister environment minister elliot morley said vaccinations were a viable " option " since the relaxation of world trade rules which prevented the export of meat and livestock for a year after a vaccine is used .
supporters of vaccination say it could prevent another outbreak , and that mass culling is simply needless .
but there are problems with it : it takes four days to work , and even then may not be completely effective .
vaccinated animals can still carry the virus and pass it on , without showing any symptoms .
' technical problems ' there would be a marked effect on uk exports - some could continue , but british meat would be barred from the us , and vaccinated british animals could not be exported there or to japan .
mr morley told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " there are some technical problems with vaccination and some problems in relation to the rules on application .
" i actually think these are problems that can be overcome and i do n't doubt that vaccination will have a stronger role as part of a contingency plan although it is probably likely to be used alongside the stamping-out policy .
" but i do n't doubt that it will have a greater use in the future , particularly as technology improves and also as we get some of the trade rules , which prevent the use of vaccination , changed . "
there are several strains of foot-and-mouth , and vaccines work against only one strain of the virus .
animals need booster shots every six months or so .
positive blood tests for another serious disease affecting pigs have been made at the essex abattoir where the foot-and-mouth outbreak was first discovered .
routine tests at cheale meats in brentwood revealed six suspected cases of aujeszky 's disease - an illness which can kill piglets , though it is not as contagious as foot-and-mouth .
further tests are being carried out at premises around england , which supplied the animals , including lancashire , cheshire , west and north yorkshire , west sussex and lincolnshire .
the state veterinary service will visit the six premises where the pigs either came from or had contact with .
the first british case of aujeszky 's disease - which is also known as pseudorabies - was in 1979 .
slaughtering affected animals had wiped out the disease within 10 years and the country was declared free of the disease in 1991 .

announcing the move , assistant secretary of defence for health affairs william winkenwerder also said the us was resuming mandatory anthrax vaccinations of military personnel in high-risk areas . "
anthrax is highly lethal and it 's easily stored ; we know that potential adversaries do possess it " william winkenwerder , assistant secretary of defence this marks a change of the previous policy of vaccinating all the members of the armed forces , which had been scaled back due to the shortage of supplies .
the vaccines will not be available for civilians to buy .
the deaths from anthrax of five americans , including postal and hospital workers , and the infection of 13 others late last year have fuelled demand for an effective vaccine .
investigators are yet to attribute responsibility for the anthrax attacks , in which letters laced with the bacteria were sent to dozens of american targets in the us and abroad .
shift mr winkenwerder said washington believed that the threat of an anthrax attack against us personnel remained real , but not all us troops would be inoculated .
he said the shots would be given to us military personnel , essential civilian defence officials or civilian contractors deployed for more than 15 days in high-threat areas and whose performance was essential to the mission .
previously , the vaccine had been reserved for troops on special missions and researchers alone .
" this is a shift from an earlier policy which was to vaccinate everyone - a total force vaccination policy , " mr winkenwerder said .
" anthrax is highly lethal and it 's easily stored ; we know that potential adversaries do possess it , " mr winkenwerder said .
he added that there was a domestic need for the vaccine to be set aside for civilians .
health department spokesman william raub said the doses reserved for civilians would only be used in the event of a domestic anthrax exposure , in combination with antibiotics .
mr winkenwerder did not reveal how many troops would receive the vaccine .
" we think it 's best to leave others guessing as to who and how many , " he said .
some us troops have refused to take the vaccine complaining of side effects , but mr winkenwerder said the jab was reliable and no deaths had resulted from the inoculations .

it will start treating its first nhs patients on tuesday .
the executive bought the hospital from the abu dhabi investment company for £ 37.5m in a deal signed on friday afternoon .
it will be used to cut waiting times , with patients from across scotland being sent there for heart operations , knee and hip replacements and plastic surgery .
the 540-bed private hospital had failed to make a profit since it opened in 1994 .
health minister malcolm chisholm described it as " a superb acquisition " and " a good deal for scotland " .
" we can now start to engage formally with the healthcare staff employed at the hospital and begin the transformation of the facility from private hospital to national waiting times centre , " he said .
he said work had already been carried out by the health service 's national waiting times unit to ensure that the hospital was put to effective use as soon as possible .
he said nhs patients would arrive for treatment from tuesday onwards .
the unit has arranged for patients from across scotland to be sent to the hospital for complex heart operations , major orthopaedic operations like knee replacements , plastic surgery and heart investigations like angiograms .
wealthy foreigners for the hospital , the change of ownership was the latest chapter in a history that has never been free from controversy .
originally envisaged by the conservative government as a major inward investment coup for scotland , it was built with foreign money and government funds .
it was intended to be a state-of-the-art hospital to be used by wealthy foreigners .

it will start treating its first nhs patients on tuesday .
the executive bought the hospital from the abu dhabi investment company for £ 37.5m in a deal signed on friday afternoon .
it will be used to cut waiting times , with patients from across scotland being sent there for heart operations , knee and hip replacements and plastic surgery .
the 540-bed private hospital had failed to make a profit since it opened in 1994 .
malcolm chisholm : " good deal " health minister malcolm chisholm described it as " a superb acquisition " and " a good deal for scotland " .
" we can now start to engage formally with the healthcare staff employed at the hospital and begin the transformation of the facility from private hospital to national waiting times centre , " he said .
he said work had already been carried out by the health service 's national waiting times unit to ensure that the hospital was put to effective use as soon as possible .
he said nhs patients would arrive for treatment from tuesday onwards .
the unit has arranged for patients from across scotland to be sent to the hospital for complex heart operations , major orthopaedic operations like knee replacements , plastic surgery and heart investigations like angiograms .
wealthy foreigners for the hospital , the change of ownership was the latest chapter in a history that has never been free from controversy .
originally envisaged by the conservative government as a major inward investment coup for scotland , it was built with foreign money and government funds .
it was intended to be a state-of-the-art hospital to be used by wealthy foreigners .
but after its opening in 1994 , the expected numbers of patients never materialised and the abu dhabi investment company acquired it from the previous owners .
it has a capacity for 540 beds but only about one tenth of that total are staffed .
