program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.10.2002 german ministry calls for end to airline subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air travel creates high costs for the environment the increased damage to the environment caused by frequent air travel needs to be reflected in higher prices for tickets and an elimination of subsidies for jet fuel , says the german environment ministry . a study published this week by the federal environment ministry in germany focuses attention on the " external costs " of frequent air travel .
according to research gathered by a team of scientists , air transport results in several negative side-effects such as increased levels of carbon dioxide emissions and noise pollution , all of which result in additional costs for communities located near airports .
but because these damages are not figured into the overall costs of a plane ticket , there is very little incentive for the aviation industry to reduce the impact it has on the environment .
up until now external costs such as those arising through health problems caused by air pollution and noise irritation or a decrease in property values have all had to be carried by the community , says andreas troge , president of the federal environment ministry -lrb- uba -rrb- .
the airlines themselves do little to contribute to lowering these costs , troge stated at a press conference prior to the release of the study .
on the contrary , the german aviation industry currently enjoys a special status within the transport sector , profiting from subsidies on jet fuel and tax abatements for profits made on international flights .
the total cost of the subsidies for the tax payer is around seven billion euro annually , troge says .
and no other sector has similar benefits – car drivers , for instance , are taxed heavily each time they go to fill up at the local gas station .
for this reason troge and his office are calling for an increase in ticket prices and an end to all aviation subsidies .
a cheap ticket is expensive for the environment although consumers may appreciate them , the advantages of cheap ticket prices offered by discount airlines such as ryanair and the upstart german wings are far outweighed by the damage done to the environment .
the " kölner stadt-anzeiger " newspaper in cologne , whose airport was recently expanded to make room for several discount carriers , points out that the " freedom over the clouds is not without its limits " and that the government needs to keep in mind not only " business regulations but also ecological requirements . "
according to the uba study , the external costs to the environment for a 500-kilometer flight -lrb- approximately the distance between munich and berlin -rrb- with a fully-booked 100-seat plane is about 10 euro per passenger .
for a long distance flight over 6,000 kilometers -lrb- frankfurt to chicago -rrb- , the environmental costs for a fully-booked 400-seat plane is 43 euro pro passenger .
the costs are based on the amount of fuel burned in flight , the length of the contrail the plane leaves and the amount of noise it creates during take off and landing .
in order to carry the cost of damage to the environment , airlines would need to increase their prices by about 20 percent , especially on the cheap long-distance flights , the study says .
this is not a popular option , as many airlines fear losing passengers at a time when the economy is drying up .
but troge ’ s office says doing so would force the public to be more conscious of the amount of environmental damage caused by air travel and encourage people to look for alternative means of transport wherever possible . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flying to a roman holiday for only € 29 for months , lufthansa has angrily watched as cheap carriers easy jet and ryanair wreak havoc on germany 's lucrative passenger market .

according to research gathered by a team of scientists , air transport results in several negative side-effects such as increased levels of carbon dioxide emissions and noise pollution , all of which result in additional costs for communities located near airports .
but because these damages are not figured into the overall costs of a plane ticket , there is very little incentive for the aviation industry to reduce the impact it has on the environment .
up until now external costs such as those arising through health problems caused by air pollution and noise irritation or a decrease in property values have all had to be carried by the community , says andreas troge , president of the federal environment ministry -lrb- uba -rrb- .
the airlines themselves do little to contribute to lowering these costs , troge stated at a press conference prior to the release of the study .
on the contrary , the german aviation industry currently enjoys a special status within the transport sector , profiting from subsidies on jet fuel and tax abatements for profits made on international flights .
the total cost of the subsidies for the tax payer is around seven billion euro annually , troge says .
and no other sector has similar benefits – car drivers , for instance , are taxed heavily each time they go to fill up at the local gas station .
for this reason troge and his office are calling for an increase in ticket prices and an end to all aviation subsidies .
a cheap ticket is expensive for the environment although consumers may appreciate them , the advantages of cheap ticket prices offered by discount airlines such as ryanair and the upstart german wings are far outweighed by the damage done to the environment .
the " kölner stadt-anzeiger " newspaper in cologne , whose airport was recently expanded to make room for several discount carriers , points out that the " freedom over the clouds is not without its limits " and that the government needs to keep in mind not only " business regulations but also ecological requirements . "
according to the uba study , the external costs to the environment for a 500-kilometer flight -lrb- approximately the distance between munich and berlin -rrb- with a fully-booked 100-seat plane is about 10 euro per passenger .
for a long distance flight over 6,000 kilometers -lrb- frankfurt to chicago -rrb- , the environmental costs for a fully-booked 400-seat plane is 43 euro pro passenger .
the costs are based on the amount of fuel burned in flight , the length of the contrail the plane leaves and the amount of noise it creates during take off and landing .
in order to carry the cost of damage to the environment , airlines would need to increase their prices by about 20 percent , especially on the cheap long-distance flights , the study says .
this is not a popular option , as many airlines fear losing passengers at a time when the economy is drying up .
but troge ’ s office says doing so would force the public to be more conscious of the amount of environmental damage caused by air travel and encourage people to look for alternative means of transport wherever possible . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flying to a roman holiday for only € 29 for months , lufthansa has angrily watched as cheap carriers easy jet and ryanair wreak havoc on germany 's lucrative passenger market .

in every israeli you find two parties .
if he ca n't find anyone to argue with , he 'll argue with himself communications minister reuben rivlin they know that israel is faced with daunting challenges , from the palestinian uprising , to economic recession , and the fall-out from a possible conflict in iraq .
but all thoughts are on the vote on the state budget and the likelihood that labor will either walk , or be thrown out of prime minister ariel sharon 's coalition government .
communications minister reuben rivlin is the chairman of the likud caucus in the knesset .
he says israel 's parliament merely reflects the inherently disputatious nature of its society : ben eliezer : rift with sharon not healed " in every israeli you find two parties .
if he ca n't find anyone to argue with , he 'll argue with himself ... everywhere , in the street , in restaurants , in schools even , every youngster knows politics and how it works .
" i really believe that -lsb- the defence minister and labor 's leader -rsb- binyamin ben-eliezer may eventually come round and see sense .

if reports from the labor camp are accurate , mr ben-eliezer and mr sharon have failed to patch their rift , and labor are set to leave the government .
the dispute over funding for the jewish settlements is not , according to most observers , the real coalition-breaker .
this is an ego war , to see who is the leader , who is calling the shots political commentator chaim shibi both leaders face challenges from within their own parties - former prime minister binyamin netanyahu is thought to be nurturing a challenge to mr sharon as likud leader , while mr ben-eliezer will face a primary contest for the labour leadership on 19 november .
chaim shibi , political commentator for the daily newspaper yedioth ahronoth , believes these internal pressures are forcing the two coalition partners to act tough to bolster their own supporters : " definitely the national interest calls for more stability at this time .

mathematics of survival prime minister ariel sharon strode into the knesset on the eve of the budget vote as bullish as ever .
surrounded by bodyguards and admiring supporters , he commanded the audience - a tourism promotion reception - with his considerable presence .
" i still hope to lead a government of national unity -lrb- including labor -rrb- but in any other coalition of the government i will continue to make every effort to bring security and step out on the path to peace , " he boomed .
high defence costs have made the budget necessary the mathematics of survival for mr sharon are complicated , but there are enough minor parties to replace the loss of labor .
that would mean a narrower , more right-wing coalition , and quite probably early elections .
ariel sharon took no questions but a hint of his mood might be gained from an israeli newspaper report on tuesday .
the reporter got through to mr sharon 's residence .
expecting to find the prime minister subdued or even racked by crisis , he asked him how he was feeling and what he was doing : " i 'm sitting on my chair in front of a basket full of fresh fruit and i 'm peeling an apple " , mr sharon replied nonchalantly .

the company dominates japan 's mobile phone market , and is a world leader in the roll-out of third-generation mobile phones .
but in recent weeks docomo had to write off $ 4.7bn of its investments in the united states , britain , the netherlands and other foreign markets hurt by the global economic slump .
and at home docomo has already spent some two trillion yen -lrb- $ 16.25bn -rrb- on third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phones , which allow users high-speed internet access and video-conferencing .
but the new service has yet to make a profit and the company is pondering the cost of allowing its users global roaming .
technical problems hit earnings being first with 3g has not given docomo a head start on earnings .
technical problems have kept user numbers well below expectations and docomo short of precious cash flow .

bbc news online looks at the changes .
what is the most important change ?
from january , mps will sit on tuesdays , wednesdays and thursdays from 1130 to 1900 gmt .
why is that important ?
it means an end to something that has been traditional at westminster for as long as anyone can remember - the idea of voting until well after midnight .
what are the other important changes ?
as a result of the new timetable , mps will hear important ministerial statements at lunchtime rather than in the afternoon .
prime minister 's question time will be at noon .
why is this important ?
these events will have a much higher profile and be much more widely reported on radio and television news bulletins .
but will it make a great deal of difference to mps daily lives ?
some mps say they will still have work to do after the parliamentary chamber shuts at 1900 .
what about the others ?
they say it will free up evenings to relax and spend time with their families .
what else do the modernisers say ?
working in the morning will be more effective because people can contribute more when they are less tired .
and ?
some hope it will create a more attractive culture at westminster .
but what is the downside ?
a lot of labour backbenchers and conservatives say that while a lot of the changes may seem like common sense , they will make it easier for governments with big majorities to ignore the commons .
who else has concerns ?
labour whips and spouses are particularly worried about what mps with lots of time on their hands in the evenings might find to occupy them in london .

under current rules , people who think they have been mis-sold an endowment mortgage have three years to seek compensation , after receiving the first re-projection letter .
the clock has already started ticking sheila mckechnie , consumers ' association the ca said a large number of homeowners will unwittingly face this deadline in early 2003 , and it claims the financial services authority has failed to publicise this .
the ca now wants the financial watchdog to extend the deadline by 12 months .
what went wrong ?
the ca claims that over 60 % of people with endowment mortgages were given bad advice and are therefore entitled to compensation .
the industry has been forced to send letters to warn millions of homeowners in recent years that , because of poor investment returns , their endowment policy will now not pay off their mortgage as originally projected .
but rules dictate that consumers must register a formal complaint to the financial ombudsman within three years of receiving the so-called " re-projection letter " , if they believe they were mis-sold their endowment .
the ca suggests that for a large number of homeowners , the first indication that their endowment would not pay off their mortgage came in 2000 .
even if an endowment is doing fine at the moment , it still does n't mean you were n't mis-sold consumers ' association this means they only have a few weeks left to register their complaint .
" the clock has already started ticking , " said sheila mckechnie , director of the consumers ' association .
" if you were are unsure about whether you were mis-sold an endowment , you must act now because this could be your last chance to complain . "
mis-sold ?
mis-selling could involve not being told about the risks involved or being assured that policies would " definitely " pay off mortgages .
according to current rules , consumers who believe they were mis-sold an endowment mortgage can complain to the financial ombudsman service if they do not receive a satisfactory response from their original adviser .
the deadline for submitting a complaint is within three years of becoming aware that there was a potential shortfall .
about 100,000 complaints have already been received since april 2000 .
extension but the ca is urging all endowment mortgage holders to consider the advice they were given .
" even if an endowment is doing fine at the moment , it still does n't mean you were n't mis-sold , " said a spokeswoman for the ca .
the consumer watchdog also wants the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- to grant homeowners extra time to make their complaint .
" the fsa must throw consumers a lifeline and agree to take action to change the rules to give consumers an extra year to make a complaint , " said the ca .
