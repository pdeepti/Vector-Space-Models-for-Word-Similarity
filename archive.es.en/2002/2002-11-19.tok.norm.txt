a bitter battle has broken out between the german government and opposition parties over allegations the ruling coalition deceived the electorate over the state of the economy before the september election . a mudslinging match has erupted between the german government coalition and the opposition over the latter 's calls for a parliamentary committee investigation into alleged election fraud .
the christian democratic union , its sister party the christian social union , and the business-friendly free democrats have accused the government of deliberately misleading voters before the september election on the state of the german economy .
merkel wants investigation cdu leader angela merkel said a parliamentary investigation was the only way of determining how much and when the social democratic-green coalition knew about the grim economic situation .
it was important , she said , to find out whether the government had " knowingly suppressed knowledge " on the state of the economy , thereby committing electoral fraud .
the cdu is up in arms over the tax revenue forecasts presented by finance minister hans eichel before the election .

a bitter battle has broken out between the german government and opposition parties over allegations the ruling coalition deceived the electorate over the state of the economy before the september election . a mudslinging match has erupted between the german government coalition and the opposition over the latter 's calls for a parliamentary committee investigation into alleged election fraud .
the christian democratic union , its sister party the christian social union , and the business-friendly free democrats have accused the government of deliberately misleading voters before the september election on the state of the german economy .
merkel wants investigation cdu leader angela merkel said a parliamentary investigation was the only way of determining how much and when the social democratic-green coalition knew about the grim economic situation .
it was important , she said , to find out whether the government had " knowingly suppressed knowledge " on the state of the economy , thereby committing electoral fraud .
the cdu is up in arms over the tax revenue forecasts presented by finance minister hans eichel before the election .

the contract could see the company provide 120 million condoms a year in the fight against aids . with an annual distribution volume output of 500-600 million condoms a year , the united nations is the world 's biggest customer of barrier method contraception .
to be one of the united nations ' preferred suppliers would guarantee a company an outlet for 120 million condoms a year .
that 's the current target for german manufacturer condomi .
the cologne-based contraceptive company sent data and evidence of its quality and production methods last november as part of the process that could end with the signing of a lucrative and high-profile contract with the league of nations organization .
the contract would provide condomi with a partner that would not only satisfy its socially aware philosophy but also give the company an outlet for its ever increasing volume .
condomi was selling over 250 million condoms worldwide at the start of this year with that figure increasing to 720 million by the end of 2002 .
operating in the world market , such numbers would prove problematic when dealing with branded businesses alone .
long selection process stretches back to nov .
2001 since last year , condomi has been providing the united nations with details of its production experience in an attempt to prove its claim that it is amongst the world 's best when it comes to condoms .
on dec .
11 , a team of technical advisors will arrive to check condomi 's claims .

a bitter battle has broken out between the german government and opposition parties over allegations the ruling coalition deceived the electorate over the state of the economy before the september election . a mudslinging match has erupted between the german government coalition and the opposition over the latter 's calls for a parliamentary committee investigation into alleged election fraud .
the christian democratic union , its sister party the christian social union , and the business-friendly free democrats have accused the government of deliberately misleading voters before the september election on the state of the german economy .
merkel wants investigation cdu leader angela merkel said a parliamentary investigation was the only way of determining how much and when the social democratic-green coalition knew about the grim economic situation .
it was important , she said , to find out whether the government had " knowingly suppressed knowledge " on the state of the economy , thereby committing electoral fraud .
the cdu is up in arms over the tax revenue forecasts presented by finance minister hans eichel before the election .
due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the cabinet is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion .
" irresponsible " claims the social democrats ' party manager , wilhelm schmidt , dismissed the charges and described the cdu 's attempts as " irresponsible . "
he said merkel 's claim that the government knowingly remained silent on the economy was not sustainable .
" the fact is that we did n't know about the massive revenue shortfalls until september , " he said .
he also accused the opposition of duplicity , saying that if " they were so well-informed before the election why did they make electoral promises to the tune of € 70 billion ? "
electoral maneuver the greens ' budgetary spokesman , oswald metzger , said the cdu maneuver was a case of blatant electioneering by hesse 's premier , roland koch .
that state goes to the polls in february .
metzger said the budgetary shortfall was known not only to the federal government but also to the states before the general election .
there was more criticism for chancellor gerhard schröder and his government on monday after the federal audit office revealed that the government had wasted € 2 billion in public funds .
the office said thoses expenditures could have been avoided through prudent financial management .
one example for the government 's extravagance , the office said , was the development of a rocket-firing system for the german army worth € 157 million .
over 25 years had passed between the decision to develop it and its operation ability .
now , though , the bundeswehr had decided to scrap the system because it was out of date , the office criticized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , short on cash ?
there will be less money pouring into germany ’ s state coffers from tax revenues this year - at least € 4.6 billion less .
the weak economy is to blame , says the government , and crosses its fingers for a recovery .
-lrb- may 14 , 2002 -rrb- germany on the brink of recession germany 's most important business climate index continued to fall last month .
and growth is now expected to be just 0.7 percent .
despite that , the finance minister rejects an economy-boosting programme .

a bitter battle has broken out between the german government and opposition parties over allegations the ruling coalition deceived the electorate over the state of the economy before the september election . a mudslinging match has erupted between the german government coalition and the opposition over the latter 's calls for a parliamentary committee investigation into alleged election fraud .
the christian democratic union , its sister party the christian social union , and the business-friendly free democrats have accused the government of deliberately misleading voters before the september election on the state of the german economy .
merkel wants investigation cdu leader angela merkel said a parliamentary investigation was the only way of determining how much and when the social democratic-green coalition knew about the grim economic situation .
it was important , she said , to find out whether the government had " knowingly suppressed knowledge " on the state of the economy , thereby committing electoral fraud .
the cdu is up in arms over the tax revenue forecasts presented by finance minister hans eichel before the election .
due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the cabinet is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion .
" irresponsible " claims the social democrats ' party manager , wilhelm schmidt , dismissed the charges and described the cdu 's attempts as " irresponsible . "
he said merkel 's claim that the government knowingly remained silent on the economy was not sustainable .
" the fact is that we did n't know about the massive revenue shortfalls until september , " he said .
he also accused the opposition of duplicity , saying that if " they were so well-informed before the election why did they make electoral promises to the tune of € 70 billion ? "
electoral maneuver the greens ' budgetary spokesman , oswald metzger , said the cdu maneuver was a case of blatant electioneering by hesse 's premier , roland koch .
that state goes to the polls in february .
metzger said the budgetary shortfall was known not only to the federal government but also to the states before the general election .
there was more criticism for chancellor gerhard schröder and his government on monday after the federal audit office revealed that the government had wasted € 2 billion in public funds .
the office said thoses expenditures could have been avoided through prudent financial management .
one example for the government 's extravagance , the office said , was the development of a rocket-firing system for the german army worth € 157 million .
over 25 years had passed between the decision to develop it and its operation ability .
now , though , the bundeswehr had decided to scrap the system because it was out of date , the office criticized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , short on cash ?
there will be less money pouring into germany ’ s state coffers from tax revenues this year - at least € 4.6 billion less .
the weak economy is to blame , says the government , and crosses its fingers for a recovery .

the contract could see the company provide 120 million condoms a year in the fight against aids . with an annual distribution volume output of 500-600 million condoms a year , the united nations is the world 's biggest customer of barrier method contraception .
to be one of the united nations ' preferred suppliers would guarantee a company an outlet for 120 million condoms a year .
that 's the current target for german manufacturer condomi .
the cologne-based contraceptive company sent data and evidence of its quality and production methods last november as part of the process that could end with the signing of a lucrative and high-profile contract with the league of nations organization .
the contract would provide condomi with a partner that would not only satisfy its socially aware philosophy but also give the company an outlet for its ever increasing volume .
condomi was selling over 250 million condoms worldwide at the start of this year with that figure increasing to 720 million by the end of 2002 .
operating in the world market , such numbers would prove problematic when dealing with branded businesses alone .
long selection process stretches back to nov .
2001 since last year , condomi has been providing the united nations with details of its production experience in an attempt to prove its claim that it is amongst the world 's best when it comes to condoms .
on dec .
11 , a team of technical advisors will arrive to check condomi 's claims .
led by the united nations head of procurement , anne fabiani , the team will visit condomi 's factory in krakow , poland , and erfurt in eastern germany to carry out tests to evaluate the data provided by the company over the past year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un are looking for the best in condoms .
once the documented evidence has been verified , the un team will analyze the results of the participating companies and then offer a contract to four or five , depending on the level and quality of production .
un contract would provide guaranteed business frank tillmanns , a spokesperson for condomi ag , told dw-world that the united nations contract would be a major coup for the company .
" working with the united nations would provide a guaranteed volume per year , " he said .
" in this business , there 's some risk dealing with tenders because sometimes you do n't get paid on time .
but the un are great payers , " he said . condomi could rely on a lot of business from the united nations if selected to be one of its preferred suppliers .
condoms will be distributed throughout the united nations project framework as well as projects organized by other institutions backed with un support .
condomi hopes to add to its un portfolio in aids fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contract could bring condomi 's product to the four corners of the world .
last year , condomi supplied the bonn-based voluntary organization , the united nations volunteers -lrb- unv -rrb- , with 100,000 condoms .
the volunteers distributed the condoms to projects concentrating on hiv and aids prevention in african countries .
since the founding of the company , condomi has been committed to aids prevention and the promotion of safe sex , working actively in projects all over the world as well as at home as a sponsor and partner of the government-funded organization german aids help -lrb- deutsche aids hilfe -rrb- .
the company is due to open its first factory in south africa at the end of next year .

a bitter battle has broken out between the german government and opposition parties over allegations the ruling coalition deceived the electorate over the state of the economy before the september election . a mudslinging match has erupted between the german government coalition and the opposition over the latter 's calls for a parliamentary committee investigation into alleged election fraud .
the christian democratic union , its sister party the christian social union , and the business-friendly free democrats have accused the government of deliberately misleading voters before the september election on the state of the german economy .
merkel wants investigation cdu leader angela merkel said a parliamentary investigation was the only way of determining how much and when the social democratic-green coalition knew about the grim economic situation .
it was important , she said , to find out whether the government had " knowingly suppressed knowledge " on the state of the economy , thereby committing electoral fraud .
the cdu is up in arms over the tax revenue forecasts presented by finance minister hans eichel before the election .
due to a massive tax revenue shortfall the cabinet is due to approve an emergency € 13.5 billion increase in net borrowing this year , bringing the total to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- .
next year 's budget has also been revised after the projected € 15.5 billion in borrowing was increased to € 18.9 billion .
" irresponsible " claims the social democrats ' party manager , wilhelm schmidt , dismissed the charges and described the cdu 's attempts as " irresponsible . "
he said merkel 's claim that the government knowingly remained silent on the economy was not sustainable .
" the fact is that we did n't know about the massive revenue shortfalls until september , " he said .
he also accused the opposition of duplicity , saying that if " they were so well-informed before the election why did they make electoral promises to the tune of € 70 billion ? "
electoral maneuver the greens ' budgetary spokesman , oswald metzger , said the cdu maneuver was a case of blatant electioneering by hesse 's premier , roland koch .
that state goes to the polls in february .
metzger said the budgetary shortfall was known not only to the federal government but also to the states before the general election .
there was more criticism for chancellor gerhard schröder and his government on monday after the federal audit office revealed that the government had wasted € 2 billion in public funds .
the office said thoses expenditures could have been avoided through prudent financial management .
one example for the government 's extravagance , the office said , was the development of a rocket-firing system for the german army worth € 157 million .
over 25 years had passed between the decision to develop it and its operation ability .
now , though , the bundeswehr had decided to scrap the system because it was out of date , the office criticized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , short on cash ?

forty people were on the bus and many of the survivors are said to be critically injured .
the attack took place in a village in warangal district , some 200 kilometres -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the state capital hyderabad .
a local police official , gautam swanga , blamed the blast on the maoist guerrillas of the naxalite people 's war group , which has been fighting a campaign in five southern states .
the press trust of india news agency said it appeared that the rebels detonated the device by remote control .
deputy swanga said that after the bus was destroyed , the attackers opened fire on the burning wreckage , apparently thinking it was a police transport .
he said no policemen were on the bus , adding that the attackers had committed a " ghastly mistake " .
the death toll is expected to rise since the attack took place in an area where there were no medical facilities , the associated press news agency reported .
forest hideout the latest attack comes after police killed five rebels , including two women , in the area on sunday and security forces were continuing to patrol the district .
the blast is reported to have take place in a forest where rebels have been hiding out with the support of local villagers .
but deputy swanga said the bus attack was likely to turn public opinion away from the rebels .

but not everyone is travelling in the same direction .
nanjie village , in the central province of henan , collectivised its agricultural production and industry in the mid 1980s - when the rest of the country was doing the opposite , introducing market reforms put forward by former leader deng xiaoping .
it continues to be run on maoist egalitarian lines and has become something of a tourist attraction because of its staunch adherence to the values of the past .
on the tv set in the local souvenir shop , a karaoke video is playing .
but the chinese characters changing colour across the screen as the music plays are not the usual sentimental love lyrics .
they are a song paying homage to chairman mao .
he is everywhere in this place in nanjie 's main square , a bus-load of tourists gathers around their guide at the foot of a giant white mao statue , flanked by portraits of marx , engels , lenin and stalin .
the local military brigade provides a pair of sentries to guard the statue around the clock .
but it quickly becomes clear that this place is about more than preserving revolutionary icons .
it is about trying to hang on to at least some old communist values in a fast-changing society .
and about finding a way around the seemingly intractable economic problems of rural china .
tourist trap a jostling crowd of village residents lines up to collect their regular quota of eggs .
they do not need to pay a cent for them .
they just take along their little red ration food distribution booklets .
" they also get meat and cooking oil and duck eggs and other commodities , " says one resident .
of course there are those who support what we 're doing and those who oppose it wang hongbin nanjie party chief it is the same for accommodation in modern tidy rows of apartment buildings , and for health care .
no wonder bus loads of tourists are coming to see .
" mao 's slogan ' to serve the people ' is really put into practice here .
it 's not just empty rhetoric , " says one woman tourist from chairman mao 's home province of hunan .
it all sounds almost too good to be true - and in a sense it is .
there is a whole cluster of factories and flour mills , which make nanjie village look more like a small industrial town .
they now make up the core of its collective economy .
but most of the work is done by migrant workers .
they outnumber the village residents by about 9,000 to 3,000 .
and the migrants do not get anything like the same deal as the locals .
" it 's true that the migrant workers ' pay and conditions are not as good as the village residents , " says nanjie 's party chief wang hongbin .
" but they want to come here to work and we 're giving them employment opportunities , so we 're benefiting the country and the people . "
changing times even with all that low cost labour , the village has recently been going through tough times as its main products like instant noodles and beer face stiff competition .
but ideologically , mr wang , who has become something of a cult personality , insists things are hale and hearty .
mao is out of fashion elsewhere in china he deftly brushes off any suggestion of a clash between the collective lifestyle of nanjie and deng xiaoping 's free market reforms .
" of course there are those who support what we 're doing and those who oppose it , " says mr wang .
" that 's quite normal .
" but those who oppose us are also helping us by posing questions for us to answer , which are beneficial to our development . "
in the surrounding countryside , it is clear that the nanjie approach has had some influence .
several villages have adopted a similar model , even though large-scale re-collectivisation of the economy remains a maoist dream .
china 's leaders have failed to give a significant boost to rural living standards .
and with capitalists now formally allowed to join the communist party , the leaders seem much more preoccupied with wooing the country 's emerging rich elite .
places like nanjie , which embody the old style collective values of the maoist era , may be out of fashion , but they are likely to keep a certain appeal .
