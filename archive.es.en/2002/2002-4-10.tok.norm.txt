here shoppers can find expensive fashion and luxurious accessories .
side streets lead off the main road to rows of period town houses .
yet since unification , this once magnificent avenue has faded somewhat , and an increasing number of exclusive shops and traditional cafes have been forced to close due to exorbitant rents .
instead , dozens of fast-food restaurants have taken their place .
wining and dining : hackescher markt and prenzlauer berg the area around the hackescher markt is the place to go to for small , exclusive , but still affordable restaurants offering a variety of international cuisine .
the hackescher höfe is an art nouveau residential complex , just a stone 's throw from the trendy district of prenzlauer berg .
here , the young and creative meet during the day for afternoon breakfasts , quick , creative lunches and late-night cocktails .
numerous cafés flank the pavements and galleries and small shops are tucked away in side streets .
in prenzlauer berg , the recent change berlin has undergone is more than obvious : up to two thirds of the pre-war apartment houses in the area have been thoroughly renovated and restored back to their original beauty .
house fronts have been freshly painted and stucco decorations around windows and doorwayss painstakingly repaired .
but some facades are still waiting for a face-lift : the newly refurbished houses are often right next to similar , but still grey , worn , houses .
on some of these , you can still see wartime bullet holes in the stone . back to first page back 2/3 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlin - the resurrected capital dw-world : designs on berlin picture of the day dw-tv europe live euromaxx - leben und kultur in europa we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.04.2002 a treasure returns to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : priceless 14th century windows will return to the marienkirche in frankfurt on the oder for more than half a century , 111 stained glass windows from a church in germany were locked up in a museum vault in russia .
now russia 's parliament has voted to give them back . pastor wolfgang töppen is a happy man .
for years , the retired cleric has been campaigning for the full restoration of the 14th century marienkirche -lrb- st. mary 's church -rrb- in the eastern german city of frankfurt on the oder .
last week , wolfgang töppen came a big step closer to his goal .
on friday , russia 's state parliament agreed to return more than 100 stained glass windows to the marienkirche .
the priceless 14th century windows had been taken to russia at the end of the second world war .
the russians considered them " trophy art " , just like millions of other cultural treasures seized from germany after world war ii .
for the russians , these treasures were a form of reparations for their war losses .
needless to say that germany sees things differently .
german churches , museums and cultural institutions have been fighting for years to get some of their long-lost treasures back .
and the german government has supported them in their struggle .
the possible return of " trophy art " has therefore often propped up on the agenda of german-russian summits .
" russian property " but three years ago , moscow officially declared all " trophy art " russian property – much to the dismay of the germans .
since then , russian museums have only rarely given individual items back .
the german side has acknowledged their good-will by helping restore russian artworks destroyed by the wehrmacht during the war .
or by giving financial aid .
which is why there could be a connection between friday 's decision to return the marienkirche windows and russian president vladimir putin 's visit to germany this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin the russian president -lrb- photo -rrb- will arrive in weimar on tuesday for two days of talks with members of the german government .
putin is due to negotiate russia 's economic debt .
frankfurt 's treasures but regardless of the political implications , the odyssey of the marienkirche windows before , during and after the second world war , is a very concise example of the entanglements of 20th century european history .
before the allies began bombing the eastern german city of frankfurt on the oder , the germans dismantled most of the precious interior of the marienkirche and put it into storage .
the stained glass windows were taken down in the summer of 1943 , photographed , catalogued and boxed .
as the soviet army approached on frankfurt on the oder , the boxes with the 14th century windows were taken to potsdam on the outskirts of berlin .
here they remained - tucked away safely until the capitulation of the third reich .
in the turmoil of the days that followed , the red army packed up the boxes with art treasures and took them to russia .
and for the next half century , their whereabouts remained a mystery .
frankfurt 's marienkirche in ruins by the end of the world war ii , the marienkirche in frankfurt on the oder had been largely destroyed .
only a few ruins survived the bombing raids .
in later years , the communist rulers of east germany wanted to tear the remains of the church down .
but the people of frankfurt on the oder stood up in protest .
they wanted to save and restore the marienkirche , one of germany 's largest gothic brick churches .
however , renovation of the church did n't really get under way until german reunification .
it was only in the 1990s , that the church finally got a new roof .
long-lost treasure re-discovered it was only after the demise of the soviet union that the people of frankfurt found out that their long-lost stained glass windows had survived the second world war .
the windows had been hidden away in the vaults of the hermitage museum in st. petersburg , russia , for over fifty years – and hardly anyone knew of their existence .
when pastor wolfgang töppen heard that the windows had n't been destroyed in the war , he started to campaign for their return .
but since " trophy art " is a sensitive issue in german-russian relations , the german foreign ministry asked him to keep things quiet .
for the next few years , both sides cooperated without making a lot of fuss .
since 2001 , specialists at the heremitage museum have been restoring some of the 14th century stained-glass treasures .
ties with western art historians intensified .
back in frankfurt by next year ?
frankfurt 's mayor wolfgang pohl hopes the windows will be back in place in the marienkirche by next year , when the city celebrates its 750 year anniversary .
but for those who want to get a glimpse of these cultural treasures before they return to their place of origin in germany : the st. petersburg hermitage museum has put some of them on show in a special exhibit .
' ' marienkirche stained glass " focuses on 15 of the most spectacular windows .
the show closes september 1 , 2002 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic surveys today some argue that these works would n't have survived in their place of origin .
but others say all cultural treasures should be where they originated .
do you think works of art that were taken to another country should be returned to their place of origin ?
yes .
art is part of a country 's cultural heritage .
no .
there may be reasons against it .
i do n't know .

at one a.m. on that day , east german soldiers began rolling out barbed wire across the city under a secret plan dubbed " operation rose " .
berliners awoke that sunday morning to find themselves cut off from families , friends and jobs .
the ruling communists in the eastern part of the city wanted to stop the exodus of its citizens to the west .
prior to the wall , thousands of east berliners fled the soviet-controlled sector to enjoy the benefits of capitalism under the allied powers .
communist east germany also felt the need to seal off its nation from capitalist influence to ensure its ideology .
just a few weeks later , on september 22 , 1961 , the united states allied powers set up checkpoint charlie .
it was to become the cold war 's best-known border crossing between east and west .
the move responded to attempts by the east german regime to limit the free movement of the western allies solely to the sector crossing point at friedrichstrasse .
this was a violation of the " four powers " status of berlin - ruled by the united states , britain and france in the west and the soviet union in east berlin .
symbol of the cold war until the 155-kilometer berlin wall fell in 1989 , it was the definitive symbol of the cold war .
the impermeable barrier was reinforced with minefields , dogs and guards who shot to kill .
thousands tried to flee east germany to the west and hundreds of people died in their attempts to escape .
today , there are very few reminders of the wall in central berlin .
checkpoint charlie was removed on june 22 , 1990 .
only concrete sandbags and a reconstructed checkpoint mark the site next to the checkpoint charlie museum .
remnants of the wall itself are mainly found in berlin 's outer regions .
in central berlin , people began tearing down the historical structure in 1989 .

senior members of the royal family said their final farewells in a private service at st george 's chapel on tuesday .
millions silently remembered the queen mother across the uk it followed a day of national mourning during which more than a million people turned out to pay their respects along the funeral route and many more observed two minutes ' silence in the queen mother 's honour .

dr george carey told the congregation , and the many thousands listening to broadcasts across the world , that the queen mother was like the sun " bathing us in her warm glow " .
" we come here to mourn but also to give thanks , to celebrate the person and her life - both filled with such a rich sense of fun and joy and the music of laughter , " he said .

a poem by an unknown author helped set the tone of thanksgiving for the queen mother 's 101 remarkable years .
many have done excellently but you exceed them all dr george carey quoting proverbs it read : " you can shed tears that she is gone or you can smile because she has lived .
" you can close your eyes and pray that she 'll come back or you can open your eyes and see all she 's left . "
