"
they understand what is required of them and there is no need for further clarification or discussion " colin powell " the goal is not inspections for inspections ' sake , the goal has to be disarmament and removal of all capacity for weapons of mass destruction , " mr powell said in manila at the start of his visit to the philippines .
" the iraqis have constantly tried to find their way around their obligations with respect to inspections . "
" they understand what is required of them and there is no need for further clarification or discussion , " mr powell said , adding that the us continued to insist on regime change in baghdad .
brief talks earlier , us national security council spokesman sean mccormack said that any discussion on renewed inspections should be " very short " .
" what he -lrb- saddam -rrb- should say is : ' yes , i accept any time , anywhere , any place unfettered inspections ' , " he said .
for his part , un secretary general kofi annan gave a cautious welcome to iraq 's invitation for the head of the weapons inspection team to visit baghdad .
however , a spokesman for mr annan warned that the procedure proposed by the iraqis was " at variance " with the methods agreed by the un security council .
no decision will be taken on a response to the invitation until a council meeting next week .
speculation has been growing about a possible attack on iraq by the us , which alleges that saddam hussein is developing weapons of mass destruction .
the bbc 's jon leyne in washington says the us administration has been careful to play down the significance of an iraqi offer it views with deep scepticism , and president george w bush has left the capital for the weekend without commenting on it .
other members of the un security council appear to be divided over the offer - russia and france welcomed it but britain is sceptical .
the letter from the iraqi foreign minister , naji sabri , was sent to mr annan on thursday inviting the chief inspector , hans blix , for what was called " technical talks " .
skilled negotiators the bbc 's greg barrow , at the united nations , says the last thing un officials want to do is to rush into making a response - they know that the iraqis are skilled negotiators .
arms inspection timeline feb 1991 : gulf war ends - iraq subjected to un sanctions and arms inspections jan 1998 : iraq blocks mission , accuses inspectors of spying for us feb 1998 : kofi annan reaches deal with baghdad oct 1998 : iraq ceases co-operation with unscom nov 1998 : inspectors return to iraq dec 1998 : un pulls out inspectors - us air strikes begin dec 1999 : unscom replaced by unmovic jul 2002 : un-iraq talks end without deal aug 2002 : iraq invites unmovic chief to baghdad the un will want to know exactly where such discussions are going to lead .
our correspondent says that , despite their obvious caution , officials still want to believe that the iraqis are moving towards a return of inspectors after an absence of more than four years .
un inspectors left iraq in 1998 , complaining of a lack of co-operation from the iraqi government .
news of the iraqi invitation caused global oil prices to fall on friday , as traders saw the move as reducing the chances of military conflict in the middle east .
verification of iraqi weapons programmes is a key condition for the lifting of un sanctions imposed after iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 .

the death penalty wil be abolished , the ban on education and broadcasts in kurdish lifted .
final parliamentary confirmation came after a marathon all-night session , and now only requires the formality of presidential approval to become law .
nationalist deputies strongly opposed the moves , seeing them as a concession to kurdish rebels and their 15-year campaign for autonomy in the south-east of the country .
" we are happy that the death penalty is being lifted in turkey , " embattled prime minister bulent ecevit said after the vote .
" it is important that the eu 's door opens up for turkey . "
kurdish reform the death penalty will be replaced by life imprisonment without parole , although it will remain on the statute books in wartime .
the change will save the life of jailed kurdish leader abdullah ocalan .
the largest group in parliament , the nationalist action party , made ocalan 's execution the centre of its 1999 election campaign .
no executions have been carried out since 1984 , although dozens of people are on death row .
members of the party told parliament that the families of those killed by the rebel kurdish pkk were watching the debate .
turkey 's reform package end the death penalty allow kurdish broadcasts and education end penalties for criticism of state institutions ease restrictions on public demonstrations ease restrictions for foreign organisations working in the country toughen measures against illegal immigration greater freedom for non-muslim minoriy religions but such arguments failed to deter deputies from abolishing the death penalty by a large majority - a move which set the mood for further votes .
early on saturday , parliament legalised kurdish radio and television broadcasts - one of the most controversial elements of the reform package , which ends years of severe state restrictions .
the country 's estimated 12 million kurds will also be allowed to have private kurdish-language education .
the bbc 's jonny dymond in istanbul says that to its supporters , the death penalty has been a sign of turkey 's resolve against terrorism , and to its opponents , a sign of state brutality and backwardness .
experts say that supporters of the reforms want to adopt the whole package before campaigning starts for the general election on 3 november .
turkey wants the eu to set a firm date by the end of the year when the country can start membership talks .
but brussels insists reforms should be passed and implemented before it could consider such a move .

during the first weekend of august , the us city is hosting the annual defcon hacker conference which is running a competition to see who can find the most wireless networks .
during the conference , teams of eager hackers will be driving the streets touting laptops fitted with software that can spot the wireless networks .
if the networks in las vegas are anything like those in other cities around the world , then many of the networks the teams find will be doing little to protect themselves against unwanted visitors .
packet play back in the days when hackers only had the phone network to play with , many curious technology enthusiasts conducted " wardialling " expeditions .
this involved making their computer modem dial through a long list of numbers to find out which ones responded with data dialtones .
crisp cans are used as antennas to help find networks with the advent of wireless technologies that let people connect up computers with radio , hackers have adapted and now embark on " wardriving " expeditions .
wardriving involves scouring an area for the wireless networks .
they can be easy to spot because many broadcast their presence to make it easy for computers to link in .
" most wardriving is really done for sport , " said geoff davies , managing director of security company i-sec .
" it 's very much become a pastime to see what kind of things you can pick up . "
earlier this year mr davies ' firm showed how a crisp can could be used to pinpoint the location of wireless networks .
software to spot wireless networks and capture key information about them is readily available online .
collecting points a wardriving competition is being held as part of the annual defcon conference which takes place in las vegas between 2-4 august .
under the rules of the competition teams of hackers will be given two hours to drive around and spot wireless networks .
points will be awarded to teams for each network they find and extra points will be given for those found with their basic security systems turned off .
if a team finds a wireless net that no-one else does they get five points .
the team with the most points at the end of the two hour drive around wins .
the location of each network must be logged using gps co-ordinates so the defcon organisers can check the find .
the competition is being judged by pete shipley , the man who invented wardriving .
better software unfortunately surveys carried out by i-sec and others have found that many of the wireless networks are not doing enough to make them secure .
mr davies said many were unwittingly giving people high-speed access to the net and , in the worst cases , were potentially leaving sensitive company data open to scrutiny by outsiders .
he added that the publicity about insecure wireless networks was starting to make people work harder to protect them .

during the first weekend of august , the us city is hosting the annual defcon hacker conference which is running a competition to see who can find the most wireless networks .
during the conference , teams of eager hackers will be driving the streets touting laptops fitted with software that can spot the wireless networks .
if the networks in las vegas are anything like those in other cities around the world , then many of the networks the teams find will be doing little to protect themselves against unwanted visitors .
packet play back in the days when hackers only had the phone network to play with , many curious technology enthusiasts conducted " wardialling " expeditions .
this involved making their computer modem dial through a long list of numbers to find out which ones responded with data dialtones .
with the advent of wireless technologies that let people connect up computers with radio , hackers have adapted and now embark on " wardriving " expeditions .
wardriving involves scouring an area for the wireless networks .
they can be easy to spot because many broadcast their presence to make it easy for computers to link in .
" most wardriving is really done for sport , " said geoff davies , managing director of security company i-sec .
" it 's very much become a pastime to see what kind of things you can pick up . "
earlier this year mr davies ' firm showed how a crisp can could be used to pinpoint the location of wireless networks .
software to spot wireless networks and capture key information about them is readily available online .
collecting points a wardriving competition is being held as part of the annual defcon conference which takes place in las vegas between 2-4 august .
under the rules of the competition teams of hackers will be given two hours to drive around and spot wireless networks .
points will be awarded to teams for each network they find and extra points will be given for those found with their basic security systems turned off .
if a team finds a wireless net that no-one else does they get five points .
the team with the most points at the end of the two hour drive around wins .
the location of each network must be logged using gps co-ordinates so the defcon organisers can check the find .
the competition is being judged by pete shipley , the man who invented wardriving .
better software unfortunately surveys carried out by i-sec and others have found that many of the wireless networks are not doing enough to make them secure .
mr davies said many were unwittingly giving people high-speed access to the net and , in the worst cases , were potentially leaving sensitive company data open to scrutiny by outsiders .
he added that the publicity about insecure wireless networks was starting to make people work harder to protect them .
" certainly a lot of people who are using wireless have woken up to it and have taken action , " he said .
now products are starting to appear , such as bluesocket and reefedge , which corral wireless networks behind their own firewall .

protest groups say that a flotilla of dozens of boats will meet the ships once they approach the irish sea .
our correspondent james helm has been to see the ships ' sister vessel in port at barrow-in-furness in cumbria . "
from the outside the pacific crane looks like any other cargo vessel .
but this ship carries nuclear fuel and its two armed sister ships , currently sailing round the world , are heading for britain and a storm of protest .
inside the vessel , we were shown the hold where nuclear material is stored .
the steel walls are double thickness .

british nuclear fuels ltd insist their ships are safe and secure but many environmental campaigners are n't convinced .
they 're promising protests once the vessels approach uk and irish waters .
there have already been demonstrations the ships sailed from japan and again in australian waters .
the ships ' cargo is mixed uranium and plutonium oxide - so called mox .
environmentalists claim there is enough on board to make 50 nuclear weapons .
greenpeace says the cargo is dangerous and could be a target for terrorists .
the fuel will eventually come to sellafield , which has a new mox reprocessing plan officials there are keen to calm fears .
jack allen , the head of the mox plant at sellafield says : " the plutonium in mox is encapsulated in a ceramic form which is very safe .
and the transport we are using is very high security and well done . "
the irish environment minister martin cullen disagrees .
he 's disturbed by the level of risk attached to the whole operation .
" any of us , no matter where we live will be deeply concerned about the possibility of something going wrong with one of these shipments , given what the cargo is on board and the potential damage to the environment and human life . "

as part of its campaign to promote the t68i mobile phone with add-on camera , sonyericsson has hired 120 actors to play tourists and invite passers-by to take their picture using the new multimedia phone .
critics have hailed it as the ultimate in guerrilla marketing but sonyericsson insists the 60-day campaign is all in good fun .
it is , however , making a serious investment of $ 5 million in the strategy which will run in seven us cities and see the actor-tourists targeting attractions such as the empire state building in new york and the space needle in seattle .
' young and cool ' some of the actors will hang out in bars using the phones picture sending facilities .
the company said actors will only pass on information about the phone if asked by the members of the public .
according to jon maron , director of marketing at sonyericsson , the firm went to some lengths to look for young people that had an interest in technology .
" they are not just actors and actresses .
they 're the young , cool people in the areas where they live , " mr maron said .
outselling cameras mobile phones with built-in cameras are proving popular with consumers and offering a ray of light to an otherwise depressed electronic manufacturing industry .
according to research firm strategy analytics , 16 million camera phones will be sold worldwide in 2002 and by 2007 they will outstrip conventional digital cameras .
the firm predicts 147 million camera phones will be sold in 2007 , compared with 95 million digital cameras .
" camera phones will be an essential tool in driving handset replacement sets in the next five years , " said senior analyst neil mawston .
