he ’ s not the only one who ’ s fed up : an “ anti-moan ” manifesto is making the rounds of german cyberspace . the german economy is in a slump ; unemployment has reached astronomical heights ; the social welfare system is breaking down ; the environment has been destroyed .
in short , the sky is falling . given all that negative news that 's constantly being bandied around by the media these days , germans have taken to indulging in their favorite pastime - complaining or " jammern " as it 's called in german - with a vengeance . whether it 's a podium discussion , a media talkshow or a a conversation overheard at the local supermarket , it 's hard to miss the unmistakable whining tone as germans grumble about everything from tax hikes to growing unemployment to price rises in the railway system . there is , however , some hope in this scenario of gloom and doom that has seized germany . some germans , fed up with the constant carping , are mobilizing against the lament of their fellow countrymen and women . on sunday president johannes rau said in an interview that his compatriots moan too much for their own good , despite living in one of the wealthiest and safest countries in the world . no " valley of tears " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau “ we live in a world of split reality , ” rau -lrb- left -rrb- said of germany .
“ there is an enormous number of booked holidays , and retailers report rising turnover ahead of christmas - so you see that we are not living in a valley of tears . ” early this month president rau , whose position is largely ceremonial , criticized germany for being the most self-absorbed country in the world .
he was responding to an outpouring of discontent from thousands of germans who sent shirts to the federal chancellery in december .
the protest was meant to symbolize government tax increases taking the very shirts off people ’ s backs . but rau also appealed to the media and political elites not to take advantage of the negative atmosphere .
he criticized the main political parties , in particular , for continually squabbling with each other since the september election rather than taking on their proper roles .
“ what i ’ m not seeing is the government governing and the opposition acting as opposition , ” he pointed out . enough hysteria to counter the malaise in german society , future scientist matthias horx has launched the anti-moan manifesto , calling for an “ enlightened , sceptical optimism that takes a sober but open approach to the country ’ s current problems . ”
over a thousand supporters , including prominent germans from politics and business , have already signed the manifesto , which is available online . “ what we don ’ t need is the moaning of functionaries , trade unionists , unsuccessful managers and ideological gamblers , ” admonishes porsche boss wendelin wiedeking , one of germany ’ s most prominent anti-complainers . the head of the car rental company sixt too , has had it with the moaners : “ i criticize the government too , but at some point the complaining has to end , ” erich sixt says . matthias horx has an explanation for germans ’ behavior : “ complaining pays off in our luxuriantly giving social state . ”
if you cry loud enough you can expect increases in subsidies , he believes . risky business but there are real dangers to such behavior . according to economic experts , germans ’ negativity can have an effect on the economy .
“ the current pessimism is as contagious as the optimism of the new economy a few years ago , ” analyst joachim goldberg told the german financial times . germans may think things look bad now , but financial analysts worry that if they don ’ t start looking on the bright side the disaster that prophets of doom predict may become a self-fulfilling prophecy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the lie committee a parliamentary committee has been founded to examine alleged electoral fraud .

europe is anxious to catch up with the u.s. in the field of science .
at the union 's biggest research conference ever the eu is launching a 17.5 billion euro program to coordinate r & d among the 15 member states . some 8000 scientists , government officials and business leaders are meeting in brussels from november 11 – 13 for the largest research conference ever held under eu auspices .
there they will be able to share ideas and information as part of the european union 's research framework program . the european commission aims to change the fact that the eu lags behind the u.s. when it comes to scientific research and development by pumping 17.5 billion euros into cultivating a truly european research environment over the next four years .
the research framework program will focus on financing projects in the fields of space and aeronautics , biotechnology , genomics and food safety . poor cooperation up until now though , inter-european cooperation has been the exception rather than the rule .
the problems are numerous . professor hans-jörg bullinger of germany 's fraunhofer institute told dw-tv of specific problems in the field of stem cell research . " in different countries we have different regulations , " he said .
" the research that is done in the lab of one country can not be conducted in a similar way in another country . " stem cell research relies on cell clusters removed from human embryos when they are between four and six days old .
in sweden the embryos are created expressly for research purposes .
the country 's scientists use the cells in their search for cures for serious illnesses such as parkinson 's disease and multiple sclerosis .
swedish scientists also export many of the stem cell lines - though not to germany . after a lengthy debate earlier this year the german parliament decided to prohibit the import of stem cells .
so german stem cell researchers , like bonn-based oliver brüstle , can only use imported cells extracted before january 1 , 2002 .
brüstle is still waiting for the central ethics commission to approve his application , first submitted in 1999 , to be able to work with the imported cells . hans jörg bullinger believes that the solution is a unified european research policy : " as we have it on the political side , we also need it on the research side . " too little money european investment in research and development also lags behind u.s. spending .
at the brussels conference , eu science commissioner philippe busquin pointed out that european spending on scientific research makes up a mere 1.9 percent of the eu 's gdp .
as opposed to that , the americans devote 2.7 percent of gdp towards research and development while japan tops the list with 3 percent of its gdp spent on research projects .
determined not to lag behind , in march this year the european commission pledged to raise its investment to 3 percent by 2010 . the discrepancy can be overcome according to professor bullinger : " if you look at the amount that is invested in the u.s. , it is much more than we can do in a single country in europe .
but if we have a unified european research strategy , we have a good opportunity that in certain segments we will come to a similar research position as we see in the united states . not all bad in other fields though , european scientists have developed successful collaborative research projects .
funded by the european union , " siberia ii " aims to provide precise data on greenhouse gases and their interactions with climate change .
the knowledge scientists are gaining by analyzing the northern zone of siberia could make climate predictions more reliable in the future . the project 's coordinator , christiane schmullius from the friedrich schiller university in jena , explains : " we work with 14 partner institutions , and each one specializing in a certain area .
for instance , one institute in vienna looks at ground moisture dynamics , one in france deals with maps of biomass , and another analyses snow parameters .
those are all problems unto themselves , and no institute could handle them all itself .

europe is anxious to catch up with the u.s. in the field of science .
at the union 's biggest research conference ever the eu is launching a 17.5 billion euro program to coordinate r & d among the 15 member states . some 8000 scientists , government officials and business leaders are meeting in brussels from november 11 – 13 for the largest research conference ever held under eu auspices .
there they will be able to share ideas and information as part of the european union 's research framework program . the european commission aims to change the fact that the eu lags behind the u.s. when it comes to scientific research and development by pumping 17.5 billion euros into cultivating a truly european research environment over the next four years .
the research framework program will focus on financing projects in the fields of space and aeronautics , biotechnology , genomics and food safety . poor cooperation up until now though , inter-european cooperation has been the exception rather than the rule .
the problems are numerous . professor hans-jörg bullinger of germany 's fraunhofer institute told dw-tv of specific problems in the field of stem cell research . " in different countries we have different regulations , " he said .
" the research that is done in the lab of one country can not be conducted in a similar way in another country . " stem cell research relies on cell clusters removed from human embryos when they are between four and six days old .
in sweden the embryos are created expressly for research purposes .
the country 's scientists use the cells in their search for cures for serious illnesses such as parkinson 's disease and multiple sclerosis .
swedish scientists also export many of the stem cell lines - though not to germany . after a lengthy debate earlier this year the german parliament decided to prohibit the import of stem cells .
so german stem cell researchers , like bonn-based oliver brüstle , can only use imported cells extracted before january 1 , 2002 .
brüstle is still waiting for the central ethics commission to approve his application , first submitted in 1999 , to be able to work with the imported cells . hans jörg bullinger believes that the solution is a unified european research policy : " as we have it on the political side , we also need it on the research side . " too little money european investment in research and development also lags behind u.s. spending .
at the brussels conference , eu science commissioner philippe busquin pointed out that european spending on scientific research makes up a mere 1.9 percent of the eu 's gdp .
as opposed to that , the americans devote 2.7 percent of gdp towards research and development while japan tops the list with 3 percent of its gdp spent on research projects .
determined not to lag behind , in march this year the european commission pledged to raise its investment to 3 percent by 2010 . the discrepancy can be overcome according to professor bullinger : " if you look at the amount that is invested in the u.s. , it is much more than we can do in a single country in europe .
but if we have a unified european research strategy , we have a good opportunity that in certain segments we will come to a similar research position as we see in the united states . not all bad in other fields though , european scientists have developed successful collaborative research projects .

europe is anxious to catch up with the u.s. in the field of science .
at the union 's biggest research conference ever the eu is launching a 17.5 billion euro program to coordinate r & d among the 15 member states . some 8000 scientists , government officials and business leaders are meeting in brussels from november 11 – 13 for the largest research conference ever held under eu auspices .
there they will be able to share ideas and information as part of the european union 's research framework program . the european commission aims to change the fact that the eu lags behind the u.s. when it comes to scientific research and development by pumping 17.5 billion euros into cultivating a truly european research environment over the next four years .
the research framework program will focus on financing projects in the fields of space and aeronautics , biotechnology , genomics and food safety . poor cooperation up until now though , inter-european cooperation has been the exception rather than the rule .
the problems are numerous . professor hans-jörg bullinger of germany 's fraunhofer institute told dw-tv of specific problems in the field of stem cell research . " in different countries we have different regulations , " he said .
" the research that is done in the lab of one country can not be conducted in a similar way in another country . " stem cell research relies on cell clusters removed from human embryos when they are between four and six days old .
in sweden the embryos are created expressly for research purposes .
the country 's scientists use the cells in their search for cures for serious illnesses such as parkinson 's disease and multiple sclerosis .
swedish scientists also export many of the stem cell lines - though not to germany . after a lengthy debate earlier this year the german parliament decided to prohibit the import of stem cells .
so german stem cell researchers , like bonn-based oliver brüstle , can only use imported cells extracted before january 1 , 2002 .
brüstle is still waiting for the central ethics commission to approve his application , first submitted in 1999 , to be able to work with the imported cells . hans jörg bullinger believes that the solution is a unified european research policy : " as we have it on the political side , we also need it on the research side . " too little money european investment in research and development also lags behind u.s. spending .
at the brussels conference , eu science commissioner philippe busquin pointed out that european spending on scientific research makes up a mere 1.9 percent of the eu 's gdp .
as opposed to that , the americans devote 2.7 percent of gdp towards research and development while japan tops the list with 3 percent of its gdp spent on research projects .
determined not to lag behind , in march this year the european commission pledged to raise its investment to 3 percent by 2010 . the discrepancy can be overcome according to professor bullinger : " if you look at the amount that is invested in the u.s. , it is much more than we can do in a single country in europe .
but if we have a unified european research strategy , we have a good opportunity that in certain segments we will come to a similar research position as we see in the united states . not all bad in other fields though , european scientists have developed successful collaborative research projects .
funded by the european union , " siberia ii " aims to provide precise data on greenhouse gases and their interactions with climate change .
the knowledge scientists are gaining by analyzing the northern zone of siberia could make climate predictions more reliable in the future . the project 's coordinator , christiane schmullius from the friedrich schiller university in jena , explains : " we work with 14 partner institutions , and each one specializing in a certain area .
for instance , one institute in vienna looks at ground moisture dynamics , one in france deals with maps of biomass , and another analyses snow parameters .
those are all problems unto themselves , and no institute could handle them all itself .

there they will be able to share ideas and information as part of the european union 's research framework program . the european commission aims to change the fact that the eu lags behind the u.s. when it comes to scientific research and development by pumping 17.5 billion euros into cultivating a truly european research environment over the next four years .
the research framework program will focus on financing projects in the fields of space and aeronautics , biotechnology , genomics and food safety . poor cooperation up until now though , inter-european cooperation has been the exception rather than the rule .
the problems are numerous . professor hans-jörg bullinger of germany 's fraunhofer institute told dw-tv of specific problems in the field of stem cell research . " in different countries we have different regulations , " he said .
" the research that is done in the lab of one country can not be conducted in a similar way in another country . " stem cell research relies on cell clusters removed from human embryos when they are between four and six days old .
in sweden the embryos are created expressly for research purposes .
the country 's scientists use the cells in their search for cures for serious illnesses such as parkinson 's disease and multiple sclerosis .
swedish scientists also export many of the stem cell lines - though not to germany . after a lengthy debate earlier this year the german parliament decided to prohibit the import of stem cells .
so german stem cell researchers , like bonn-based oliver brüstle , can only use imported cells extracted before january 1 , 2002 .
brüstle is still waiting for the central ethics commission to approve his application , first submitted in 1999 , to be able to work with the imported cells . hans jörg bullinger believes that the solution is a unified european research policy : " as we have it on the political side , we also need it on the research side . " too little money european investment in research and development also lags behind u.s. spending .
at the brussels conference , eu science commissioner philippe busquin pointed out that european spending on scientific research makes up a mere 1.9 percent of the eu 's gdp .
as opposed to that , the americans devote 2.7 percent of gdp towards research and development while japan tops the list with 3 percent of its gdp spent on research projects .
determined not to lag behind , in march this year the european commission pledged to raise its investment to 3 percent by 2010 . the discrepancy can be overcome according to professor bullinger : " if you look at the amount that is invested in the u.s. , it is much more than we can do in a single country in europe .
but if we have a unified european research strategy , we have a good opportunity that in certain segments we will come to a similar research position as we see in the united states . not all bad in other fields though , european scientists have developed successful collaborative research projects .
funded by the european union , " siberia ii " aims to provide precise data on greenhouse gases and their interactions with climate change .
the knowledge scientists are gaining by analyzing the northern zone of siberia could make climate predictions more reliable in the future . the project 's coordinator , christiane schmullius from the friedrich schiller university in jena , explains : " we work with 14 partner institutions , and each one specializing in a certain area .
for instance , one institute in vienna looks at ground moisture dynamics , one in france deals with maps of biomass , and another analyses snow parameters .
those are all problems unto themselves , and no institute could handle them all itself .

europe is anxious to catch up with the u.s. in the field of science .
at the union 's biggest research conference ever the eu is launching a 17.5 billion euro program to coordinate r & d among the 15 member states . some 8000 scientists , government officials and business leaders are meeting in brussels from november 11 – 13 for the largest research conference ever held under eu auspices .
there they will be able to share ideas and information as part of the european union 's research framework program . the european commission aims to change the fact that the eu lags behind the u.s. when it comes to scientific research and development by pumping 17.5 billion euros into cultivating a truly european research environment over the next four years .
the research framework program will focus on financing projects in the fields of space and aeronautics , biotechnology , genomics and food safety . poor cooperation up until now though , inter-european cooperation has been the exception rather than the rule .
the problems are numerous . professor hans-jörg bullinger of germany 's fraunhofer institute told dw-tv of specific problems in the field of stem cell research . " in different countries we have different regulations , " he said .
" the research that is done in the lab of one country can not be conducted in a similar way in another country . " stem cell research relies on cell clusters removed from human embryos when they are between four and six days old .
in sweden the embryos are created expressly for research purposes .
the country 's scientists use the cells in their search for cures for serious illnesses such as parkinson 's disease and multiple sclerosis .
swedish scientists also export many of the stem cell lines - though not to germany . after a lengthy debate earlier this year the german parliament decided to prohibit the import of stem cells .
so german stem cell researchers , like bonn-based oliver brüstle , can only use imported cells extracted before january 1 , 2002 .
brüstle is still waiting for the central ethics commission to approve his application , first submitted in 1999 , to be able to work with the imported cells . hans jörg bullinger believes that the solution is a unified european research policy : " as we have it on the political side , we also need it on the research side . " too little money european investment in research and development also lags behind u.s. spending .

he ’ s not the only one who ’ s fed up : an “ anti-moan ” manifesto is making the rounds of german cyberspace . the german economy is in a slump ; unemployment has reached astronomical heights ; the social welfare system is breaking down ; the environment has been destroyed .
in short , the sky is falling . given all that negative news that 's constantly being bandied around by the media these days , germans have taken to indulging in their favorite pastime - complaining or " jammern " as it 's called in german - with a vengeance . whether it 's a podium discussion , a media talkshow or a a conversation overheard at the local supermarket , it 's hard to miss the unmistakable whining tone as germans grumble about everything from tax hikes to growing unemployment to price rises in the railway system . there is , however , some hope in this scenario of gloom and doom that has seized germany . some germans , fed up with the constant carping , are mobilizing against the lament of their fellow countrymen and women . on sunday president johannes rau said in an interview that his compatriots moan too much for their own good , despite living in one of the wealthiest and safest countries in the world . no " valley of tears " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau “ we live in a world of split reality , ” rau -lrb- left -rrb- said of germany .
“ there is an enormous number of booked holidays , and retailers report rising turnover ahead of christmas - so you see that we are not living in a valley of tears . ” early this month president rau , whose position is largely ceremonial , criticized germany for being the most self-absorbed country in the world .
he was responding to an outpouring of discontent from thousands of germans who sent shirts to the federal chancellery in december .
the protest was meant to symbolize government tax increases taking the very shirts off people ’ s backs . but rau also appealed to the media and political elites not to take advantage of the negative atmosphere .
he criticized the main political parties , in particular , for continually squabbling with each other since the september election rather than taking on their proper roles .
“ what i ’ m not seeing is the government governing and the opposition acting as opposition , ” he pointed out . enough hysteria to counter the malaise in german society , future scientist matthias horx has launched the anti-moan manifesto , calling for an “ enlightened , sceptical optimism that takes a sober but open approach to the country ’ s current problems . ”
over a thousand supporters , including prominent germans from politics and business , have already signed the manifesto , which is available online . “ what we don ’ t need is the moaning of functionaries , trade unionists , unsuccessful managers and ideological gamblers , ” admonishes porsche boss wendelin wiedeking , one of germany ’ s most prominent anti-complainers . the head of the car rental company sixt too , has had it with the moaners : “ i criticize the government too , but at some point the complaining has to end , ” erich sixt says . matthias horx has an explanation for germans ’ behavior : “ complaining pays off in our luxuriantly giving social state . ”
if you cry loud enough you can expect increases in subsidies , he believes . risky business but there are real dangers to such behavior . according to economic experts , germans ’ negativity can have an effect on the economy .
“ the current pessimism is as contagious as the optimism of the new economy a few years ago , ” analyst joachim goldberg told the german financial times . germans may think things look bad now , but financial analysts worry that if they don ’ t start looking on the bright side the disaster that prophets of doom predict may become a self-fulfilling prophecy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the lie committee a parliamentary committee has been founded to examine alleged electoral fraud .

brüstle is the first scientist to apply to the rki , which is responsible for processing applications to import the cells , and to receive permission since the restrictive law that regulates the practice was introduced in april 2002 . brüstle himself told the news agency afp that he was “ very relieved ” by the positive news .
he had feared that a decision on his application would not come until sometime in 2003 .
brüstle announced that he expects the cells - which will come from israel - to reach bonn in january .
the research project would begin immediately thereafter .
the neurobiologist ’ s research focuses on the treatment of brain and spinal diseases , such as parkinson ’ s . controversial research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebryonale stammzelle , grafik , stem cell brüstle ’ s request for twelve stem cell lines in august 2000 created a furor in germany and sparked a passionate debate in society and parliament .
his application was delayed three times , while discussion continued about whether and how to regulate importing stem cells . in public appearances brüstle repeatedly warned that germany would be unable to keep up with the international scientific community if it banned stem cell research .
until now he has been limited to carrying out his experiments on mice . a further scientist , wolfgang-michael fritz of the university of munich , also got the go-ahead to use human stem cells in his research .
the doctor aims to use cardiac muscle cells for transplantations in the treatment of heart attacks . the rki has three more applications from scientists for stem cell imports to decide on . restrictive measures in april 2002 germany ’ s parliament decided to restrict the import of stem cells .
only embryonic cell lines which existed prior to january 2002 may be imported for scientific research .
cells must have been derived from surplus embryos produced by artificial fertilization .
furthermore , the research and the import must be approved by a supervisory board , which is obliged to refuse permission if similar research with non-embryonic cells could produce equally useful results . opposition came in particular from religious leaders .
the conference of german bishops , for example , said that in passing the law the government no longer guarantees the fundamental right to life and the unlimited protection of humans from the moment of conception . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wanted : a unified european research policy europe is anxious to catch up with the u.s. in the field of science .

europe is anxious to catch up with the u.s. in the field of science .
at the union 's biggest research conference ever the eu is launching a 17.5 billion euro program to coordinate r & d among the 15 member states . some 8000 scientists , government officials and business leaders are meeting in brussels from november 11 – 13 for the largest research conference ever held under eu auspices .
there they will be able to share ideas and information as part of the european union 's research framework program . the european commission aims to change the fact that the eu lags behind the u.s. when it comes to scientific research and development by pumping 17.5 billion euros into cultivating a truly european research environment over the next four years .
the research framework program will focus on financing projects in the fields of space and aeronautics , biotechnology , genomics and food safety . poor cooperation up until now though , inter-european cooperation has been the exception rather than the rule .
the problems are numerous . professor hans-jörg bullinger of germany 's fraunhofer institute told dw-tv of specific problems in the field of stem cell research . " in different countries we have different regulations , " he said .
" the research that is done in the lab of one country can not be conducted in a similar way in another country . " stem cell research relies on cell clusters removed from human embryos when they are between four and six days old .
in sweden the embryos are created expressly for research purposes .
the country 's scientists use the cells in their search for cures for serious illnesses such as parkinson 's disease and multiple sclerosis .
swedish scientists also export many of the stem cell lines - though not to germany . after a lengthy debate earlier this year the german parliament decided to prohibit the import of stem cells .
so german stem cell researchers , like bonn-based oliver brüstle , can only use imported cells extracted before january 1 , 2002 .
brüstle is still waiting for the central ethics commission to approve his application , first submitted in 1999 , to be able to work with the imported cells . hans jörg bullinger believes that the solution is a unified european research policy : " as we have it on the political side , we also need it on the research side . " too little money european investment in research and development also lags behind u.s. spending .
at the brussels conference , eu science commissioner philippe busquin pointed out that european spending on scientific research makes up a mere 1.9 percent of the eu 's gdp .
as opposed to that , the americans devote 2.7 percent of gdp towards research and development while japan tops the list with 3 percent of its gdp spent on research projects .
determined not to lag behind , in march this year the european commission pledged to raise its investment to 3 percent by 2010 . the discrepancy can be overcome according to professor bullinger : " if you look at the amount that is invested in the u.s. , it is much more than we can do in a single country in europe .
but if we have a unified european research strategy , we have a good opportunity that in certain segments we will come to a similar research position as we see in the united states . not all bad in other fields though , european scientists have developed successful collaborative research projects .

so german stem cell researchers , like bonn-based oliver brüstle , can only use imported cells extracted before january 1 , 2002 .
brüstle is still waiting for the central ethics commission to approve his application , first submitted in 1999 , to be able to work with the imported cells . hans jörg bullinger believes that the solution is a unified european research policy : " as we have it on the political side , we also need it on the research side . " too little money european investment in research and development also lags behind u.s. spending .
at the brussels conference , eu science commissioner philippe busquin pointed out that european spending on scientific research makes up a mere 1.9 percent of the eu 's gdp .
as opposed to that , the americans devote 2.7 percent of gdp towards research and development while japan tops the list with 3 percent of its gdp spent on research projects .
determined not to lag behind , in march this year the european commission pledged to raise its investment to 3 percent by 2010 . the discrepancy can be overcome according to professor bullinger : " if you look at the amount that is invested in the u.s. , it is much more than we can do in a single country in europe .
but if we have a unified european research strategy , we have a good opportunity that in certain segments we will come to a similar research position as we see in the united states . not all bad in other fields though , european scientists have developed successful collaborative research projects .
funded by the european union , " siberia ii " aims to provide precise data on greenhouse gases and their interactions with climate change .
the knowledge scientists are gaining by analyzing the northern zone of siberia could make climate predictions more reliable in the future . the project 's coordinator , christiane schmullius from the friedrich schiller university in jena , explains : " we work with 14 partner institutions , and each one specializing in a certain area .
for instance , one institute in vienna looks at ground moisture dynamics , one in france deals with maps of biomass , and another analyses snow parameters .
those are all problems unto themselves , and no institute could handle them all itself . " europe may have a long way to go before it can keep pace with the u.s. in the field of science , but if the conference in brussels is anything to go by , it seems determined to make a step in that direction . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the eu 's research framework program radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

brüstle is the first scientist to apply to the rki , which is responsible for processing applications to import the cells , and to receive permission since the restrictive law that regulates the practice was introduced in april 2002 . brüstle himself told the news agency afp that he was “ very relieved ” by the positive news .
he had feared that a decision on his application would not come until sometime in 2003 .
brüstle announced that he expects the cells - which will come from israel - to reach bonn in january .
the research project would begin immediately thereafter .
the neurobiologist ’ s research focuses on the treatment of brain and spinal diseases , such as parkinson ’ s . controversial research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebryonale stammzelle , grafik , stem cell brüstle ’ s request for twelve stem cell lines in august 2000 created a furor in germany and sparked a passionate debate in society and parliament .
his application was delayed three times , while discussion continued about whether and how to regulate importing stem cells . in public appearances brüstle repeatedly warned that germany would be unable to keep up with the international scientific community if it banned stem cell research .
until now he has been limited to carrying out his experiments on mice . a further scientist , wolfgang-michael fritz of the university of munich , also got the go-ahead to use human stem cells in his research .
the doctor aims to use cardiac muscle cells for transplantations in the treatment of heart attacks . the rki has three more applications from scientists for stem cell imports to decide on . restrictive measures in april 2002 germany ’ s parliament decided to restrict the import of stem cells .
only embryonic cell lines which existed prior to january 2002 may be imported for scientific research .
cells must have been derived from surplus embryos produced by artificial fertilization .
furthermore , the research and the import must be approved by a supervisory board , which is obliged to refuse permission if similar research with non-embryonic cells could produce equally useful results . opposition came in particular from religious leaders .

he ’ s not the only one who ’ s fed up : an “ anti-moan ” manifesto is making the rounds of german cyberspace . the german economy is in a slump ; unemployment has reached astronomical heights ; the social welfare system is breaking down ; the environment has been destroyed .
in short , the sky is falling . given all that negative news that 's constantly being bandied around by the media these days , germans have taken to indulging in their favorite pastime - complaining or " jammern " as it 's called in german - with a vengeance . whether it 's a podium discussion , a media talkshow or a a conversation overheard at the local supermarket , it 's hard to miss the unmistakable whining tone as germans grumble about everything from tax hikes to growing unemployment to price rises in the railway system . there is , however , some hope in this scenario of gloom and doom that has seized germany . some germans , fed up with the constant carping , are mobilizing against the lament of their fellow countrymen and women . on sunday president johannes rau said in an interview that his compatriots moan too much for their own good , despite living in one of the wealthiest and safest countries in the world . no " valley of tears " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau “ we live in a world of split reality , ” rau -lrb- left -rrb- said of germany .
“ there is an enormous number of booked holidays , and retailers report rising turnover ahead of christmas - so you see that we are not living in a valley of tears . ” early this month president rau , whose position is largely ceremonial , criticized germany for being the most self-absorbed country in the world .
he was responding to an outpouring of discontent from thousands of germans who sent shirts to the federal chancellery in december .
the protest was meant to symbolize government tax increases taking the very shirts off people ’ s backs . but rau also appealed to the media and political elites not to take advantage of the negative atmosphere .
he criticized the main political parties , in particular , for continually squabbling with each other since the september election rather than taking on their proper roles .
“ what i ’ m not seeing is the government governing and the opposition acting as opposition , ” he pointed out . enough hysteria to counter the malaise in german society , future scientist matthias horx has launched the anti-moan manifesto , calling for an “ enlightened , sceptical optimism that takes a sober but open approach to the country ’ s current problems . ”
over a thousand supporters , including prominent germans from politics and business , have already signed the manifesto , which is available online . “ what we don ’ t need is the moaning of functionaries , trade unionists , unsuccessful managers and ideological gamblers , ” admonishes porsche boss wendelin wiedeking , one of germany ’ s most prominent anti-complainers . the head of the car rental company sixt too , has had it with the moaners : “ i criticize the government too , but at some point the complaining has to end , ” erich sixt says . matthias horx has an explanation for germans ’ behavior : “ complaining pays off in our luxuriantly giving social state . ”
if you cry loud enough you can expect increases in subsidies , he believes . risky business but there are real dangers to such behavior . according to economic experts , germans ’ negativity can have an effect on the economy .
“ the current pessimism is as contagious as the optimism of the new economy a few years ago , ” analyst joachim goldberg told the german financial times . germans may think things look bad now , but financial analysts worry that if they don ’ t start looking on the bright side the disaster that prophets of doom predict may become a self-fulfilling prophecy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the lie committee a parliamentary committee has been founded to examine alleged electoral fraud .

the leadership of the finance ministry 's international division - the job usually termed " japan 's financial diplomat " - is passing to zembei mizoguchi from haruhiko kuroda .
initially there is expected to be little shift in policy .
mr mizoguchi is unlikely to be any more vocal than mr kuroda in his concern over the damage a strong yen could do to japan 's vital export sector .
but with domestic demand still flat , and deflation - steadily falling prices - eating away at any prospect of recovery , mr mizoguchi 's role will be an important one .
he has been one of the key voices in the finance ministry warning against the rise in the yen .
off the boil for the moment , japan 's trade still looks healthy , with exports in november rising 19.2 % from the previous year to 4.6 trillion yen -lrb- £ 24bn ; $ 38.2bn -rrb- .
but since then the changeover in the us has catalysed a slide in the dollar .
currency dealers bet that mr o 'neill 's replacement , john snow , will allow the administration to back away from the us 's traditional " strong dollar " policy .
weak economic data , rising oil prices and the fear of war in iraq are also contributing to the slide , which saw the yen strengthen to above 120 to the dollar on monday for the first time in a month .
" mr yen " mr kuroda has been in post longer than most japanese bureaucrats , kept there to avoid a shake-up while the government was formulating its reform plans for bank bad debts and other problems .
mr mizoguchi , 58 , was the hot tip as his successor .
if he does start to use his roving role to comment on the yen - and vice finance minister toshiro muto hinted on tuesday that " appropriate action " was on the cards - he will be following in the footsteps of a famous predecessor .
before mr kuroda took over , the job was filled by eisuke sakakibara , whose note-perfect timing when commenting on what currency speculators were doing earned him the nickname " mr yen " .

transport 2000 says passengers have to cope with rising fares and inadequate services - especially in rural and suburban areas .
it has published a report describing buses as " the forgotten wing of public transport " , despite often being the only option for people without cars .
in response bus companies have admitted there is room for improvement but say passenger numbers are rising for the first time since world war ii .
' greatly improved ' the transport 2000 report calls for better regulation of services and greater funding to extend services and bring down fares .
it says that an extra £ 1bn has been spent in london and services have been greatly improved as a result .
bus service concerns poor services high fares too many cancellations lack of information poor maintenance inadequate security too few bus lanes in some areas the group wants local councils to take control of privatised buses .
it is also calling for the relaxation of competition laws to allow companies to co-operate where it would improve the service for passengers .
the pressure group claims that , while costs to motorists have stayed the same in real terms since 1974 , bus fares have gone up by 87 % .
in small and medium sized towns buses can be scarce outside shopping hours and often do not serve out of town businesses , transport 2000 says .

transport 2000 says passengers have to cope with rising fares and inadequate services - especially in rural and suburban areas .
it has published a report describing buses as " the forgotten wing of public transport " , despite often being the only option for people without cars .
in response bus companies have admitted there is room for improvement but say passenger numbers are rising for the first time since world war ii .
' greatly improved ' the transport 2000 report calls for better regulation of services and greater funding to extend services and bring down fares .
it says that an extra £ 1bn has been spent in london and services have been greatly improved as a result .
bus service concerns poor services high fares too many cancellations lack of information poor maintenance inadequate security too few bus lanes in some areas the group wants local councils to take control of privatised buses .
it is also calling for the relaxation of competition laws to allow companies to co-operate where it would improve the service for passengers .
the pressure group claims that , while costs to motorists have stayed the same in real terms since 1974 , bus fares have gone up by 87 % .
in small and medium sized towns buses can be scarce outside shopping hours and often do not serve out of town businesses , transport 2000 says .

the men led around 30,000 laid-off workers in several weeks of protests against the government and the managers of their factory in liaoyang city in the country 's north east .
two other leaders of the march demonstrations , yao fuxin and xiao yunliang , remain in custody .
large-scale demonstrations are still unusual in china but the country 's crumbling state-owned enterprises and increasing unemployment could spark increased unrest .
wide-scale corruption pang qingxiang and wang zhaoming are out of prison , but they are far from free .
this is a probationary release and they have been told that they are not to meet with other laid-off workers but instead to gather evidence against their fellow protesters .
most of the protesters in liaoyang worked for the city 's ferro-alloy factory , a bankrupt , state-owned enterprise .
when the factory closed , employees were promised pensions and back wages .
but they never materialised and many of the unemployed workers suspected the factory 's managers of massive embezzlement .
they took to the streets in china 's largest public demonstration in years .
the police eventually cracked down but across china state-owned companies are faltering , weighed down by bad business practices and corrupt managers .
in chinese cities , that has raised the unemployment rate to dangerous levels - perhaps as high as 15 % .
the government now has liaoyang under control , but in future it may have many more protests to deal with .
