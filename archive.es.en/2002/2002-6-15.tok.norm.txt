the genre has been popular for decades his became a household name in india after he shot dead a british police officer , mistaking him to be the one responsible for violently assaulting a nationalist leader in lahore in 1928 .

bhagat singh has emerged as a favourite hero of the directors and producers in bollywood , bombay 's sprawling movie industry that challenges hollywood 's position as the leader of the world 's movie-making pack .

dedicated freedom-fighter professor jagmohan singh , a nephew of the freedom fighter , says the film-makers have made some factual errors .

' money-spinners ' professor singh said bhagat singh 's stand on communalism and socialism too were not shown in the films .
bollywood is better known for romantic musicals " showing bhagat singh as a fundamentalist is the biggest distortion in these two films , " he said .
" this is like turning history into mystery for commercial benefit . "

another member of the family has already filed a petition to the punjab high court alleging that the films presented distorted versions of bhagat singh 's life .
the court has asked the producers and directors of the two the films to file their replies later this month .
meanwhile , a non-governmental organisation in delhi has alleged that film-makers are trying to cash in by using bhagat singh as a brand name .
in addition to the movies in question , another film on the man 's life was released last month while two others are awaiting release .
demonstrating the power of the genre as a commercial success , bollywood had already produced three earlier films on bhagat singh before the current spate hit the screens .

the insurer 's sun alliance & london fund , used by tens of thousands of homebuyers with endowment mortgages is at the centre of concern .
the fund also has an £ 847 million pounds liability for guaranteed annuity rates for pension customers .
with a huge amount of cash needed to meet its liabilities , the fund has just 20 % of its £ 9 billion pounds worth invested in shares - calling into question its long-term growth prospects .
annual bonuses on endowments and pensions have already been drastically cut .
rsa is the latest insurer to run into trouble after being hit by a combination of large insurance payouts and weak global markets .
two of its four investment funds are in particular trouble , both are with-profit funds with a combined worth of around £ 20 billion pounds .
with-profits funds pool investors ' money and pay returns in the form of bonuses - typically paid each year and then in the form of a final bonus when the policy matures .
in theory , investment returns are supposed to be guaranteed by a ' smoothing ' effect .
in good years , insurers should hold back some money for years when investment returns are low .
but the recent poor savings environment has exposed the fragility of some of these funds and led to questions about their management .
many insurers have slashed bonuses , and millions of endowment holders have been warned that they may not be able to pay off their mortgages .
policyholders with equitable life have been among the worst hit , after the insurer could no longer guarantee payments .
now some industry analysts are concerned that rsa could suffer a similar fate .
r & sa estimates it will lose up to £ 215m related to the destruction of new york 's world trade center after the 11 september attacks .
the company is also expecting to pay out up to £ 15m in claims over enron 's bankruptcy and £ 371m to claimants who have contracted diseases related to asbestos exposure .
to compound its misery , r & sa has said it intends to write to around 50,000 customers who may be entitled to compensation over the payment of guaranteed pensions .
the decision follows a ruling by the house of lords , which forced rival insurer equitable life to honour promises to its policyholders over guaranteed annuities .
the insurer 's two other funds , the r & sa linked assurance fund and the phoenix fund have so far not been affected by the crisis .

a group of around 25 students from lampeter university visited the monks on caldey island for a six-day course last month .
lampeter university launched the course this year caldey is famous as the site of one of britain 's earliest monasteries , and more recently has become the home to the cistercian brothers .
it has always been open to visits from tourists , with thousands visiting each year .
but this was the first time that students had been invited to whole-heartedly join their way of life .
the students - all postgraduates and including some from overseas - lived in the guesthouse attached to the island 's monastery .
as well as undergoing a series of lectures on monastic life , the visitors were able to join the monks at the cycle of seven daily services .
lecturer dr thomas o 'loughlin said the collaboration between lampeter university and the monks had been a great success .
" there was a clear synergy between the monks being able to give lectures to the students and the students join in the offices of the monastery , " said dr o 'loughlin .
the chance to get up at 3am and say psalms was just magical student ruth dyer one of the students who took part in the visit was ruth dyer , an ma student in celtic christianity .
" i found it absolutely marvellous , " said ms dyer .
" the cistercians showed us a life of great simplicity and stability where they decline wealth and live a life devoted to god .
" it was so different from my normal day-to-day life .
" the chance to get up at 3am and say psalms in the simple monastic church along with the monks was just magical . "
the six-day module is designed to be repeated next may .
the monks have often shown their readiness to embrace 21st century life .
after launching their own website and mail order business , last autumn they set up a " webshop " selling everything from perfume and chocolate to cds and books about island life .
another venture to help bring an income into the island community was in selling organic meat .

these reserves are based on very prudent assumptions , we continue to be comfortable with them and we have not had any discussions with the fsa or anyone else about a need to increase them .

the course at brunel university will look at wireless technology , software design as well as the social , cultural and business aspects of wireless communications .
new recruits " we 've devised this course to attract students back into engineering degree courses - so critical to the development of the mobile and wireless world of the 21st century , " said head of engineering , professor balachandran .
it is the ideal course for students who are interested in communication technology professor balachandran , brunel university he is hoping it will prove interesting to students who may not have considered an engineering course in the past .
" it is the ideal course for students who are interested in communication technology and are concerned that a traditional engineering course will require in-depth mathematics , " he said .
" students of this course will be able to play an active part in shaping the future of wireless technology . " 50 places will be available on the course which starts in september .

castro called bush ' liberator who nobody invited ' more than 129,000 voting stations have been set up in just a few days .
the referendum comes three days after president castro brought millions of people out onto the streets as part of a campaign to counter growing calls for democratic reforms to cuba 's communist government .
when faced with difficulties , few are better than president fidel castro at mobilising his people - he said 86 % of the population participated in rallies across the country on wednesday .
' resounding endorsement ' now , the cuban people are being asked to ratify an amendment agreed earlier in the week .
the move is a response to growing calls from both inside and outside cuba for president castro to initiate democratic reform .
cuban dissidents have presented an 11,000-name petition to the national assembly calling for greater civil liberties .
cuban officials have said it has little chance of success .
those dissidents have said that the cuban government 's response shows that it is scared of the growing calls for change .
and outside cuba , us president george bush said that washington would not lift its 40-year trade embargo and travel ban until it saw fundamental democratic reforms on the island .
announcing the referendum , president castro urged the cuban people to give mr bush - who he called " his liberator who nobody invited " - a strong and worthy response .
president castro said the voting was being organised by social groups and was not a state activity .
but nearly all social groups in cuba are closely linked to the state .
and there is little doubt that the vote will see a huge turnout , a resounding endorsement of the cuban government and political system and a strong but predictable condemnation from fidel castro 's enemies in washington and miami . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's richard forrest " castro was the first to sign the petition " see also : 12 jun 02 -pipe- americas cubans march in favour of socialism 26 jul 01 -pipe- americas one million mark cuba 's rebellion 21 may 02 -pipe- americas cuba condemns bush over embargo 20 may 02 -pipe- americas life under an embargo 09 may 02 -pipe- americas us and cuba 's complex relations internet links : us state department the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top americas stories now : us draws up second iraq resolution chicago club owners face charges peru 's ex-spy chief on public trial venezuela signs non-violence pact us plays down n korean threat us struggles to clear snow hacker breaches credit card security bolivian cabinet resigns links to more americas stories are at the foot of the page .

aberdeen considers that it is inappropriate to comment in detail on the proposals until they are finalised .
however , this statement is being issued to clarify matters .
progressive growth is a unit trust whose investment objective is to provide capital growth from investment primarily in zero dividend preference shares .
progressive growth was promoted under the banner " the one year old who lets you sleep at night " .
while this was a wholly accurate description at the time , aberdeen appreciates that subsequent market conditions have not enabled progressive growth to continue to fulfil this description .
a number of options are being considered for the delivery of aberdeen 's proposal , which is that progressive growth investors will receive no less than the value of their initial investment at a specific future date .
the details of aberdeen 's plans have not yet been finalised .
aberdeen hopes to finalise details in the course of the next two to three weeks .
aberdeen has taken the initiative with this proposal in recognition of the particular circumstances of progressive growth .
aberdeen has no intention of making any proposals for any other product .
aberdeen will announce full details in due course and plans to hold a series of meetings around the country to brief intermediaries , as well as writing to investors directly . "
