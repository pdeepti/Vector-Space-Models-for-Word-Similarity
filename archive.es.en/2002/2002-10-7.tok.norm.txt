the government has set a wide number of targets for the nhs since coming to power in 1997 .
strict targets these include maximum waiting times for hospital operations and outpatient appointments , waits in a & e and strict targets for people needing cancer treatment .
ministers have allocated money to these specific areas to help the nhs to meet the targets .
but the bbc survey reveals that in many cases the money never goes where it is supposed to .
more than one in three managers said they were personally aware of examples of money not going to its intended purpose .

others suggested they were bullied by senior colleagues and felt unable to raise their concerns .
" good people 's principles are being compromised because it 's only a brave person who can stand up for them and not lose the ability to pay their mortgage or maintain their families , " said one manager .

"
any wobble in the top line produces a severe squeeze in profits bob cotton , british hospitality association during the 1990s , culinary london abandoned its british reserve , exploding in a cornucopia of quesadilla , falafel , teppanyaki , goulash and goodness knows what else .
but while diners are smiling , the financiers behind london 's restaurant boom have developed a nasty case of indigestion .
for at least a year , the capital has been gripped by the worst restaurant slump for a decade , and things may get worse before they get better .
selling up in recent weeks , the slump has started to convulse the broad - and for a while , seemingly invulnerable - middle market .
on 1 october , luke johnson announced a buy-out offer for signature restaurants , of which he is chairman .
the tuesday evening rush a week earlier , the firm - whose portfolio runs from beer-and-mussels chain belgo to the upmarket ivy and le caprice - had announced the closure of half-a-dozen outlets , and said it was for sale , declaring that it saw no end to the restaurant recession .
at the same time , steak-frites chain chez gerard also put up the for-sale sign , and stepped up the pace of closures .
a year ago , the firm said it would have 40 outlets by june 2002 .
now , it has just 24 .
the two group 's travails mirror a constant rumble of bad news over the summer , including the failure of fish , a swanky seafood chain , and stagnating sales at pizza express , the firm that barely put a foot wrong for 30 years .
eating 's out so far , restaurant executives have tended to pin the blame on foot-and-mouth or september 11 .
if only it were that simple .
certainly , the froth on the london restaurant scene - free-spending tourists and flash city workers - has been blown off by september 11 and the global economic slowdown .
but the industry 's core domestic market has also ground to a halt .
britons spent £ 20.8bn on eating out in 2001 , according to the british hospitality association -lrb- bha -rrb- , the same amount as in 1997-98 , now seen as the peak of the market .
price problems stagnant sales would be far less of a problem if costs had not shot through the roof .
you ca n't get the staff these days nick mackintosh , a former restaurateur , says he used to spend some £ 25,000 a year renting a site in chiswick - a smart london suburb - in the 1990s .
now , he says , chiswick rents have risen to £ 80,000 or more .
and wages , once a negligible item , now account for up to one-third of a london restaurant 's costs .
the combination of minimum-wage legislation and central london 's near-zero unemployment level has driven catering wages up by more than 10 % this year alone .
with these costs " any wobble in the top line produces a severe squeeze in profits " , says bob cotton , bha chief executive .
growing pains not that restaurateurs are entirely blameless .
it would be impossible to get a table at the ivy , recession or no recession peter harden , harden 's guides the optimism of the 1990s encouraged headlong expansion - london 's restaurant population grew by 30 % in a decade , some observers say .
chez gerard leapt from running half-a-dozen outlets at the start of the 1990s to a peak of 31 this year .
belgo went almost berserk with optimism , opening branches as far afield as jersey , dublin and new york .
" the chains expanded far too exuberantly during the good years , " says peter harden , founder of the harden 's restaurant guide series .
" and now they are suffering for it . "
a nicer class of problem at the michelin-starred end of the market , the economics are less clear cut .
the waiting list for dinner at posh joints such as gordon ramsay , nobu and the ivy is still a month or more .
click here for more on waiting lists the celebrities and international jet-setters on which - according to legend - these establishments rely are seen as largely immune to the vagaries of the global economy .
" it would be impossible to get a table at the ivy , recession or no recession , " mr harden says .
but behind the fixed smiles , observers reckon the pain has reached such top outlets too .
their cost bases is massively higher than the industry average , and tourism statistics hint that individual spending levels have fallen faster than customer numbers .
on the bright side ...
the beneficiary of all this , of course , is the consumer .
once-haughty restaurants are getting friendlier - le caprice may still turn you away , but with charm and tact .
the recession-proof end of the market while the big , homogeneous chains are suffering , says nick mackintosh , " small , cosy neighbourhood restaurants are on their way back " .
and there is a greater emphasis on value .
even the swankiest eateries offer £ 10-20 set lunches , and bargain hunters are bombarded with newspaper meal-deal vouchers and other freebies .
for the restaurateurs , meanwhile , humble pie seems to be the dish of the day .
how long do you have to wait to get a square meal ?
in a wholly unscientific attempt to take the temperature of the market , bbc news online rang around six of the capital 's swankiest restaurants .
your correspondent asked whether a table for two would be available for dinner on tuesday evening and , if rebuffed , enquired about subsequent nights .
here are the results : at gordon ramsay , arguably the capital 's best-regarded restaurant , there was no chance .
" book at least a month in advance , " we were told .
do n't even think about it at nobu , there was the same result , except that our correspondent was put on hold for four minutes first as " all our operators are busy " .
a kinder rebuff from le caprice , with the vague advice to " book as far ahead as possible " .
three minutes of hanging on the telephone to tante claire , maybe london 's top pure french restaurant , brought a surprising result .
your correspondent was easily accommodated that night , without even having to specify a time .
another unhesitating " yes " from le gavroche .
at the ivy , a restaurant celebrated more for its a-list clientele than its a-list food , the phone was permanently engaged .
none of this is necessarily significant .
top restaurants use smoke and mirrors to maintain their reputations for exclusivity , sometimes even turning bookings away when tables lie empty .

it 's not a question of threat , it 's a reality carlos ghosn , president and chief executive , nissan motor in an interview with bbc news online , mr ghosn made it clear that the plant 's future would depend on whether the uk adopted the euro .
" we are worried about having our cost base in pounds and to have our revenue base in euros , " he said .
" this is a situation we do n't like .
" we had this situation when we decided to make the investments on the micra . "
" we ended up deciding to make the micra in sunderland , " mr ghosn added , referring to the company 's £ 235m -lrb- $ 369m -rrb- investment in january last year to build the model in the north of england .
" when the next investments come in the next couple of years , we hope we do n't have to go through the same kind of analysis , " mr ghosn said in a thinly veiled call for uk membership of the euro .
" obviously , that is not our decision .
it 's the decision of the uk government .
" that 's why it 's our duty to express our difficulties and our hopes and let them make the decisions . "
nissan presented the new micra for the first time at the paris motor show a week ago .
reality when asked whether he was threatening to shift production abroad unless the uk joined the euro , mr ghosn responded : nissan 's sunderland factory : europe 's most efficient " no , it 's a reality .
it 's not a question of threat , it 's a reality that we will take this into consideration each time we have to make an investment . "
" we would like , as much as possible , to have sunderland producing a lot of cars , but at the same time making cars that would allow us to make a profit . "
this would be easier if nissan 's exchange-rate risks could be minimised or eliminated .
but mr ghosn declined to say whether he thought this could be achieved without the uk joining the euro .
" we do n't discuss how -lsb- this -rsb- should be achieved , we discuss our objective , " he said .
competitive advantage two years ago , nissan decided to produce the micra in sunderland rather than in france where both its costs and its revenues would be in euros .
mr ghosn : soon to be in charge of renault too in a close decision , sunderland was chosen because it was , and still is , europe 's most efficient car manufacturing plant .
" so the only concern we have in sunderland is not about the plant but about this -lsb- exchange-rate -rsb- environment , " mr ghosn said .
after all , the micra - 1.3 million of which have been sold in the last decade - is crucial to nissan 's future in europe .
" the micra is a very important car for us , " mr ghosn said .
" it 's going to represent practically one third of all our sales in europe . "
no compromise nissan wants the new micra to return profits almost immediately , mr ghosn said .
i said immediately that i would be keeping my job as president and chief executive of nissan and at the same time become president and chief executive of renault carlos ghosn " if we thought that it would be very difficult to make money out of the micra in europe , frankly we would not have done it , " he said .
" we 're not in a business where we have to be here to occupy market share or to make volume .
" we 're in the business to create value , and nissan has a very strong policy that all the cars going on the market have to be profitable . "
powerful it was such unsentimental , straight talk that earned this brazilian-born frenchman the nickname " le costcutter " when , three years ago , he was wheeled in by renault to pull nissan back from the brink .
the french car company holds 44.4 % of nissan 's shares .
among the results of his efforts were the huge efficiency improvements made in sunderland .
and , off course , he has delivered profits .
in the fiscal year to 31 march , nissan made record net profits of 372bn japanese yen -lrb- £ 1.9bn ; $ 3bn -rrb- , up 12 % on the previous year .
mr ghosn 's performance has elevated him to the position of heir to renault 's president and chief executive louis schweitzer who will step down in 2005 .

monday 's operation is backed up by teams of police and dvla officials operating spot checks at sites across the country looking for motorists with no tax , mot certificate or insurance , or with faults on their vehicle .
gwent police are leading the two-week crackdown .
there are an estimated 81,000 unlicensed vehicles in wales , the majority of them in the more built-up areas in the south .

the ' stingray ' cameras are visible to passing motorists and can read the number plates of vehicles travelling at up to 100 miles per hour .
they were first introduced in england a year ago and are also operated in parts of scotland and northern ireland .
the dvla is running the scheme in conjunction with all four welsh police forces .
the cameras will operate from laybys and over bridges , reading the number plates of passing vehicles .
offenders will face fines of up to £ 1,000 for a car or motorbike , and up to £ 23,000 for a heavy goods vehicle .
crushed wheelclamping of cars without tax discs has been in force across the uk since 1997 .
so far , 99,000 vehicles having been targeted and 51,000 of them have been disposed of by crushing .
new regulations will also come into force for wheel-clamped vehicles which reduces the time clamped vehicles are kept in storage from 35 to 14 days .
after that time , unclaimed vehicles will be crushed .

delighted because their candidate , luis inacio lula da silva -lrb- known simply as lula -rrb- , has topped the poll in the presidential election - after three previous defeats .
nervous because he did not win outright and faces a potentially tricky second round at the end of october .
lula is now expected to win the presidency in the second round in theory , lula has little reason to worry .
the third and fourth-placed candidates were both from the centre-left and most of their supporters should opt for lula in the second round .
but brazilian voters can be fickle .
in a straight fight between lula and the government-backed candidate , jose serra , mr serra will no longer have to watch his back .
he will emphasise his own experience as a government minister and lula 's lack of it - the former trade unionist has never held an executive post .
mr serra may also find it easier to capitalise on the more popular aspects of the present cardoso administration .
swing to left but whatever the result , one thing is clear - brazil 's political geography has shifted sharply towards the left .
throughout the country , left and centre-left candidates have performed well in elections for state governorships and congress .
president cardoso governed in coalition with a right wing now in tatters whoever eventually wins the presidency will almost certainly be looking to form a centre-left coalition .
the brazilian right is in tatters .
that is a historic shift because it means that the centrist and leftist parties that together fought against brazil 's military government in the 1970s and 1980s will be united once again .
for the past eight years , president cardoso , although himself a social democrat , chose to govern in alliance with the right because he felt that only they could provide support for economic reforms .
now the balance of forces has shifted .
reasons for success there are many reasons for the left 's success .
it is partly because left-wing candidates are generally seen as less corrupt .
radical change is demanded by some such as these litter protesters it is also because they have often shown themselves to be responsible administrators at local level , with more imaginative ideas .
and it shows that the power of the old right-wing political bosses to bring in the votes from the interior of the country is fading .
although many on the brazilian left have radical ideas for change , it is unclear just how radical a new centre-left coalition will be .
neither lula nor mr serra has any desire to antagonise financial markets and risk a debt default .
both would like to kick-start the economy .
problems ahead these two objectives may be incompatible .
if lula wins , he will be forced to accept tight fiscal discipline for at least his first year in office .
lula may find his toughest challenges come once he is elected president he may already be wondering what scraps of radicalism he can throw to his supporters .
many of them have high expectations which will be disappointed .
there is a fundamental disagreement within brazil about where the origins of the country 's problems lie .
most supporters of the workers ' party feel the problem is within capitalism itself .
they believe the country has tried too hard to please financial markets , keeping interest rates high and depressing domestic demand .
they would like more state spending .
spending plans but most economists say brazil 's chief economic problem is connected with the role of the state .
they say the state already spends a great deal - on the wrong things .
even if he wins , lula may not be able to deliver on all his promises they want public sector pensions cut and education spending redirected away from universities towards primary and secondary schools .
only once the public finances are sorted out , they say , can brazil grow .
lula may accept some of this analysis .
but many of his supporters work in the public sector and would resist such reforms tooth and nail .
lula - if he wins the presidency - faces some tough choices , as well as the immediate challenge of steering brazil through rocky financial waters .

delighted because their candidate , luis inacio lula da silva -lrb- known simply as lula -rrb- , has topped the poll in the presidential election - after three previous defeats .
nervous because he did not win outright and faces a potentially tricky second round at the end of october .
in theory , lula has little reason to worry .
the third and fourth-placed candidates were both from the centre-left and most of their supporters should opt for lula in the second round .
but brazilian voters can be fickle .
in a straight fight between lula and the government-backed candidate , jose serra , mr serra will no longer have to watch his back .
he will emphasise his own experience as a government minister and lula 's lack of it - the former trade unionist has never held an executive post .
