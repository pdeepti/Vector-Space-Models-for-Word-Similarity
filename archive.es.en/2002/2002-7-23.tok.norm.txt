but human rights groups are angry at the sponsored training that indonesian soldiers could now get with us cash .
imet and indonesia us first gave training in 1952 programme suspended in 1999 senate committee now approved $ 400,000 for 2003 scheme the us senate 's appropriations committee passed an amendment to lift restrictions on the indonesian forces taking part in the pentagon 's international military education and training -lrb- imet -rrb- programme .
there are still several stages to go before the bill becomes law , but the approval of $ 400,000 for indonesia to take part in the imet scheme is the first move towards warming military ties since they were severed in 1999 in protest against violence by jakarta-backed militia in east timor .
a spokesman for the indonesian military , major-general sjafrie sjamsoeddin , told the jakarta post newspaper that the senate decision was welcomed , but details of the training to be offered still had to be worked out .
" i guess the working group will first of all ask for non-combat strategy training from the us military , " he said .
" but since combating terrorism has become our commitment , maybe we can exchange experiences with the us in dealing with this issue . "
' enables understanding ' indonesia 's top security minister , susilo bambang yudhoyono , also greeted the nascent warming of ties .
" imet programmes are good because they also enable the united states to understand the logic of conflicts in indonesia , " he said .
an american official in jakarta had warned that the continued violence in the northern province of aceh could affect the resumption of military ties .
the indonesian armed forces and the separatist guerrilla free aceh movement blame each other for attacks which leave , on average , 10 people dead every day .
the army ... is involved in drug smuggling , prostitution , human trafficking , illegal logging and many other illicit enterprises us senator patrick leahy munir , founder of indonesia 's most prominent human rights organisation kontras , said the us congress action was " a very dangerous move " .
" the military badly needs this endorsement from the united states in order to further legitimise its meddling in politics -lsb- and -rsb- human rights violations , " he said .
the approval of the change in the us senate was not unanimous , with senator patrick leahy speaking against the renewed funding .
mr leahy , who sponsored the suspension of the imet programme until indonesia brought to justice those guilty of human rights abuses in east timor , said there had not been enough change .
" the army ... is involved in drug smuggling , prostitution , human trafficking , illegal logging and many other illicit enterprises , " he said .

expansion at heathrow , gatwick and stansted airports is being considered , along with the development of regional airports .
environmental campaigners are concerned , but the confederation of british industry says that nearly ninety percent of the businesses , it surveyed want airport capacity to be increased .
breakfast 's max foster was at heathrow airport .
he said the following options are what the transport secretary , alistair darling , will most likely be proposing : well he could significantly expand airport capacity in the southeast - which some would argue is already overcrowded anyway - he could build new runways at heathrow , stansted , luton and / or gatwick .
a radical proposal could be for a whole new airport . the most likely place for that being cliffe in kent .
however , the focus wo n't be just on the southeast - growth is also expected to be encouraged elsewhere : birmingham airport could be expanded or even moved east of the city .
glasgow or edinburgh could be developed into hubs .
click here to watch our interview with john stewart .
john stewart from hacan clearskies spoke on breakfast .
he said : " it will mean more planes and more noise . "
it will mean more planes , more noise .
the proposed additional runway at heathrow will mean many more londoners will experience misery .
for the first time local community groups , environment and academic groups are joining together to fight this .
click here to watch our interview with baroness dean we also heard from baroness brenda dean who is the chair of the freedom to fly coalition .
she believes jobs and tourism could suffer without an expansion of britain 's airports .
" we ca n't put a lid on expansion . "
we need an expansion in the south-east .
we need to use our regional airports more .
tourism , jobs and environmental issues are important things to balance .
safety and security are things we have to also consider .
we ca n't put a lid on expansion , it will affect our competitiveness and would not create jobs .
we need to use technology to produce quieter planes .
uk air passenger numbers are expected to more than double from 180m a year to 400m by 2020 , making some expansion of capacity seem likely .
there are suggestions a new airport could be built near the river thames at cliffe in north kent .
a new runway at gatwick is another idea that could be suggested but any changes there are likely to be delayed until 2019 when a non-expansion agreement runs out .
southampton and luton airports could also see expansion .
the government 's consultation document could propose converting defunct raf bases into civilian airports .
raf finningley in yorkshire is one of the bases that has been touted .
if converted it could provide an international airport for doncaster .
new transport secretary alistair darling will unveil the proposals , which come from a series of regional studies , to mps on tuesday .
white paper the proposals will go out to consultation ahead of the publication of the government 's white paper on aviation due next year .
" doing nothing is not an option , " said a whitehall source .
but friends of the earth attacked the proposals even before they had been made public , saying the government 's regional studies were " flawed and rigged " .
new campaign group airportwatch , which launched last week , said the government should be looking at reducing the amount of air travel as the increased demand simply could not be met .
any preferences ?
the heathrow anti-noise group hacan clearskies said : " you would have thought that labour would have worked out an aviation policy having been in power for more than five years . "
the group added that the government had " preferences but are just testing the water .
mr darling address mps on tuesday " the government should look seriously at a coastal airport option , but they could be putting cliffe in only to rule it out later . "
" we would be utterly opposed to an extra , third runway at heathrow .
" we believe airlines , particularly british airways , are putting pressure on to get a third heathrow runway , but that the government prefers an extra runway at stansted . "
british airways chief executive rod eddington said : " i hope the government will publish its white paper soon - committing to building much-needed infrastructure .
" government knows that we in the uk are falling behind mainland europe .
i hope it will rectify this . "

while the city 's previous olympic bids might have been laughed at , manchester has emerged from its past to re-invent itself through sport .
" the heart of the city had been ripped out by the bomb , " mr bernstein told bbc news online . "

" what we saw that day was devastation , sheer devastation .
" but within six months we got the city centre up and running again . "
while he would never suggest the ira did the city a favour , mr bernstein says the destruction enabled the city 's rejuvenation , which would normally have taken 30 years , to be completed in six .
enthusiasm is not confined to the town hall , and people on the street appear to feel just as excited .
madeleine thorpe , 19 , from stockport , says : " it 's going to be good for the city and for the continuing recovery of rundown areas . "
there is even enthusiasm among communities plagued by gang-related gun violence .
michael mcfarquar , who grew up in longsight , set up gangstop earlier this year , a campaign to bring an end to " the escalating levels of gang culture " .
peoples ' council he says the £ 600m invested in the city as a result of the games has led to better communication .
" people are now starting to realise that they can participate in community meetings , " says mr mcfarquar , who is setting up an " independent peoples council " to ensure communities maintain a strong voice in the city .
in the once depressed industrial neighbourhood around sportscity , a couple of miles outside the city centre in beswick , people are also looking to the future .
doreen burns , who lives in the shadow of the games ' " jewel in the crown " venue - the city of manchester stadium - welcomes the event .
" this has been the spark that has set up everything else that has improved the area , " she says , from her doorstep in biscay close .
families who are being re-housed as homes are demolished to make way for the rejuvenation also appear happy .
may dixon , 61 , says : " i 'm definitely happy about the fact i 'm moving , though that is also because the derelict houses next door are regularly getting vandalised . "
games boycotted however , while the city might be feeling a sense of communal euphoria about the games , not everyone is embracing it .
some members of city ethnic communities say they feel sidelined .
the african women 's art and cultural development -lrb- awad -rrb- group , a national network that has a branch in longsight , is boycotting the games .
the branch 's founder , mama toro , says the group 's ideas have been ignored , despite suggesting a raft of ideas for its involvement .
" we were told the commonwealth games is only here for two weeks , so there is nothing for the community to do , " she says .
" we 're part of the commonwealth ourselves and we ca n't spend two weeks doing things to improve it . "
such disillusionment is not a common feeling in manchester at the moment .
but political leaders will have to consolidate the urban renewal programme , which secured the city the games , to stop disenchantment spreading once the hangover from the event kicks in .

the number of internet users grew by 12 million to 45.8 million during the six months to the end of june , according to the china internet network information centre .
this compares with 7.2 million new internet users in the previous six months , giving a total of 33.7m at the end of last year .
china ranks number three in the world , with only the united states and japan having more internet users , the report said .

beijing also plans to order licensed net cafés to install software which can prevent access to up to 500,000 foreign websites .
