german art historians say they may have found three long-lost drawings by peter paul rubens , a flemish artist of the 17th century . sometimes it 's good to move house : while you 're packing everything in boxes , you 're automatically taking stock of all the things you own .
you 'll undoubtedly find things you 've totally forgotten because they 've been tucked away for ages .
when the wallraf-richartz-museum in cologne , germany , prepared to move into a new building in the spring of 2000 , it also cleared out its drawers and archives .
and one of the things it discovered is turning into a sensation .
what art historian 's dreams are made of while sorting and packing the museum 's treasures , two art historians discovered drawings that could be priceless treasures .
in an old folder marked " waste " , they found three sketches that caught their eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drawings showed ancient roman statues .
it occurred to the art historians that they had seen similar sketches at museums in milan , moscow and dresden .
and these museums had attributed their drawings to the famed 17th century artist peter paul rubens .
could these be rubens originals as well ?
first , the art historians in cologne discussed the matter amongst themselves .
when they were convinced they might have found long-lost originals from the early 17th century , they started their detective work .
using state of the art computer technology , they compared their sketches to well-documented rubens originals .
all their tests pointed in the same direction : peter paul rubens .
what finally convinced them was the fact that their sketches were made on paper bearing the same water mark as other rubens drawings .
final confirmation but the cologne art historians want to be absolutely sure their newly discovered sketches are truly rubens originals .
they 're planning an international conference to discuss whether the works are authentic later this year in cologne .
and they 'll put the three drawings on display at the new wallraf-richartz-museum as part of a show called zeichnungsehen -lrb- seeing drawing -rrb- , which is due to open on march 14 , 2002 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : cologne museum enriched with priceless picassos the german city of cologne is home to many spectacular museums .

mr rumsfeld said the united states faced attacks far more deadly than those on 11 september , and should prepare for " the unknown , the uncertain , the unseen and the unexpected " .
these attacks could grow vastly more deadly than those we suffered on 11 september donald rumsfeld he said hundreds of thousands of americans could be killed if terrorists managed to get hold of unconventional weapons and deliver them with ballistic missiles .
mr rumsfeld 's comments , in a speech to the pentagon 's national defence university , came ahead of the formal unveiling on monday of president george w bush 's request for a massive boost in us defence spending .
the proposed increase would be the biggest requested since former president ronald reagan went cap in hand to congress during the cold war , 20 years ago .
dire warning " in the years ahead , it is likely that we will be surprised again by new adversaries who may also strike in unexpected ways , " mr rumsfeld said .
president bush has warned " rogue " states " and as they gain access to weapons of increasing power - and let there be no doubt they are - these attacks could grow vastly more deadly than those we suffered 11 september 11 . "
mr rumsfeld said the situation called for pre-emptive strikes .
" the best , and in some cases the only , defence is a good offence . "
the us had - ill-advisedly - postponed spending on spy planes and chemical and biological defence , mr rumsfeld said .
" that needs to change . "
spending boost president bush is requesting $ 379bn in defence spending in the fiscal year 2003 , up $ 48bn from this year .
following his state of the union address threat to iran , iraq and north korea - a trio he called an " axis of evil " - his security adviser condoleezza rice provided details of us plans on thursday .
she said the us would : work towards an international ban on the proliferation of dangerous weapons use its new friendship with russia to press for changes in rogue states push ahead with its plans for missile defence more than four months after the devastating attacks on new york and washington , the us remains on high alert .
the anthrax scare alerted officials to the threat of unconventional weaponry fbi director robert s mueller says this is because he believe there are " sleeper cells " of terrorists waiting for the command to attack .
mr mueller said interviews with captured al-qaeda fighters and documentary evidence found in afghanistan and elsewhere pointed to more potential attacks .
a government official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said two weeks ago intelligence services issued a warning of a possible attack on a nuclear plant or other nuclear facility .

in a report it criticises the culture department for its " wholly unacceptable " decision to offer dome bosses a guarantee against any losses .
the indemnity offered by the department demonstrated a lack of tranparency and " must not be repeated " , said conservative mp edward leigh , chairman of the public accounts committee .
the report also attacks the culture department for failing to acknowledge the financial problems of the dome until late in the day .
it goes on to say it was wrong to approve a target of 12 million admission-paying visitors , when planning on the basis of eight million had been recommended .
the department rejected the findings , claiming the indemnity was not a secret and many of the other findings were " old issues " .
public purse the guarantee of protection against losses was offered to the directors of the new millennium experience company -lrb- nmec -rrb- in june 2000 .
we should bear in mind that 6.5 million visitors enjoyed their time at the dome culture department spokesman it opened up for the first time the risk of voted money rather than national lottery money being for the dome project in greenwich , south london , according to the report .
the committee said : " in our view , the indemnity was outside the normal course of business and exposed the public purse to expenditure of such a nature and size that parliament should have been notified . "
but the culture department and the treasury did not report their actions to parliament as they considered an indemnity was already in place , it was claimed .
the report added : " if that is so , we find it surprising that no reference to such an existing indemnity was made in the letter which the department sent to the -lrb- nmec -rrb- directors . "
key findings among the other key findings of the report were : the organisational arrangements for the dome project were elaborate and complex and " gave rise to confusion and disagreement " .
the internal structure of nmec was not ideally suited to the task .
not until " late in the day " did nmec , the culture department and the millennium commission face up to the financial problems of the project .
in approving the dome target of 12 million admission-paying visitors , the millennium commissioners went against the advice of their own staff who recommended planning on the basis of eight million .
many more commercial opportunities could have been exploited if the marketing arrangements had been properly planned and managed .
delays in fitting out the dome meant few opportunities for trial running and nmec lacked senior staff with experience of running a large visitor attraction .
the effectiveness of marketing was constrained by uncertainty about the dome 's contents .
the company 's forecast for sponsorship income was too ambitious and there was no clear plan of how the parties would respond to a shortfall in income .
nmec failed to establish a " sufficiently robust regime of financial management " , with its finance team overstretched for most of 2000 .

a captive or killed danny can not speak for you , can not help you or your cause wall street journal email daniel pearl is being held by a group called the national movement for the restoration of pakistani sovereignty , which has given the us authorities until friday to meet its demands before they kill him .
the paper 's managing editor , paul steiger , and mr pearl 's wife thanked the group in an e-mail for extending the deadline , but said that killing mr pearl would do nothing to promote its cause .
mr pearl , 38 , went missing in the pakistani city of karachi on 23 january .
his captors have sent photographs showing him in captivity .
in one , a gun is being pointed at his head .
us secretary of state colin powell has ruled out any negotiations with the kidnappers , who are calling for better conditions for detainees held by the us at guantanamo bay in cuba .
mr steiger told mr pearl 's kidnappers that the extra time could be used to " start a true dialogue " and urged them to write back .
he went on : " a freed danny can explain your cause , and your beliefs , to the world .
" a captive or killed danny can not speak for you , can not help you or your cause . "
the group has also criticised the united states for not providing lawyers and trials for pakistanis detained on terrorism-related charges .
powell firm mr powell said the kidnappers ' demands were unacceptable .
he said various international visitors had confirmed that detainees at guantanamo bay were being treated humanely .
the national movement for the restoration of pakistani sovereignty sent an e-mail to pakistani and western media on thursday which read : " we will give you one more day . "
the bbc 's susannah price in islamabad says little is known about mr pearl 's captors .
she says it is not certain whether they exist at all or are just a front for another group or groups .
the former world heavyweight boxing champion muhammad ali - a muslim convert - has urged the kidnappers to treat mr pearl " with compassion and kindness " .
pakistani police say they are making progress in their investigations into the abduction .
they are questioning mubarak ali shah gilani - an islamic leader who heads a small militant group , tanzeem ul-fuqra , with whom mr pearl was trying to arrange an interview when he disappeared .

with protests remaining peaceful , more than 3,000 of the world 's political and business movers and shakers kickstarted the summit in the unaccustomed surroundings of bustling new york city .
like wagner 's music , the us economy is better than it sounds jacob frenkel president , merrill lynch international the shadow of 11 september hung heavy , and the executives and political leaders avidly debated the relationship between the economy and the " war on terrorism " .
many said they felt they had seen the back of the worst of the downturn .
" like wagner 's music , the us economy is better than it sounds , " said jacob frenkel , president of investment bank merrill lynch international .
" we will see a significant recovery in the us in the second half of the year , and that will pull the rest of the world with it . "
caution but stephen roach , chief economist at morgan stanley , said the economic fundamentals were " crummy " and the recession would show " a double dip in the spring . "
now that our global coalition against terrorism has been successful , we should use this to fight poverty , because terrorism and poverty are twins gloria arroyo president of the philippines and niall fitzgerald , chief executive of uk-based household goods multinational unilever , warned against over-confidence .
" i do n't think we 're going to see a quick recovery , " he said , noting the massive levels of debt in economies around the world .
" as there are more people out of work - and there will be - and problems in the financial markets continue , the debt will become a problem . "
the huge injection of stimulus into economies around the world could see a recovery in 2002 peter out in 2003 , he warned .
top to bottom but other speakers reminded delegates , most of whom come from rich countries , that they needed to remember that widening gap between rich and poor .
gloria arroyo , president of the philippines , said that without a concerted effort to tackle poverty both economic stability and success in the war against terrorism would remain out of reach .
the forum in based at the waldorf-astoria hotel " now that our global coalition against terrorism has been successful , we should use this to fight poverty , because terrorism and poverty are twins , " she said .
her advice echoed the words of other influential participants , who fear that political and business leaders from rich countries would prefer not to be bothered with the connections between unrest and international economic inequality .
in an interview with the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- , world bank president james wolfensohn warned that aid to poorer countries needed to be massively expanded .

many said they felt they had seen the back of the worst of the downturn .
" like wagner 's music , the us economy is better than it sounds , " said jacob frenkel , president of investment bank merrill lynch international .
