they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .
today , there are said to be 2,000 animals living in the area , and the number is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

ron sommer -lrb- left -rrb- and his successor helmut sihler .
the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .
details of the plan have already been leaked out to the german newsmagazine focus . first on the chopping block , according to the report , is telekom ’ s 1.9 billion euro marketing and advertising budget .
sihler and co. have plans to trim the budget by 400 million euro down to 1.5 billion euro . shedding excess baggage the company then must decide what assets it can sell .
top of the list are telekom ’ s television cable network that denver-based liberty media wanted to buy for 5.5 billion euro a few months back .
germany ’ s anti-trust office blocked that deal and telekom will most likely get no more than 3 billion for the network now , according to analysts . then there ’ s voicestream .
last week , telekom re-launched the voicestream brand as t-mobile in nevada and california .
the acquisition of the sixth-largest us wireless company was part of sommer ’ s ambition to spread the telekom brand worldwide . now t-mobile could very well be on the way out .
voicestream has been losing money and customers at a steady clip .
after paying 33 billion euro for the company in june 2001 , analysts believe telekom can get , at best , 10 billion euro for it now . job losses a reality last , but not least , is telekom ’ s workforce . the german company employs 260,000 people worldwide .
focus said the board may trim the german workforce alone by 22,000 . but german law prevents sihler from cutting too much in this area .
at least 25 percent of the former state company are considered civil servants and therefore can ’ t be fired . many would most likely be happy to take the golden handshake sommer will reportedly get .
a recent report in the newsmagazine der spiegel said telekom legally owes the 53-year-old a severance package of close to 15 million euro . the outgoing telekom chief reportedly took care of longtime confidant jürgen kindervater , the communications chief , as well , extending his contract by an additional five years just before his departure . the extension , reported in wednesday 's berliner zeituung means a big pay-off to kindervater should sihler decide to get rid of him before his contract runs out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

ron sommer -lrb- left -rrb- and his successor helmut sihler .
the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .
details of the plan have already been leaked out to the german newsmagazine focus . first on the chopping block , according to the report , is telekom ’ s 1.9 billion euro marketing and advertising budget .
sihler and co. have plans to trim the budget by 400 million euro down to 1.5 billion euro . shedding excess baggage the company then must decide what assets it can sell .
top of the list are telekom ’ s television cable network that denver-based liberty media wanted to buy for 5.5 billion euro a few months back .
germany ’ s anti-trust office blocked that deal and telekom will most likely get no more than 3 billion for the network now , according to analysts . then there ’ s voicestream .
last week , telekom re-launched the voicestream brand as t-mobile in nevada and california .
the acquisition of the sixth-largest us wireless company was part of sommer ’ s ambition to spread the telekom brand worldwide . now t-mobile could very well be on the way out .
voicestream has been losing money and customers at a steady clip .
after paying 33 billion euro for the company in june 2001 , analysts believe telekom can get , at best , 10 billion euro for it now . job losses a reality last , but not least , is telekom ’ s workforce . the german company employs 260,000 people worldwide .
focus said the board may trim the german workforce alone by 22,000 . but german law prevents sihler from cutting too much in this area .
at least 25 percent of the former state company are considered civil servants and therefore can ’ t be fired . many would most likely be happy to take the golden handshake sommer will reportedly get .
a recent report in the newsmagazine der spiegel said telekom legally owes the 53-year-old a severance package of close to 15 million euro . the outgoing telekom chief reportedly took care of longtime confidant jürgen kindervater , the communications chief , as well , extending his contract by an additional five years just before his departure . the extension , reported in wednesday 's berliner zeituung means a big pay-off to kindervater should sihler decide to get rid of him before his contract runs out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .

ron sommer -lrb- left -rrb- and his successor helmut sihler .
the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .
details of the plan have already been leaked out to the german newsmagazine focus . first on the chopping block , according to the report , is telekom ’ s 1.9 billion euro marketing and advertising budget .
sihler and co. have plans to trim the budget by 400 million euro down to 1.5 billion euro . shedding excess baggage the company then must decide what assets it can sell .
top of the list are telekom ’ s television cable network that denver-based liberty media wanted to buy for 5.5 billion euro a few months back .
germany ’ s anti-trust office blocked that deal and telekom will most likely get no more than 3 billion for the network now , according to analysts . then there ’ s voicestream .
last week , telekom re-launched the voicestream brand as t-mobile in nevada and california .
the acquisition of the sixth-largest us wireless company was part of sommer ’ s ambition to spread the telekom brand worldwide . now t-mobile could very well be on the way out .
voicestream has been losing money and customers at a steady clip .
after paying 33 billion euro for the company in june 2001 , analysts believe telekom can get , at best , 10 billion euro for it now . job losses a reality last , but not least , is telekom ’ s workforce . the german company employs 260,000 people worldwide .
focus said the board may trim the german workforce alone by 22,000 . but german law prevents sihler from cutting too much in this area .
at least 25 percent of the former state company are considered civil servants and therefore can ’ t be fired . many would most likely be happy to take the golden handshake sommer will reportedly get .
a recent report in the newsmagazine der spiegel said telekom legally owes the 53-year-old a severance package of close to 15 million euro . the outgoing telekom chief reportedly took care of longtime confidant jürgen kindervater , the communications chief , as well , extending his contract by an additional five years just before his departure . the extension , reported in wednesday 's berliner zeituung means a big pay-off to kindervater should sihler decide to get rid of him before his contract runs out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but they may soon be replaced by even gentler giants - kyoto protocol-friendly , emissions-free fuel cell buses that are powered by hydrogen and oxygen .
in a report in wednesday 's " berliner zeitung " newspaper , berlin 's public transportation body , bvg , confirmed that construction plans have been completed for the buses , with the first model scheduled to hit the streets sometime next year for testing .
burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .
the buses ' fuel cell technology will make them quieter and more environmentally sound .
their only emission will be steam .
but the city says it has even more urgent criteria than the environment .
" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .
the buses will also help cut pollution by increasing the number of passengers they can carry .
currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .
the fuel cells are being built by proton motor , a starnberg-based company that specializes in building fuel cells for use in public transportation .
similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .

but they may soon be replaced by even gentler giants - kyoto protocol-friendly , emissions-free fuel cell buses that are powered by hydrogen and oxygen .
in a report in wednesday 's " berliner zeitung " newspaper , berlin 's public transportation body , bvg , confirmed that construction plans have been completed for the buses , with the first model scheduled to hit the streets sometime next year for testing .
burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .
the buses ' fuel cell technology will make them quieter and more environmentally sound .
their only emission will be steam .
but the city says it has even more urgent criteria than the environment .
" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .
the buses will also help cut pollution by increasing the number of passengers they can carry .
currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .
the fuel cells are being built by proton motor , a starnberg-based company that specializes in building fuel cells for use in public transportation .
similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .
if the prototype fuel cell double deckers are a success , " big yellow , " could be around for generations to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .
today , there are said to be 2,000 animals living in the area , and the number is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .
today , there are said to be 2,000 animals living in the area , and the number is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but they may soon be replaced by even gentler giants - kyoto protocol-friendly , emissions-free fuel cell buses that are powered by hydrogen and oxygen .
in a report in wednesday 's " berliner zeitung " newspaper , berlin 's public transportation body , bvg , confirmed that construction plans have been completed for the buses , with the first model scheduled to hit the streets sometime next year for testing .
burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .
the buses ' fuel cell technology will make them quieter and more environmentally sound .
their only emission will be steam .
but the city says it has even more urgent criteria than the environment .
" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .
the buses will also help cut pollution by increasing the number of passengers they can carry .
currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .
the fuel cells are being built by proton motor , a starnberg-based company that specializes in building fuel cells for use in public transportation .
similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .

but they may soon be replaced by even gentler giants - kyoto protocol-friendly , emissions-free fuel cell buses that are powered by hydrogen and oxygen .
in a report in wednesday 's " berliner zeitung " newspaper , berlin 's public transportation body , bvg , confirmed that construction plans have been completed for the buses , with the first model scheduled to hit the streets sometime next year for testing .
burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .
the buses ' fuel cell technology will make them quieter and more environmentally sound .
their only emission will be steam .
but the city says it has even more urgent criteria than the environment .
" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .
the buses will also help cut pollution by increasing the number of passengers they can carry .
currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .
the fuel cells are being built by proton motor , a starnberg-based company that specializes in building fuel cells for use in public transportation .
similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .

but they may soon be replaced by even gentler giants - kyoto protocol-friendly , emissions-free fuel cell buses that are powered by hydrogen and oxygen .
in a report in wednesday 's " berliner zeitung " newspaper , berlin 's public transportation body , bvg , confirmed that construction plans have been completed for the buses , with the first model scheduled to hit the streets sometime next year for testing .
burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .
the buses ' fuel cell technology will make them quieter and more environmentally sound .
their only emission will be steam .
but the city says it has even more urgent criteria than the environment .
" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .
the buses will also help cut pollution by increasing the number of passengers they can carry .
currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .
the fuel cells are being built by proton motor , a starnberg-based company that specializes in building fuel cells for use in public transportation .
similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .

burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .
the buses ' fuel cell technology will make them quieter and more environmentally sound .
their only emission will be steam .
but the city says it has even more urgent criteria than the environment .
" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .
the buses will also help cut pollution by increasing the number of passengers they can carry .
currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .
the fuel cells are being built by proton motor , a starnberg-based company that specializes in building fuel cells for use in public transportation .
similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .
if the prototype fuel cell double deckers are a success , " big yellow , " could be around for generations to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but they may soon be replaced by even gentler giants - kyoto protocol-friendly , emissions-free fuel cell buses that are powered by hydrogen and oxygen .
in a report in wednesday 's " berliner zeitung " newspaper , berlin 's public transportation body , bvg , confirmed that construction plans have been completed for the buses , with the first model scheduled to hit the streets sometime next year for testing .
burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .
the buses ' fuel cell technology will make them quieter and more environmentally sound .
their only emission will be steam .
but the city says it has even more urgent criteria than the environment .
" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .
the buses will also help cut pollution by increasing the number of passengers they can carry .
currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .
the fuel cells are being built by proton motor , a starnberg-based company that specializes in building fuel cells for use in public transportation .
similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .

ron sommer -lrb- left -rrb- and his successor helmut sihler .
the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .
details of the plan have already been leaked out to the german newsmagazine focus . first on the chopping block , according to the report , is telekom ’ s 1.9 billion euro marketing and advertising budget .
sihler and co. have plans to trim the budget by 400 million euro down to 1.5 billion euro . shedding excess baggage the company then must decide what assets it can sell .
top of the list are telekom ’ s television cable network that denver-based liberty media wanted to buy for 5.5 billion euro a few months back .
germany ’ s anti-trust office blocked that deal and telekom will most likely get no more than 3 billion for the network now , according to analysts . then there ’ s voicestream .
last week , telekom re-launched the voicestream brand as t-mobile in nevada and california .
the acquisition of the sixth-largest us wireless company was part of sommer ’ s ambition to spread the telekom brand worldwide . now t-mobile could very well be on the way out .
voicestream has been losing money and customers at a steady clip .
after paying 33 billion euro for the company in june 2001 , analysts believe telekom can get , at best , 10 billion euro for it now . job losses a reality last , but not least , is telekom ’ s workforce . the german company employs 260,000 people worldwide .
focus said the board may trim the german workforce alone by 22,000 . but german law prevents sihler from cutting too much in this area .
at least 25 percent of the former state company are considered civil servants and therefore can ’ t be fired . many would most likely be happy to take the golden handshake sommer will reportedly get .
a recent report in the newsmagazine der spiegel said telekom legally owes the 53-year-old a severance package of close to 15 million euro . the outgoing telekom chief reportedly took care of longtime confidant jürgen kindervater , the communications chief , as well , extending his contract by an additional five years just before his departure . the extension , reported in wednesday 's berliner zeituung means a big pay-off to kindervater should sihler decide to get rid of him before his contract runs out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .
details of the plan have already been leaked out to the german newsmagazine focus . first on the chopping block , according to the report , is telekom ’ s 1.9 billion euro marketing and advertising budget .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .
today , there are said to be 2,000 animals living in the area , and the number is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but they may soon be replaced by even gentler giants - kyoto protocol-friendly , emissions-free fuel cell buses that are powered by hydrogen and oxygen .
in a report in wednesday 's " berliner zeitung " newspaper , berlin 's public transportation body , bvg , confirmed that construction plans have been completed for the buses , with the first model scheduled to hit the streets sometime next year for testing .
burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .
the buses ' fuel cell technology will make them quieter and more environmentally sound .
their only emission will be steam .
but the city says it has even more urgent criteria than the environment .
" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .
the buses will also help cut pollution by increasing the number of passengers they can carry .
currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .
the fuel cells are being built by proton motor , a starnberg-based company that specializes in building fuel cells for use in public transportation .
similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .

but they may soon be replaced by even gentler giants - kyoto protocol-friendly , emissions-free fuel cell buses that are powered by hydrogen and oxygen .
in a report in wednesday 's " berliner zeitung " newspaper , berlin 's public transportation body , bvg , confirmed that construction plans have been completed for the buses , with the first model scheduled to hit the streets sometime next year for testing .
burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .
the buses ' fuel cell technology will make them quieter and more environmentally sound .
their only emission will be steam .
but the city says it has even more urgent criteria than the environment .
" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .
the buses will also help cut pollution by increasing the number of passengers they can carry .
currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .
the fuel cells are being built by proton motor , a starnberg-based company that specializes in building fuel cells for use in public transportation .
similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .
if the prototype fuel cell double deckers are a success , " big yellow , " could be around for generations to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .
today , there are said to be 2,000 animals living in the area , and the number is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but they may soon be replaced by even gentler giants - kyoto protocol-friendly , emissions-free fuel cell buses that are powered by hydrogen and oxygen .
in a report in wednesday 's " berliner zeitung " newspaper , berlin 's public transportation body , bvg , confirmed that construction plans have been completed for the buses , with the first model scheduled to hit the streets sometime next year for testing .
burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .

" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .

currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .

a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.07.2002 saving deutsche telekom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " t " stands for trouble .
ron sommer -lrb- left -rrb- and his successor helmut sihler .
the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .
details of the plan have already been leaked out to the german newsmagazine focus . first on the chopping block , according to the report , is telekom ’ s 1.9 billion euro marketing and advertising budget .
sihler and co. have plans to trim the budget by 400 million euro down to 1.5 billion euro . shedding excess baggage the company then must decide what assets it can sell .
top of the list are telekom ’ s television cable network that denver-based liberty media wanted to buy for 5.5 billion euro a few months back .
germany ’ s anti-trust office blocked that deal and telekom will most likely get no more than 3 billion for the network now , according to analysts . then there ’ s voicestream .
last week , telekom re-launched the voicestream brand as t-mobile in nevada and california .
the acquisition of the sixth-largest us wireless company was part of sommer ’ s ambition to spread the telekom brand worldwide . now t-mobile could very well be on the way out .
voicestream has been losing money and customers at a steady clip .
after paying 33 billion euro for the company in june 2001 , analysts believe telekom can get , at best , 10 billion euro for it now . job losses a reality last , but not least , is telekom ’ s workforce . the german company employs 260,000 people worldwide .
focus said the board may trim the german workforce alone by 22,000 . but german law prevents sihler from cutting too much in this area .
at least 25 percent of the former state company are considered civil servants and therefore can ’ t be fired . many would most likely be happy to take the golden handshake sommer will reportedly get .
a recent report in the newsmagazine der spiegel said telekom legally owes the 53-year-old a severance package of close to 15 million euro . the outgoing telekom chief reportedly took care of longtime confidant jürgen kindervater , the communications chief , as well , extending his contract by an additional five years just before his departure . the extension , reported in wednesday 's berliner zeituung means a big pay-off to kindervater should sihler decide to get rid of him before his contract runs out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .
details of the plan have already been leaked out to the german newsmagazine focus . first on the chopping block , according to the report , is telekom ’ s 1.9 billion euro marketing and advertising budget .

last week , telekom re-launched the voicestream brand as t-mobile in nevada and california .
the acquisition of the sixth-largest us wireless company was part of sommer ’ s ambition to spread the telekom brand worldwide . now t-mobile could very well be on the way out .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .
today , there are said to be 2,000 animals living in the area , and the number is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .

ron sommer -lrb- left -rrb- and his successor helmut sihler .
the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .
details of the plan have already been leaked out to the german newsmagazine focus . first on the chopping block , according to the report , is telekom ’ s 1.9 billion euro marketing and advertising budget .
sihler and co. have plans to trim the budget by 400 million euro down to 1.5 billion euro . shedding excess baggage the company then must decide what assets it can sell .
top of the list are telekom ’ s television cable network that denver-based liberty media wanted to buy for 5.5 billion euro a few months back .

last week , telekom re-launched the voicestream brand as t-mobile in nevada and california .
the acquisition of the sixth-largest us wireless company was part of sommer ’ s ambition to spread the telekom brand worldwide . now t-mobile could very well be on the way out .
voicestream has been losing money and customers at a steady clip .
after paying 33 billion euro for the company in june 2001 , analysts believe telekom can get , at best , 10 billion euro for it now . job losses a reality last , but not least , is telekom ’ s workforce . the german company employs 260,000 people worldwide .
focus said the board may trim the german workforce alone by 22,000 . but german law prevents sihler from cutting too much in this area .

the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .
today , there are said to be 2,000 animals living in the area , and the number is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

ron sommer -lrb- left -rrb- and his successor helmut sihler .
the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .
details of the plan have already been leaked out to the german newsmagazine focus . first on the chopping block , according to the report , is telekom ’ s 1.9 billion euro marketing and advertising budget .
sihler and co. have plans to trim the budget by 400 million euro down to 1.5 billion euro . shedding excess baggage the company then must decide what assets it can sell .
top of the list are telekom ’ s television cable network that denver-based liberty media wanted to buy for 5.5 billion euro a few months back .

they hope to find ways to save this endangered species . " it may not be very pleasant work , but it is highly informative " , says frank hansen , nature reserve warden in the eastern state of mecklenberg pomerania .
hansen has been collecting otters ’ droppings now for several weeks .
together with an institute in berlin , he is on the lookout for some of germany ’ s last eurasian otters .
only a hundred years ago , the eurasian otter was a common creature in europe .
since the turn of the 20th century , the otter has become an increasingly rare sight and is now only occasionally found in countries across central europe .
in germany there are thought to be only several hundred left .
keeping track with over 100 different scent components , each containing specific information on age , sex and species , the most effective way for otters to communicate is through their droppings .
researchers at the institute for zoo and wildlife research in berlin , therefore , are hoping to track down some of the last of this endangered animal by extracting the otters ’ genetic fingerprints - from its droppings .
this in turn may help scientists recommend ways to save the species .
according to project leader beate kalz , the results have so far proved successful .
" we have identified 21 different animals from the first 28 samples " , she says .
" we hope to find out whether there are enough animals in the park , and whether enough animals survive to maintain the population . "
marine mammal the otter , which belongs to the family of badgers and weasels , spends most of its time in water - both fresh and seawater .
not only does it eat , sleep and hunt in water – it even gives birth in it .
in addition , otters are one of the few predators that hunt their prey under water .
but the increasing pollution of germany ’ s waters with pesticides and pcbs has had a severe impact on the otters ’ main source of food , fish , and the straightening of rivers has destroyed numerous examples of the otter 's natural habitats .
in addition , a dramatic increase in road traffic has contributed to the drastic reduction in otters .
in mecklenburg alone , around 100 otters were killed on the state ’ s busiest streets in the past years .
additional protection the institute hopes to determine the otters ’ various territories in mecklenburg with the help of their newest research technique .
by finding out just which otters cross which main roads , they hope to justify additional funds for otter protection – such as underground tunnel systems which would enable the animals to cross them without being run over .
" through these studies , we want to assess the extent to which the otters are threatened by traffic .
after all , protection projects like building road underpasses for instance , or wide bridges have to be financed , and are very expensive .
so we need hard data to show what role road kills have on the otters , " kalz says .
inspiration from abroad the berlin institute may look beyond borders for inspiration and hope for germany ’ s otter population : in california , the otter population was almost wiped out due to a blooming otter fur trade in the 18th and 19th century .
by the early 1900s , the californian sea otter was believed to be extinct , until 1938 , when a last remaining population was discovered living off the californian big sur coast .
since then , with the help of various environmental groups and otter protection measures , the population has gradually expanded .

the new chairman of germany 's telecom giant has an ambitious plan to drastically cut the company 's debt by next year .
among the losers will be the company 's marketing budget and its employees . after ridding itself of dynamic , but acquisition-happy chairman ron sommer last week , deutsche telekom is girding itself for a six-month savings course that aims to cut the company ’ s 65 billion euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- debt to 50 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- . newly-appointed chairman helmut sihler is reportedly confident he can pull off cuts at the beleagured german telecom giant .
deutsche telekom , like many of its counterparts in the telecom industry , has fallen on hard times after overestimating the growth of the internet . telekom spent billions on telephone licenses and expensive acquisitions , including the 33 billion euro purchase of american mobile phone company voicestream at the height of the telecom boom . now it falls to sihler , who helped transform a german laundry detergent company into international chemical concern henkel kgaa , to set the ship right .
details of the plan have already been leaked out to the german newsmagazine focus . first on the chopping block , according to the report , is telekom ’ s 1.9 billion euro marketing and advertising budget .
sihler and co. have plans to trim the budget by 400 million euro down to 1.5 billion euro . shedding excess baggage the company then must decide what assets it can sell .
top of the list are telekom ’ s television cable network that denver-based liberty media wanted to buy for 5.5 billion euro a few months back .
germany ’ s anti-trust office blocked that deal and telekom will most likely get no more than 3 billion for the network now , according to analysts . then there ’ s voicestream .
last week , telekom re-launched the voicestream brand as t-mobile in nevada and california .
the acquisition of the sixth-largest us wireless company was part of sommer ’ s ambition to spread the telekom brand worldwide . now t-mobile could very well be on the way out .
voicestream has been losing money and customers at a steady clip .
after paying 33 billion euro for the company in june 2001 , analysts believe telekom can get , at best , 10 billion euro for it now . job losses a reality last , but not least , is telekom ’ s workforce . the german company employs 260,000 people worldwide .
focus said the board may trim the german workforce alone by 22,000 . but german law prevents sihler from cutting too much in this area .
at least 25 percent of the former state company are considered civil servants and therefore can ’ t be fired . many would most likely be happy to take the golden handshake sommer will reportedly get .
a recent report in the newsmagazine der spiegel said telekom legally owes the 53-year-old a severance package of close to 15 million euro . the outgoing telekom chief reportedly took care of longtime confidant jürgen kindervater , the communications chief , as well , extending his contract by an additional five years just before his departure . the extension , reported in wednesday 's berliner zeituung means a big pay-off to kindervater should sihler decide to get rid of him before his contract runs out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but they may soon be replaced by even gentler giants - kyoto protocol-friendly , emissions-free fuel cell buses that are powered by hydrogen and oxygen .
in a report in wednesday 's " berliner zeitung " newspaper , berlin 's public transportation body , bvg , confirmed that construction plans have been completed for the buses , with the first model scheduled to hit the streets sometime next year for testing .
burkhard eberwein , bvg 's bus technology manager , told the paper that two prototypes of the volvo fuel cell bus would likely be put into service on the " 100 " and " 200 " lines , which pass by the city 's most popular attractions – from potsdamer platz to the reichstag and brandenburg gate – and are enormously popular with tourists .
the buses ' fuel cell technology will make them quieter and more environmentally sound .
their only emission will be steam .
but the city says it has even more urgent criteria than the environment .
" oil supplies are limited , and we 're thinking about how our buses will be powered in the future , " eberwein told the paper .
the buses will also help cut pollution by increasing the number of passengers they can carry .
currently , berlin buses can only hold an average of 95 passengers , but the new buses will be able to pack in 120 to 130 .
in order to accommodate the load , the buses ' size will be 1.8 meters -lrb- 4.92 feet -rrb- longer than the current 13.5 meter-long -lrb- 44.29 feet-long -rrb- double-deckers in the city 's fleet .
the fuel cells are being built by proton motor , a starnberg-based company that specializes in building fuel cells for use in public transportation .
similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .

similar hydrogen buses have been operating in the german cities erlangen and munich since 1996 .
a previous effort in berlin to introduce a fuel cell bus faltered due to problems with the italian technology used in a prototype bus manufactured by transportation giant man .
eberwein told the paper the fuel cells were unable to provide energy at a steady rate .
the test bus was supposed to be used in service between downtown berlin and tegel airport starting in 2001 , but has not yet been rolled out .
but bvg has great hopes for the proton motor and volvo project .
it 's been years since the city placed orders for new double-decker buses , and the number plying the streets has sunk from 1,000 buses to 450 since 1992 .
if the prototype fuel cell double deckers are a success , " big yellow , " could be around for generations to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the common 's health committee has criticised " very wide " variations in the number of people stuck in hospital beds .
figures from the department of health suggest that at the end of april , 6 % of all acute beds in english hospitals were taken up by people who could have been discharged . "
we need to get away from the idea that a hospital is the only place where a sick or recuperating person can be treated or stay " david hinchliffe in some areas the figure is as high as 20 % and mps suggested the total cost to the nhs was £ 720m each year .
in a report , published on wednesday , it urged the nhs , social services and local councils to work more closely together to tackle the problem .
many patients stuck unnecessarily in hospital are elderly , who are well enough to be discharged but are waiting for alternative care .
' patients at risk ' mps warned that keeping patients in hospital unnecessarily could be putting them at risk .
in their report , they said : " we are firmly convinced that hospitals are often inappropriate , potentially harmful , as well as exceedingly expensive places to act simply as staging posts for people awaiting care home places . "
they called on the department of health to publish guidelines to help hospitals reduce their number of inappropriate admissions .
the influential committee suggested that hospitals could also take firmer action by allowing nurses to discharge patients and employing patient discharge liaison managers to oversee the whole process .
they said : " arrangements for the management of discharge need radical overhaul in many hospitals .
" in our view , best practice involves a multi-agency team actively managing all aspects of the discharge process . "
the committee criticised ministers for failing to develop new ways of tackling the problem .
they suggested that using technology like telemedicine , which allows doctors and patients to retain contact through television , would allow many patients to be discharged .
warning on fines the committee warned the government against pressing ahead too quickly with plans to fine local councils that fail to provide alternative accommodation for patients who are stuck unnecessarily in hospital . "
milburn must rethink his plan to impose penalties on councils for delayed discharge " paul burstow , lib dem spokesman " there are real risks that perverse incentives will be created that will undermine partnerships that have taken time to develop and foster an unproductive culture of buck-passing and mutual blame between health and social care , " the report said .
committee chairman david hinchliffe said more work was needed to allow people to return home .
he said : " we need to get away from the idea that a hospital is the only place where a sick or recuperating person can be treated or stay . "
the department of health said action will be taken to tackle the issue .
a spokeswoman said : " we intend to legislate to introduce incentives for social services to provide services in a timely way , which avoids delays when the patient is ready to leave hospital . "
the conservatives said they hoped the report would force to government to act .
simon burns , its shadow health minister and a member of the health committee , said : " i hope that this report will focus the mind of the government , bring them out of their denial of the problems and act to do something to protect some of the most vulnerable people in our society . "
paul burstow of the liberal democrats added : " milburn must rethink his plan to impose penalties on councils for delayed discharge .
rather than delivering better care it will reinforce the culture of buck-passing and mutual blame . "
dr andrew dearden of the british medical association said : " people need to be discharged in a timely and organised way so they get the right care in the right place at the right time .
" there should be a plan in place for each patient so that as well as a treatment plan there is a discharge plan . "
on tuesday , the government announced that elderly people are to be given hundreds of pounds each to enable them to leave hospital and to buy home help services .

130,000 people have strokes every year and their chances of recovery depend on being treated in specialist units the report says that while there has been a slight improvement over the past four years many hospitals will not meet the government 's target for better treatment .
the college reckons that on current figures , it will be 73 years before all stroke patients spend half their time in hospital in specialist units .
click here to watch our interview with margaret goose .
breakfast talked to margaret goose , the chief executive of the stroke association .
she said : " we are urging all medical staff in casualty to be better trained in this area . "
three quarters of stroke patients admitted into hospital are not receiving special care .
they need to be in a specialist stoke unit where they are getting the right aftercare .
every five seconds someone somewhere is having a stroke .
every 1 in 10 stokes is being experienced by the under 25s , and it is the biggest killer , and the biggest cause of disability .
we want better care and more stroke units .
we are urging for all staff to be specifically trained especially in casualty and a & e where misdiagnoses have been known to take place .
click here to watch our interview with ron carter breakfast spoke to ron carter , a stroke patient .
he said : " it 's very frightening . "
i was watching tv stood up and fell flat on my face , my wife took me to the doctors and i was told not to worry , but things got progressively worse and my left side became totally paralysed , my leg felt like a lump of lead and i could n't do anything .
i knew there were warning signs of a stroke but doctors need to be trained to recognise them .
i 've now got back 65 % use of my left arm but it is very frightening stroke is one of the uk 's biggest killers and the single main cause of severe disability .
each year 130,000 people have a stroke .
the survey found that lack of resources were to blame for problems with facilities , diagnosis , treatment and care .
people are dying unnecessarily and living with long-term disability dr tony rudd it also found 27 % of stroke patients spent most of their stay in a stroke unit compared to 25 % in 1999 - that is an increase of 1 % per year .
if that continues , it will be 73 years before all patients with a stroke spend half their hospital time in a dedicated stroke unit .
the survey also showed that only 36 % of stroke patients spent any time at all in a stroke unit despite evidence that patients fare better in specialist facilities .
physical assessments only 64 % of patients were recorded as having a swallowing assessment , only 63 % a visual fields assessment , and only 49 % being weighed .
without this information , the patient is unlikely to be offered appropriate therapy , such as speech or language therapy or physiotherapy .
this may lead to future problems in regaining the use of their limbs , sight , hearing and ability to eat properly .
other findings include : the number of hospitals who treat stroke patients in a stroke unit has increased from 45 % in 1998 and 56 % in 1999 to 73 % in 2001/2 , but the number of allocated beds remains inadequate and can not meet the demand nearly one in five patients are not getting a brain scan one in ten patients who should be prescribed aspirin or similar drugs following their stay in hospital is not receiving them the number of trusts who have a consultant with responsibility for stroke has gone up to 80 % , but the majority of doctors doing this only spend about eight hours of their week in this role .
the british association of stroke physicians estimates an average district should have two full-time stroke physicians .
dr tony rudd , a stroke specialist at guy 's and st thomas ' hospital in london , said evidence suggested that 19 % fewer people would die and 29 % fewer would end up dead or disabled if they were treated in a specialist stroke unit .
that amounted to about 18,000 more people dying , or a total of 27,000 left dead or disabled , every year in the uk .
he said : " people are dying unnecessarily and living with long-term disability , some of which could have been avoided , because of the failure to deliver specialist stroke care .
stroke care is moving forward but at a snail 's pace margaret goose " co-ordinated care saves lives and reduces disability .
" although we are seeing improvements in stroke care , we are not going to achieve the ideal until stroke care is given a higher priority .
we need more resources , staff , money and support to deliver effective stroke care . "
more needed margaret goose , chief executive of the stroke association , said she was " really disappointed " that nearly three quarters of stroke patients were not getting care in specialist stroke units .
she said : " stroke care is moving forward but at a snail 's pace .
" and while the improvement in care edges forward people are dying when they should not be or suffering from disability when they could be living independent lives . "
the government 's national service framework for older people stated that everyone who had a stroke should receive specialist care by 2004 .
the audit covered england , wales and northern ireland .

former culture spokesman tim yeo moves to trade and industry while former trade spokesman john whittingdale gets mr yeo 's old job .
at a press conference , mrs may , 45 , said : " i believe the conservative party has changed and my appointment as the first woman chairman symbolises that change .
" now my job is to take that message out across the country at large under our campaign to help the vulnerable .
" the conservative party is an open , decent and tolerant party .
we are committed to reform of public services ...
" our job is to oppose a government that is taking more and more of people 's money , but is delivering poor public services .
we can show that there is a better way for britain . "
' very happy ' mr duncan smith said he and mr davis had " spoken at length " about the former chairman 's new role .
" david has been very happy to take the job i offered him which was shadowing the office of the deputy prime minister . "
davis : accused of blocking modernisation the tory leader insisted : " that is a big job because it brings in a lot of the cabinet office areas as well as local government areas and the regions . "
mr davis would be working with tory shadow transport minister eric pickles as the government beefs up its regional government agenda , he said .
asked if mr davis had been an unsuccessful chairman , mr duncan smith retorted : " we now need to change the emphasis . "
he added : " it 's my duty as leader - i 'm in charge , i must make these decisions about who i think are the round pegs in the round holes . "
' meteoric rise ' mr duncan smith said mrs may was the " best " person to coordinate and focus the party .
mrs may has had a " meteoric " rise through the party 's ranks since becoming mp for maidenhead in 1997 .
mr duncan smith was particularly impressed by her persistent calls for stephen byers to quit as transport secretary during the spin debacle , party officials said .
mr duncan smith refused to speculate on the reshuffle mrs may is said to personify the changes mr duncan smith intends to make to the party , with greater inclusiveness and accessibility to ethnic minorities and women high on the agenda .
reports claim the reshuffle follows divisions between the tory leader and mr davis , who some colleagues have accused of blocking efforts to modernise the party .
' no rift ' but deputy tory leader michael ancram told bbc radio 4 's world at one programme : " in the run up to reshuffles there are alwys leaks and stories in newspapers .
he denied that mr davis had " committed a crime " .
" shadowing the deputy prime minister is hardly a demotion - it 's a very important job and i am sure he will do it very well . "
mr davis has surprised some at westminster by taking a summer holiday in florida while the house of commons is still sitting .
some newspaper reports quoted unnamed tory sources as saying mr davis had lost favour because he had failed to drive through reforms to ensure the party had greater numbers of women and ethnic minority candidates .
it was also suggested that mr davis was keeping his distance from mr duncan smith 's team as he prepared to run for the leadership again .
lib dem parliamentary party chairman mark oaten mp said : " this reshuffle is a sign of a leader desperate to cover up his own inadequacies by scapegoating the party chairman .
" what will mr duncan smith do if the tories are still on 30 % in the polls a year from now ? "
labour party chairman charles clarke said : " i think it 's the first time in recent recorded political history that the leading conspirator has been promoted to prosecute his conspiracy more energetically . "
" i think it 's a very surprising move .

" the conservative party is an open , decent and tolerant party .
we are committed to reform of public services ...
" our job is to oppose a government that is taking more and more of people 's money , but is delivering poor public services .
we can show that there is a better way for britain . "
' very happy ' mr duncan smith said he and mr davis had " spoken at length " about the former chairman 's new role .
" david has been very happy to take the job i offered him which was shadowing the office of the deputy prime minister . "
the tory leader insisted : " that is a big job because it brings in a lot of the cabinet office areas as well as local government areas and the regions . "
mr davis would be working with tory shadow transport minister eric pickles as the government beefs up its regional government agenda , he said .
asked if mr davis had been an unsuccessful chairman , mr duncan smith retorted : " we now need to change the emphasis . "
he added : " it 's my duty as leader - i 'm in charge , i must make these decisions about who i think are the round pegs in the round holes . "
' meteoric rise ' mr duncan smith said mrs may was the " best " person to coordinate and focus the party .
mrs may has had a " meteoric " rise through the party 's ranks since becoming mp for maidenhead in 1997 .
mr duncan smith was particularly impressed by her persistent calls for stephen byers to quit as transport secretary during the spin debacle , party officials said .
mrs may is said to personify the changes mr duncan smith intends to make to the party , with greater inclusiveness and accessibility to ethnic minorities and women high on the agenda .
reports claim the reshuffle follows divisions between the tory leader and mr davis , who some colleagues have accused of blocking efforts to modernise the party .
' no rift ' but deputy tory leader michael ancram told bbc radio 4 's world at one programme : " in the run up to reshuffles there are alwys leaks and stories in newspapers .
he denied that mr davis had " committed a crime " .
" shadowing the deputy prime minister is hardly a demotion - it 's a very important job and i am sure he will do it very well . "
mr davis has surprised some at westminster by taking a summer holiday in florida while the house of commons is still sitting .
some newspaper reports quoted unnamed tory sources as saying mr davis had lost favour because he had failed to drive through reforms to ensure the party had greater numbers of women and ethnic minority candidates .
it was also suggested that mr davis was keeping his distance from mr duncan smith 's team as he prepared to run for the leadership again .
lib dem parliamentary party chairman mark oaten mp said : " this reshuffle is a sign of a leader desperate to cover up his own inadequacies by scapegoating the party chairman .
" what will mr duncan smith do if the tories are still on 30 % in the polls a year from now ? "
labour party chairman charles clarke said : " i think it 's the first time in recent recorded political history that the leading conspirator has been promoted to prosecute his conspiracy more energetically . "
" i think it 's a very surprising move . "

tony carroll says beswick is becoming a " goldmine " the price tag is still less than a third of the average for manchester as a whole , according to the figures from new east manchester , indicating how depressed the area has been in the recent past .

for the first time in six months , june 's figures showed japan exported less - 3.9 % less - than the month before .
while the figures still showed an 8.9 % gain on the same month last year , the fear is that the steadily weakening dollar - not to mention the relentless slide of world stock markets and the near-panic about corporate governance in some quarters of the us - are combining to torpedo the turnaround from ten years of decline .
a slide in imports of 5.1 % year on year is compounding the concern , because it indicates that japanese consumers are still nowhere near ready to take up the slack if the rest of the world falters .
out of balance japan 's trade surplus - the excess it exports over what it imports - has historically been huge compared to the rest of the world .
the country 's breakneck growth from the second world war till the end of the 1980s was fed by exports , first of steel and other hardware and later by consumer electronics , cars and computers .
and even now on a year-by year basis the trend is for increasing surplus , thanks to last year 's dismal showing , with june 's figure of 1.3 trillion yen -lrb- $ 11.1bn ; £ 7.1bn -rrb- marking a 71.6 % rise over the same month in 2001 .
but the surge in the yen from below 130 to the dollar to around 115 in the past couple of months is making exports more expensive to overseas customers .
although the effects so far are marginal , observers say the impact is likely to be felt later in the year , when japan 's current growth - an impressive 5.7 % if the january-march performance were continued for 12 months - will probably evaporate .
" " we 're probably not going to get any of the bad effects from either the strengthening of the yen or the potential slowdown in overseas growth until the second half of the year , " said lehman brothers japan 's matthew poggi .
but he added : " we have trade turning from a positive contributor to growth to a neutral contributor in the fourth quarter . "
bank jitters bank of japan governor masaru hayami echoed the concerns in a quarterly meeting of the bank 's regional managers .
while the economy was close to turning the corner , he said , it remained highly vulnerable to the big picture worldwide .
and he reiterated that without reforming the banking system , still overburdened with bad debts built up in the go-go-1980s , a long-lasting recovery was unlikely .

but the journey is still far from smooth .
pendolino - in italian roughly translated as " she that leans " - is sadly and quite literally " she that wo n't be leaning any time soon " here in the uk , thanks to railtrack .
the train made its maiden journey on tuesday the inability of the now-defunct rail infrastructure company to upgrade the track means that sir richard branson 's shiny 140mph toy wo n't be breaking any speed records on its first public run .
ever the optimist , sir richard told bbc news online that he was " reasonably confident " that railtrack 's successor , network rail , would have his fleet of pendolinos leaning eventually .
" the problems with railtrack we could have done without , but we 're looking forward not back . "
out of place unfortunately it 's not just the track that conspired against the launch on tuesday .
the pendolino would no doubt look more breathtaking under an azure italian sky than pulling into birmingham international in drizzle .
in a year people will say the best thing virgin did was sort out britain 's trains sir richard branson not even the waiting trainspotters seemed too impressed by the arrival of the £ 1m electric locomotive .
" i 'm sure it 's very nice inside , " says les ross , opening his notebook .
" but then i prefer trains with engines , i 'm old fashioned . "
mr ross must surely adore virgin 's normal rolling stock , some of which dates back decades .
this pendolino , the first of 53 ordered by virgin , is part of the embattled company 's bid to put things back on the right track .
sir richard : " i do n't regret getting into trains " sir richard , whose other business ventures have generally won public approval , has seen his brand somewhat tarnished by the poor performance of virgin trains .
" i do n't regret getting into trains , although some mornings i wake up thinking ' what the hell have i done ' , " says sir richard .
his entry into the sector was motivated by the belief that : " we could transform the absolute mess the railways were in after 30 years of underinvestment , " he says .
" a year from now , i predict people will be saying that the best thing virgin did was sort out britain 's trains . "
creature comforts fittingly as the pendolino leaves birmingham , a steel band launches into abba 's i have a dream .
sir richard 's pendolino dream , presently bereft of both lean and speed , is for now pinned on comfort .
en route to manchester on launch day " these trains are so special that it 's like the difference between propeller aircraft and passenger jets , " sir richard says .
indeed , inside the pendolino even ordinary seats are as comfortable as a plane 's business class cabin .
there are laptop and mobile phone sockets , and this being a branson outfit , there is even an eclectic 14-channnel music service .
the plane comparison begins to fail as the carriages start to shimmy like a tiny cessna flying through a typhoon en route to manchester .
while much of the rattle and shake may be the fault of the track , the pendolino 's vicious automatic doors contribute to sending more than one attendant sprawling , celebratory champagne glasses christening both the upholstery and the vips .
as the journey progresses and the train 's speed creaks up to 110mph , offers of coffee are declined - perhaps for fear of scalding .
the address system is also familiarly patchy and despite the handy recharging sockets , mobile connection is as problematic as on a normal train .
