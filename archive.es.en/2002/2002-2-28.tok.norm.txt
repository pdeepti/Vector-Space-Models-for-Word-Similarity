political coverage is seen as white , middle-class , middle-aged men arguing with other white , middle-class , middle-aged men in a " secret shared language " , according to research published on thursday . "
it is incumbent on the bbc ... to take a leading role in trying to increase people 's engagement in the political process " richard sambrook director of bbc news rock star bob geldof is closer to many people 's idea of a political hero than most politicians , although some identify with former tory minister ann widdecombe and former labour minister mo mowlam .
to counter this lack of interest , the bbc has set up teams to develop new ideas in specific areas to boost its political coverage and encourage viewing by a younger audience .
richard sambrook , director of bbc news , said : " politicians and the media have known for some time that there 's a lack of involvement and engagement in politics .
lack of interest " the research we publish today illustrates just how serious that problem is .
" it is incumbent on the bbc , as a public service broadcaster to take a leading role in trying to increase people 's engagement in the political process and democratic debate . "
figures show news viewing has been declining since 1993 , with the numbers of viewers under the age of 44 dropping by a quarter .
many young people do not watch or listen to any political coverage at all .
" the research shows that people are not beginning to get interested when they reach their 30s and 40s , " said mr sambrook .
" this demographic wave of disengagement could soon mean political coverage is largely watched by those in their 50s and older . "
many people questioned in the research , conducted by agency trbi , found politics difficult to relate to their everyday lives and felt that elections were a poor , archaic way of expressing choices or opinions .
nearly 40 % of respondents said politicians were " crooks " , " out for themselves " , " liars " , " did n't care about ordinary people " and " a waste of time " .
' too elitist ' some 37 % felt they were " powerless " , " unsupported " and " unrepresented " .
they also believed the media 's coverage of politics was " too elitist " and humour or drama should be used to explore the world of politicians and politics .
they also felt that the media focused too much on scandal and trivia around politicians rather than issues .
the bbc new politics initiative , led by sian kevill , will use the research in a bid to bring new programme ideas on to tv screens by the end of the year .
teams developing new ideas for bbc political coverage will focus on uniting different parts of the bbc to tackle politics , appealing to the under-45s and using drama and online services .
" we want to refresh political coverage with innovative and creative new thinking , " said ms kevill .
the bbc is the uk 's largest broadcaster of political news and current affairs across television .

the scheme , which is the first of its kind in scotland , is designed to combat the high levels of re-offending found among many prisoners on their release .
if the scheme proves successful it could be extended to other jails across the country .
at present , inmates at some scottish jails can learn to use specialised machinery , giving them a useful skill for life beyond the prison walls .
but jobs are often in short supply for ex-cons , partly because companies do not want to employ newly released prisoners .
this pilot project is designed to work around that problem , by helping offenders develop the skills they need to set up and run their own business .
the scheme is being run with the help of scottish enterprise , which will continue to advise prisoners when they are eventually released or transferred to an open prison .

pierre boulez has grown to become one of the world 's most respected composers and one of france 's most celebrated conductors .

studio his career as a conductor began to flourish in the 1950s , during which time he performed with the südwestfunk -lrb- south-west german radio -rrb- .
he also began acting as guest conductor for some of europe 's leading orchestras and festivals .

bbc news online looks at the story of its success .
up against such big names as u2 and bob dylan , few people gave a bunch of little-known country musicians much chance of walking away with one of the most prestigious awards at the grammys .
but that was what happened when the music from the film o brother , where art thou ? became the first soundtrack to win the album of the year prize since 1994 .
the characters became singing stars in the film grammys host jon stewart told everybody to go out and buy it - but many will not need to as it has sold more than four million copies and has been one of the most unexpected hits of recent years .
variously described as bluegrass , roots , mountain music and old-time country , it contains rustic sounds of harmonies , gospel choirs , mandolins , guitars , violins and banjos .
first popular in the 1920s and 1930s , the styles owe their comeback to the comedy film by joel and ethan coen , which is based on homer 's odyssey and stars george clooney .

the coen brothers enlisted veteran musician and producer t-bone burnett , who had helped put together the music for their last film , the big lebowski .
" being so heavily involved in roots music , we called him before we 'd even finished the script , " ethan coen said .
burnett preferred to be known as the " music archivist " , but " music supervisor " would have been more accurate as he went about finding the songs for the film with singer-songwriter gillian welch .
one of the inspired choices was to revive a tune called i am a man of constant sorrow , a folk song from the appalachian mountains first recorded in 1922 .
anthem the real soggy bottom boys performed at the grammys in the film , it became the anthem that made clooney 's band , the soggy bottom boys , depression-era stars .
in real life , it was recorded by dan tyminski , harley allen and pat enright and became the anthem that made the soundtrack a hit .
mr tyminski provided the singing voice for clooney on the film , and had to warn his wife , elise , the first time they watched it that when clooney would sing , she would really hear her husband 's voice .
" your voice coming out of george clooney 's body ?
dan , that 's my fantasy ! " she replied .
other musicians to feature on the cd included emmylou harris , alison krauss , the whites , the cox family , john hartford , and 75-year-old ralph stanley .
spin-offs while the film was an arthouse hit , nobody expected its music to go on to have so much success that it has taken on a life of its own .
first there was an o brother concert in nashville , then a documentary that had its own soundtrack , a united states tour and an o sister album .

royal bank of scotland has unveiled higher profits and said its merger with nat west is proceeding more smoothly than expected .
the bank said on thursday that pre-tax profits for 2001 came in at £ 4.3bn -lrb- $ 6bn -rrb- , up by nearly a third from £ 3.3bn the year before .
the profits figure for 2000 has been adjusted to take account of the merger that year between royal bank of scotland and natwest .
the company said all its divisions managed to boost sales , with total income for 2001 rising 18 % on the year to £ 14.5bn , and added that it is well-placed to continue growing .
" i am confident that the ... strength , diversity and flexibility of the group will enable us to continue to build value , " said rbs chairman sir george mathewson .
merger costs and benefits rbs , the uk 's second biggest bank , added that it now expects its merger with natwest to yield £ 5.5bn in profits by the end of 2003 , up from its previous estimate of about £ 4.1bn.

bad debt woes however , the global economic downturn forced the company to set aside an extra £ 230m to take account of bad debts , bringing the total to just over £ 1bn .
rbs blamed " a deterioration in the short-term economic outlook combined with the impact of a small number of specific customer situations . "
in the city , rbs shares were marked 26p lower at 1,708p in early trade on wednesday .
the bank had carried out 17,000 of a planned 18,000 job cuts stemming from the nat west merger by december 2001 .
but rbs 's total employee headcount rose by more than 11,000 to 105,700 during the year .

survey economists have warned that mr sinha will need to come up with strong policies to give the economy the boost it badly needs .
on tuesday , the government 's annual economic survey said that further economic liberalisation was needed to boost growth and reduce poverty .
the survey , which is seen as a preview to the budget , highlighted the difficulties for india 's bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- which heads the coalition government , to lift rapid growth before elections in 2004 .
after rapid growth in the early 1990s , the indian economy slowed down as its gdp dropped from 7 % to 4 % in the fiscal year to march 2001 . "
the economy has slowed down quite substantially " mahesh vyas , centre for monitoring the indian economy " the restoration of high economic growth would be difficult to achieve without a significant and sustained reduction in the fiscal deficit , " the economic survey said .
state elections last week brought surprise setbacks for the bjp .
the party lost three states , including the key one of uttar pradesh .
correspondents say the outcome could make it harder for the bjp to push through reforms , such as privatisation and relaxation of rigid labour laws .
kickstart without the reforms , the high deficit could become chronic .
higher interest rates , agricultural subsidies and pension payments in recent years had driven it up to unsustainable levels , limiting investment in infrastructure and social sectors .
" the economy has slowed down quite substantially , " mahesh vyas from the centre for monitoring the indian economy told the bbc 's world business report .
" the substantial slowdown in the agricultural sector , and a resulting slowdown in domestic consumption , has had an impact on investment , bringing down the growth rate and affected employment opportunities as well , " he said .
growth target missed the fiscal deficit for the year ending in march is expected to shrink to 5.1 % of gdp , from 5.5 % the previous year , as slower growth cut expected tax revenues .
the deficit target for the current year was for 4.7 % of gdp .
the report said growth would be 5.4 % in the year to march , up from 4 % in the previous year but well short of the 8 % the government says is needed to reduce poverty .
faisa feroz , managing director of sales at pramad securities in delhi told the bbc 's world business report that this is a respectable growth rate but she believes it falls short of india 's potential .
" you could hit 5 % in india just on normal demand growth , " she said .
a turnaround in the recession-bound manufacturing sector has not occurred , but higher rural incomes from a bumper harvest could push up demand for industrial goods and revive industry .
