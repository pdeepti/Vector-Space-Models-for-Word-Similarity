program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 24.09.2002 germany 's former communists out in the cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crushed - pds chairwoman gabriele zimmer during early poll results on sunday germany ’ s party of democratic socialism suffered a stinging defeat in the recent elections as it failed to re-enter parliament .
the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .
but in the following years , many of its ideals lived on in german politics , embodied by the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
sunday 's parliamentary elections , however , sounded the final death knell for communism on the national level as it sent the successor to east germany 's communists packing from the parliament .
in a disastrous showing , the pds won neither 5 percent of the national vote nor gained the largest number of votes in three constituencies - the two criteria needed to enter parliament .
the stunning defeat was a bitter pill to swallow .
" there is a need for socialist politics , but it appears we have not been able to get this across sufficiently , " said a visibly resigned gabi zimmer , the party ’ s chairwoman .
worst defeat in party history the defeat is indeed the worst in the party ’ s 12-year history .
it marks the first time since its formation shortly after the fall of the berlin wall that the pds has been denied a place on the national political stage .
in the wake of this election , the pds had been relegated to the status of a local and regional party in eastern germany .
in 1998 , the pds overcame the 5 percent barrier needed for representation and entered the bundestag polling a record 21.6 percent of the votes in the east .
this time , the pds received only 4 percent of the overall vote .
the only consolation , if any , for the party is that two of its candidates , petra pau and gesine lötzsch , made it into the german parliament through direct mandates .
but the party is well aware that it will hardly have any influence in parliament with just two members who will henceforth have severely-curtailed rights .
the catastrophic defeat of the pds also meant the loss of jobs for some 200 co-workers of the former socialists in the german parliament .
erosion of party 's traditional stronghold within a day of the crushing defeat , the party ’ s top brass were analyzing the reasons for its dismal showing especially in the east , the party 's power base .
poll results showed that the pds won just a slim 16 percent of the votes in the east instead of the 25 percent that it was gunning for .
the polling institute infratest dimap reported that 300,000 voters in the east who normally vote pds opted for the social democrats this time .
own leadership to blame : gysi the party ’ s most popular politician , gregor gysi - who resigned two months ago as berlin ’ s economics minister - blamed the party ’ s own leadership for the disastrous poll result .
" the party leadership represented itself too much , it struggled too little within and outside the party and wasn ’ t emotional enough , " gysi wrote in the german news magazine , stern , this week .
gysi also wrote that the party did not have the courage to push through a more modern program past the conservatives in the pds .
the pds needs to " rethink itself in a new way , " he wrote .
the charismatic former economics minister of berlin also shouldered some of the blame .
analysts say the party lost a lot of voters , especially in the east , following gysi 's involvement in a frequent flier mile scandal and subsequent resignation in august .
spd uses pds themes to its own advantage political analysts also believe that the pds , which traditionally campaigns on social equality , pacifism and economic advancement for the economically-depressed east was overtaken on those points by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- with their unrelenting stance on iraq and chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s adept handling of the devastating floods in the east .
the berlin polling institute infratest dimap wrote in its election analysis , " the catastrophic floods brought the germans together and with it weakened the pds , that basically survives on the basis of tensions between east and west . "
eckhard jesse , political scientist from chemnitz said in an interview with the news agency dpa that the social democrat-green government had cleverly used iraq to drive home their pacifist colors in the east , a fact that cost the pds quite a number of votes .
party 's future open pds leaders will now take their soul-searching on the party ’ s future to the official party congress in gera in three weeks .
there leaders are expected to thrash out the pds ’ future strategy and decide on the all important question on whether the party should work on being a strong local opposition party in the east or whether it should strive to be back in parliament in the next elections in four years .
former party chief lothar bisky on monday offered some advice at what direction that discussion should take : " one has to reach the people , not just the -lrb- party -rrb- members .

the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .
but in the following years , many of its ideals lived on in german politics , embodied by the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
sunday 's parliamentary elections , however , sounded the final death knell for communism on the national level as it sent the successor to east germany 's communists packing from the parliament .
in a disastrous showing , the pds won neither 5 percent of the national vote nor gained the largest number of votes in three constituencies - the two criteria needed to enter parliament .
the stunning defeat was a bitter pill to swallow .
" there is a need for socialist politics , but it appears we have not been able to get this across sufficiently , " said a visibly resigned gabi zimmer , the party ’ s chairwoman .
worst defeat in party history the defeat is indeed the worst in the party ’ s 12-year history .
it marks the first time since its formation shortly after the fall of the berlin wall that the pds has been denied a place on the national political stage .
in the wake of this election , the pds had been relegated to the status of a local and regional party in eastern germany .
in 1998 , the pds overcame the 5 percent barrier needed for representation and entered the bundestag polling a record 21.6 percent of the votes in the east .
this time , the pds received only 4 percent of the overall vote .
the only consolation , if any , for the party is that two of its candidates , petra pau and gesine lötzsch , made it into the german parliament through direct mandates .
but the party is well aware that it will hardly have any influence in parliament with just two members who will henceforth have severely-curtailed rights .
the catastrophic defeat of the pds also meant the loss of jobs for some 200 co-workers of the former socialists in the german parliament .
erosion of party 's traditional stronghold within a day of the crushing defeat , the party ’ s top brass were analyzing the reasons for its dismal showing especially in the east , the party 's power base .
poll results showed that the pds won just a slim 16 percent of the votes in the east instead of the 25 percent that it was gunning for .
the polling institute infratest dimap reported that 300,000 voters in the east who normally vote pds opted for the social democrats this time .
own leadership to blame : gysi the party ’ s most popular politician , gregor gysi - who resigned two months ago as berlin ’ s economics minister - blamed the party ’ s own leadership for the disastrous poll result .
" the party leadership represented itself too much , it struggled too little within and outside the party and wasn ’ t emotional enough , " gysi wrote in the german news magazine , stern , this week .
gysi also wrote that the party did not have the courage to push through a more modern program past the conservatives in the pds .
the pds needs to " rethink itself in a new way , " he wrote .

germany ’ s church has been struggling with the issue - reluctantly - for years . when the mother of two teenagers went to a health resort , she decided to leave her two children in the care of the southern german priest she trusted .
the children liked him ; he had a computer and video games they could play with .
and as she later found out , he also had almost 60 cases of sexual abuse of children behind him .
in 1999 , he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison .
he was caught , but not due to the church ’ s diligence .
in this and many other cases , the german church has mostly kept quiet about cases of pedophilia .
it is only when those cases come to glaring light that the church breaks its wall of silence , as it has had to in the following cases .
1993 : a 44-year-old priest from the state of hessen is convicted of sexually abusing two sisters .
1995 : a priest from hildesheim admits to inappropriate behaviour with several underage boys .
1996 : a 65-year-old priest from the town of haren is sentenced for 225 cases of abuse .
1999 : a priest from southern germany is sentenced to three and a half years after being convicted of 59 cases of abuse .
2000 : a 60-year-old priest from the coburg area is put on two years probation for sexual abuse .
one victim ’ s father had come forward during a church service and publicly accused the priest of pedophilia .
keep it private germany ’ s catholic church has been as reluctant as its sister church in the us to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many now say , not deal with it at all .
critics accuse the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them .
a priest from the town of krefeld was sentenced in 1994 to four years in jail for abusing a nine-year-old boy .
now the man works in the church archives in the western city of aachen .
the boy he molested still has seen no compensation from the church .
part of the problem , according to some , is that there is no clear line of responsibility within the german church regarding how to deal with sexual abuse .
german bishops often say problems are the responsibility of the individual diocese , whereas many a diocese refers any pedophilia case to the bishop level .
it is easier to pass on the problem than to confront it .
high-level meeting saying it wished to clear up any confusion and set guidelines on how to deal with paedophile priests , germany ’ s bishop ’ s conference made sexual abuse the theme of the regular meeting of its council on monday .
but at the end of the day , the bishops could not come to agreement on regulations regarding abuse cases or guidelines .
cardinal karl lehmann , head of the conference , said the german catholic church would continue to handle sexual abuse cases internally and " discretely " and leave responsibility to each diocese .
" we don ’ t want to cover anything up , " lehmann said , " but we ’ re not talking about the tip of the iceberg here . "
the cardinal from mainz went on to say that the church would reserve the right to carry on its own investigations before involving district attorneys and that a church commission would be responsible for determining the criteria for a case of pedophilia .
" i think we all know what the criteria for pedophilia are , " said annegret laakmann , spokeswoman for we are the church , an international church reform movement .
" nothing came out of this meeting , " she said , " even though it was a good opportunity to start putting changes in place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 24.09.2002 germany 's former communists out in the cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crushed - pds chairwoman gabriele zimmer during early poll results on sunday germany ’ s party of democratic socialism suffered a stinging defeat in the recent elections as it failed to re-enter parliament .
the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .
but in the following years , many of its ideals lived on in german politics , embodied by the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
sunday 's parliamentary elections , however , sounded the final death knell for communism on the national level as it sent the successor to east germany 's communists packing from the parliament .
in a disastrous showing , the pds won neither 5 percent of the national vote nor gained the largest number of votes in three constituencies - the two criteria needed to enter parliament .
the stunning defeat was a bitter pill to swallow .
" there is a need for socialist politics , but it appears we have not been able to get this across sufficiently , " said a visibly resigned gabi zimmer , the party ’ s chairwoman .
worst defeat in party history the defeat is indeed the worst in the party ’ s 12-year history .
it marks the first time since its formation shortly after the fall of the berlin wall that the pds has been denied a place on the national political stage .
in the wake of this election , the pds had been relegated to the status of a local and regional party in eastern germany .
in 1998 , the pds overcame the 5 percent barrier needed for representation and entered the bundestag polling a record 21.6 percent of the votes in the east .
this time , the pds received only 4 percent of the overall vote .
the only consolation , if any , for the party is that two of its candidates , petra pau and gesine lötzsch , made it into the german parliament through direct mandates .
but the party is well aware that it will hardly have any influence in parliament with just two members who will henceforth have severely-curtailed rights .
the catastrophic defeat of the pds also meant the loss of jobs for some 200 co-workers of the former socialists in the german parliament .
erosion of party 's traditional stronghold within a day of the crushing defeat , the party ’ s top brass were analyzing the reasons for its dismal showing especially in the east , the party 's power base .
poll results showed that the pds won just a slim 16 percent of the votes in the east instead of the 25 percent that it was gunning for .
the polling institute infratest dimap reported that 300,000 voters in the east who normally vote pds opted for the social democrats this time .
own leadership to blame : gysi the party ’ s most popular politician , gregor gysi - who resigned two months ago as berlin ’ s economics minister - blamed the party ’ s own leadership for the disastrous poll result .
" the party leadership represented itself too much , it struggled too little within and outside the party and wasn ’ t emotional enough , " gysi wrote in the german news magazine , stern , this week .
gysi also wrote that the party did not have the courage to push through a more modern program past the conservatives in the pds .
the pds needs to " rethink itself in a new way , " he wrote .
the charismatic former economics minister of berlin also shouldered some of the blame .
analysts say the party lost a lot of voters , especially in the east , following gysi 's involvement in a frequent flier mile scandal and subsequent resignation in august .
spd uses pds themes to its own advantage political analysts also believe that the pds , which traditionally campaigns on social equality , pacifism and economic advancement for the economically-depressed east was overtaken on those points by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- with their unrelenting stance on iraq and chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s adept handling of the devastating floods in the east .
the berlin polling institute infratest dimap wrote in its election analysis , " the catastrophic floods brought the germans together and with it weakened the pds , that basically survives on the basis of tensions between east and west . "
eckhard jesse , political scientist from chemnitz said in an interview with the news agency dpa that the social democrat-green government had cleverly used iraq to drive home their pacifist colors in the east , a fact that cost the pds quite a number of votes .

the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .
but in the following years , many of its ideals lived on in german politics , embodied by the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
sunday 's parliamentary elections , however , sounded the final death knell for communism on the national level as it sent the successor to east germany 's communists packing from the parliament .
in a disastrous showing , the pds won neither 5 percent of the national vote nor gained the largest number of votes in three constituencies - the two criteria needed to enter parliament .
the stunning defeat was a bitter pill to swallow .
" there is a need for socialist politics , but it appears we have not been able to get this across sufficiently , " said a visibly resigned gabi zimmer , the party ’ s chairwoman .
worst defeat in party history the defeat is indeed the worst in the party ’ s 12-year history .
it marks the first time since its formation shortly after the fall of the berlin wall that the pds has been denied a place on the national political stage .
in the wake of this election , the pds had been relegated to the status of a local and regional party in eastern germany .
in 1998 , the pds overcame the 5 percent barrier needed for representation and entered the bundestag polling a record 21.6 percent of the votes in the east .
this time , the pds received only 4 percent of the overall vote .
the only consolation , if any , for the party is that two of its candidates , petra pau and gesine lötzsch , made it into the german parliament through direct mandates .
but the party is well aware that it will hardly have any influence in parliament with just two members who will henceforth have severely-curtailed rights .
the catastrophic defeat of the pds also meant the loss of jobs for some 200 co-workers of the former socialists in the german parliament .
erosion of party 's traditional stronghold within a day of the crushing defeat , the party ’ s top brass were analyzing the reasons for its dismal showing especially in the east , the party 's power base .
poll results showed that the pds won just a slim 16 percent of the votes in the east instead of the 25 percent that it was gunning for .
the polling institute infratest dimap reported that 300,000 voters in the east who normally vote pds opted for the social democrats this time .
own leadership to blame : gysi the party ’ s most popular politician , gregor gysi - who resigned two months ago as berlin ’ s economics minister - blamed the party ’ s own leadership for the disastrous poll result .
" the party leadership represented itself too much , it struggled too little within and outside the party and wasn ’ t emotional enough , " gysi wrote in the german news magazine , stern , this week .
gysi also wrote that the party did not have the courage to push through a more modern program past the conservatives in the pds .
the pds needs to " rethink itself in a new way , " he wrote .
the charismatic former economics minister of berlin also shouldered some of the blame .
analysts say the party lost a lot of voters , especially in the east , following gysi 's involvement in a frequent flier mile scandal and subsequent resignation in august .
spd uses pds themes to its own advantage political analysts also believe that the pds , which traditionally campaigns on social equality , pacifism and economic advancement for the economically-depressed east was overtaken on those points by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- with their unrelenting stance on iraq and chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s adept handling of the devastating floods in the east .
the berlin polling institute infratest dimap wrote in its election analysis , " the catastrophic floods brought the germans together and with it weakened the pds , that basically survives on the basis of tensions between east and west . "
eckhard jesse , political scientist from chemnitz said in an interview with the news agency dpa that the social democrat-green government had cleverly used iraq to drive home their pacifist colors in the east , a fact that cost the pds quite a number of votes .

germany 's renewable energy companies got a boost with the green party 's strong showing in sunday 's elections .
but whether four more years of greens in the government is enough to help the slumping market , is still open . the re-election of the environmentally-friendly social democratic-green party coalition government in germany boosted sagging energy stocks on frankfurt ’ s neue markt exchange on monday . companies providing renewable energy such as wind park builder plambeck , umweltkontor and nordex-titel saw their stocks rise between 10 and 30 percent on monday .
analysts attributed the rise directly to the green party ’ s election success . ” the greens emerged strong out of the election , so the insecurity is out of the market , ” wolfgang von geldern , chairman of plambeck , told reuters . plambeck ’ s stock rose 21.4 percent to 10.10 euro on monday .
umweltkontor , which provides solar , wind , water and bio-energy , saw its stock rise 11 percent to 3.35 euro .

the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .
but in the following years , many of its ideals lived on in german politics , embodied by the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
sunday 's parliamentary elections , however , sounded the final death knell for communism on the national level as it sent the successor to east germany 's communists packing from the parliament .
in a disastrous showing , the pds won neither 5 percent of the national vote nor gained the largest number of votes in three constituencies - the two criteria needed to enter parliament .
the stunning defeat was a bitter pill to swallow .
" there is a need for socialist politics , but it appears we have not been able to get this across sufficiently , " said a visibly resigned gabi zimmer , the party ’ s chairwoman .
worst defeat in party history the defeat is indeed the worst in the party ’ s 12-year history .
it marks the first time since its formation shortly after the fall of the berlin wall that the pds has been denied a place on the national political stage .
in the wake of this election , the pds had been relegated to the status of a local and regional party in eastern germany .
in 1998 , the pds overcame the 5 percent barrier needed for representation and entered the bundestag polling a record 21.6 percent of the votes in the east .
this time , the pds received only 4 percent of the overall vote .
the only consolation , if any , for the party is that two of its candidates , petra pau and gesine lötzsch , made it into the german parliament through direct mandates .
but the party is well aware that it will hardly have any influence in parliament with just two members who will henceforth have severely-curtailed rights .
the catastrophic defeat of the pds also meant the loss of jobs for some 200 co-workers of the former socialists in the german parliament .
erosion of party 's traditional stronghold within a day of the crushing defeat , the party ’ s top brass were analyzing the reasons for its dismal showing especially in the east , the party 's power base .
poll results showed that the pds won just a slim 16 percent of the votes in the east instead of the 25 percent that it was gunning for .
the polling institute infratest dimap reported that 300,000 voters in the east who normally vote pds opted for the social democrats this time .
own leadership to blame : gysi the party ’ s most popular politician , gregor gysi - who resigned two months ago as berlin ’ s economics minister - blamed the party ’ s own leadership for the disastrous poll result .
" the party leadership represented itself too much , it struggled too little within and outside the party and wasn ’ t emotional enough , " gysi wrote in the german news magazine , stern , this week .
gysi also wrote that the party did not have the courage to push through a more modern program past the conservatives in the pds .
the pds needs to " rethink itself in a new way , " he wrote .
the charismatic former economics minister of berlin also shouldered some of the blame .
analysts say the party lost a lot of voters , especially in the east , following gysi 's involvement in a frequent flier mile scandal and subsequent resignation in august .
spd uses pds themes to its own advantage political analysts also believe that the pds , which traditionally campaigns on social equality , pacifism and economic advancement for the economically-depressed east was overtaken on those points by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- with their unrelenting stance on iraq and chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s adept handling of the devastating floods in the east .
the berlin polling institute infratest dimap wrote in its election analysis , " the catastrophic floods brought the germans together and with it weakened the pds , that basically survives on the basis of tensions between east and west . "
eckhard jesse , political scientist from chemnitz said in an interview with the news agency dpa that the social democrat-green government had cleverly used iraq to drive home their pacifist colors in the east , a fact that cost the pds quite a number of votes .
party 's future open pds leaders will now take their soul-searching on the party ’ s future to the official party congress in gera in three weeks .
there leaders are expected to thrash out the pds ’ future strategy and decide on the all important question on whether the party should work on being a strong local opposition party in the east or whether it should strive to be back in parliament in the next elections in four years .
former party chief lothar bisky on monday offered some advice at what direction that discussion should take : " one has to reach the people , not just the -lrb- party -rrb- members .

the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .

while the country 's some 1,200 breweries continue to produce roughly the same about of beer , more and more of it has been destined for foreign shores as germans are drinking less of the suds themselves .
per person consumption has dropped from a high of 139 liters in 1994 to a mere 117.7 liters per person in 2003 .
that puts the germans well behind the czech republic 's 160 liters per person and just trailing ireland by 0.3 liters per person .
though it still only has four ingredients , the hops-barley-water-yeast blend is not as simple as first appears .
the purity law explaining " how beer should be served and brewed in summer and winter in the principality , " still applies to beer , but the market is growing to include cola-beer mixes and even beer cocktails .
the changing face of german beer may explain why students from around the world flock to a german brewing school and how the country is able to develop so many variations of the drink that the first teutons used as a sacrifice to the gods .
here a compilation of dw-world 's stories on how a nation of die-hard beer-worshippers to a country that is starting to experiment with its age-old traditions . dw-world.de oetker gulps down brau und brunnen germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .

germany 's renewable energy companies got a boost with the green party 's strong showing in sunday 's elections .
but whether four more years of greens in the government is enough to help the slumping market , is still open . the re-election of the environmentally-friendly social democratic-green party coalition government in germany boosted sagging energy stocks on frankfurt ’ s neue markt exchange on monday . companies providing renewable energy such as wind park builder plambeck , umweltkontor and nordex-titel saw their stocks rise between 10 and 30 percent on monday .
analysts attributed the rise directly to the green party ’ s election success . ” the greens emerged strong out of the election , so the insecurity is out of the market , ” wolfgang von geldern , chairman of plambeck , told reuters . plambeck ’ s stock rose 21.4 percent to 10.10 euro on monday .
umweltkontor , which provides solar , wind , water and bio-energy , saw its stock rise 11 percent to 3.35 euro .
nordex-titel , which makes 40 percent of its sales outside of germany , saw its stock continue to rise .
shares of the wind park constructor were up 30 percent to 4.50 euro . emphasis : renewable energy chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government has made the expansion of renewable energies a priority in the past four years . wind energy in particular has received close attention . green party foreign minister joschka fischer said germany ’ s dependence on wind energy rose from 5 percent to 8 percent of the overall energy-usage during the first four years of red-green . the social democrats made the hassle-free construction of off-shore wind parks part of their election program this year . the coalition has more of the same planned for the next four years .
germany wholeheartedly backed the european union ’ s demand at the recent summit in johannesburg that renewable energies should compromise 14 to 15 percent of the world ’ s energy source by 2010 . the government ’ s policies since coming to power in 1998 sparked rapid expansion in germany ’ s renewable energies market .
with financial credits for renewable energy providers , the coalition boosted the production and long-term planning of germany ’ s energy firms . slumping market , slumping stocks but the market has slumped in recent years , as the availability of land in germany for wind parks has shrunk and companies begin the long process of setting up parks in foreign countries or off-shore .
there are still technical hurdles to overcome in setting up off-shore parks , say analysts , and the first pilot projects aren ’ t due until 2004 . “ for the stock exchange that ’ s too far in the future , ” ronald reepel , a branch analyst with independent research , told the “ sueddeutsche zeitung ” analysts remain split on whether monday ’ s momentum will hold . “ of course the elections had positive effects for those companies ’ business , ” said marcus rehm from sal .

the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .
but in the following years , many of its ideals lived on in german politics , embodied by the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
sunday 's parliamentary elections , however , sounded the final death knell for communism on the national level as it sent the successor to east germany 's communists packing from the parliament .
in a disastrous showing , the pds won neither 5 percent of the national vote nor gained the largest number of votes in three constituencies - the two criteria needed to enter parliament .
the stunning defeat was a bitter pill to swallow .
" there is a need for socialist politics , but it appears we have not been able to get this across sufficiently , " said a visibly resigned gabi zimmer , the party ’ s chairwoman .
worst defeat in party history the defeat is indeed the worst in the party ’ s 12-year history .
it marks the first time since its formation shortly after the fall of the berlin wall that the pds has been denied a place on the national political stage .
in the wake of this election , the pds had been relegated to the status of a local and regional party in eastern germany .
in 1998 , the pds overcame the 5 percent barrier needed for representation and entered the bundestag polling a record 21.6 percent of the votes in the east .
this time , the pds received only 4 percent of the overall vote .
the only consolation , if any , for the party is that two of its candidates , petra pau and gesine lötzsch , made it into the german parliament through direct mandates .
but the party is well aware that it will hardly have any influence in parliament with just two members who will henceforth have severely-curtailed rights .
the catastrophic defeat of the pds also meant the loss of jobs for some 200 co-workers of the former socialists in the german parliament .
erosion of party 's traditional stronghold within a day of the crushing defeat , the party ’ s top brass were analyzing the reasons for its dismal showing especially in the east , the party 's power base .
poll results showed that the pds won just a slim 16 percent of the votes in the east instead of the 25 percent that it was gunning for .
the polling institute infratest dimap reported that 300,000 voters in the east who normally vote pds opted for the social democrats this time .
own leadership to blame : gysi the party ’ s most popular politician , gregor gysi - who resigned two months ago as berlin ’ s economics minister - blamed the party ’ s own leadership for the disastrous poll result .
" the party leadership represented itself too much , it struggled too little within and outside the party and wasn ’ t emotional enough , " gysi wrote in the german news magazine , stern , this week .
gysi also wrote that the party did not have the courage to push through a more modern program past the conservatives in the pds .
the pds needs to " rethink itself in a new way , " he wrote .
the charismatic former economics minister of berlin also shouldered some of the blame .
analysts say the party lost a lot of voters , especially in the east , following gysi 's involvement in a frequent flier mile scandal and subsequent resignation in august .
spd uses pds themes to its own advantage political analysts also believe that the pds , which traditionally campaigns on social equality , pacifism and economic advancement for the economically-depressed east was overtaken on those points by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- with their unrelenting stance on iraq and chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s adept handling of the devastating floods in the east .
the berlin polling institute infratest dimap wrote in its election analysis , " the catastrophic floods brought the germans together and with it weakened the pds , that basically survives on the basis of tensions between east and west . "
eckhard jesse , political scientist from chemnitz said in an interview with the news agency dpa that the social democrat-green government had cleverly used iraq to drive home their pacifist colors in the east , a fact that cost the pds quite a number of votes .
party 's future open pds leaders will now take their soul-searching on the party ’ s future to the official party congress in gera in three weeks .

angela merkel is the unions ' new parliamentary group leader . disappointed by his narrow defeat , conservative candidate edmund stoiber warned that gerhard schröder would face a reinvigorated opposition , forecasting that his government would not last for long . but before the opposition could get down to work , the conservative camp - consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - were split over the question of the conservative parliamentary group leadership . the dispute was ignited as various leading conservatives called for cdu leader angela merkel to become leader of the re-assembled parliamentary group in the new bundestag session .
but on monday afternoon , parliamentary group chairman friedrich merz stepped down from his post , paving the way for merkel to reclaim power over members of parliament from both the cdu and the csu . meteoric career merkel first came into the limelight during the darkest days of the cdu ’ s slush-fund scandal . as the crisis deepened and former chancellor helmut kohl 's prominent role slowly became clear , merkel was the first to make the most of kohl 's downfall .
an interesting position , since he was the one who had plucked her from obscurity and brought her into the cabinet . merkel 's career in the cdu was described by some as a breakthrough for women .
in addition , it was close to a wonder that a traditional party with strong catholic roots would choose an east german leader – or rather , an east german , a woman and a protestant leader . last year , merkel was thought to have good chances to become the conservative ’ s chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
but she was pressured to cede the race to bavarian leader edmund stoiber , as some party big-wigs believed that germany was n't ready for a female chancellor . now , as chair of the bundestag 's parliamentary opposition , merkel has another shot at power . stoiber calls himself ' top representative ' stoiber , meanwhile , did not cede all on monday , saying he would remain the union ’ s “ top representative ” .
he has announced he will focus on foreign policy in the coming weeks , and has already announced a trip to washington , where he will attempt to patch up strained german-american relations . he has pledged that the german government will face a strong opposition and that “ the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time ” . with 306 seats in the german parliament , the red-green coalition may face icy winds from the 295-seat strong parliamentary opposition . but as for stoiber – he will be far from berlin , back at his old job of running bavaria . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 24.09.2002 germany 's former communists out in the cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crushed - pds chairwoman gabriele zimmer during early poll results on sunday germany ’ s party of democratic socialism suffered a stinging defeat in the recent elections as it failed to re-enter parliament .
the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .
but in the following years , many of its ideals lived on in german politics , embodied by the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
sunday 's parliamentary elections , however , sounded the final death knell for communism on the national level as it sent the successor to east germany 's communists packing from the parliament .
in a disastrous showing , the pds won neither 5 percent of the national vote nor gained the largest number of votes in three constituencies - the two criteria needed to enter parliament .
the stunning defeat was a bitter pill to swallow .
" there is a need for socialist politics , but it appears we have not been able to get this across sufficiently , " said a visibly resigned gabi zimmer , the party ’ s chairwoman .
worst defeat in party history the defeat is indeed the worst in the party ’ s 12-year history .
it marks the first time since its formation shortly after the fall of the berlin wall that the pds has been denied a place on the national political stage .
in the wake of this election , the pds had been relegated to the status of a local and regional party in eastern germany .
in 1998 , the pds overcame the 5 percent barrier needed for representation and entered the bundestag polling a record 21.6 percent of the votes in the east .
this time , the pds received only 4 percent of the overall vote .
the only consolation , if any , for the party is that two of its candidates , petra pau and gesine lötzsch , made it into the german parliament through direct mandates .
but the party is well aware that it will hardly have any influence in parliament with just two members who will henceforth have severely-curtailed rights .
the catastrophic defeat of the pds also meant the loss of jobs for some 200 co-workers of the former socialists in the german parliament .
erosion of party 's traditional stronghold within a day of the crushing defeat , the party ’ s top brass were analyzing the reasons for its dismal showing especially in the east , the party 's power base .
poll results showed that the pds won just a slim 16 percent of the votes in the east instead of the 25 percent that it was gunning for .
the polling institute infratest dimap reported that 300,000 voters in the east who normally vote pds opted for the social democrats this time .
own leadership to blame : gysi the party ’ s most popular politician , gregor gysi - who resigned two months ago as berlin ’ s economics minister - blamed the party ’ s own leadership for the disastrous poll result .
" the party leadership represented itself too much , it struggled too little within and outside the party and wasn ’ t emotional enough , " gysi wrote in the german news magazine , stern , this week .
gysi also wrote that the party did not have the courage to push through a more modern program past the conservatives in the pds .
the pds needs to " rethink itself in a new way , " he wrote .
the charismatic former economics minister of berlin also shouldered some of the blame .

there leaders are expected to thrash out the pds ’ future strategy and decide on the all important question on whether the party should work on being a strong local opposition party in the east or whether it should strive to be back in parliament in the next elections in four years .

germany ’ s church has been struggling with the issue - reluctantly - for years . when the mother of two teenagers went to a health resort , she decided to leave her two children in the care of the southern german priest she trusted .
the children liked him ; he had a computer and video games they could play with .
and as she later found out , he also had almost 60 cases of sexual abuse of children behind him .
in 1999 , he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison .
he was caught , but not due to the church ’ s diligence .
in this and many other cases , the german church has mostly kept quiet about cases of pedophilia .
it is only when those cases come to glaring light that the church breaks its wall of silence , as it has had to in the following cases .
1993 : a 44-year-old priest from the state of hessen is convicted of sexually abusing two sisters .
1995 : a priest from hildesheim admits to inappropriate behaviour with several underage boys .
1996 : a 65-year-old priest from the town of haren is sentenced for 225 cases of abuse .
1999 : a priest from southern germany is sentenced to three and a half years after being convicted of 59 cases of abuse .
2000 : a 60-year-old priest from the coburg area is put on two years probation for sexual abuse .
one victim ’ s father had come forward during a church service and publicly accused the priest of pedophilia .
keep it private germany ’ s catholic church has been as reluctant as its sister church in the us to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many now say , not deal with it at all .
critics accuse the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them .
a priest from the town of krefeld was sentenced in 1994 to four years in jail for abusing a nine-year-old boy .
now the man works in the church archives in the western city of aachen .
the boy he molested still has seen no compensation from the church .
part of the problem , according to some , is that there is no clear line of responsibility within the german church regarding how to deal with sexual abuse .
german bishops often say problems are the responsibility of the individual diocese , whereas many a diocese refers any pedophilia case to the bishop level .
it is easier to pass on the problem than to confront it .
high-level meeting saying it wished to clear up any confusion and set guidelines on how to deal with paedophile priests , germany ’ s bishop ’ s conference made sexual abuse the theme of the regular meeting of its council on monday .
but at the end of the day , the bishops could not come to agreement on regulations regarding abuse cases or guidelines .
cardinal karl lehmann , head of the conference , said the german catholic church would continue to handle sexual abuse cases internally and " discretely " and leave responsibility to each diocese .
" we don ’ t want to cover anything up , " lehmann said , " but we ’ re not talking about the tip of the iceberg here . "
the cardinal from mainz went on to say that the church would reserve the right to carry on its own investigations before involving district attorneys and that a church commission would be responsible for determining the criteria for a case of pedophilia .
" i think we all know what the criteria for pedophilia are , " said annegret laakmann , spokeswoman for we are the church , an international church reform movement .
" nothing came out of this meeting , " she said , " even though it was a good opportunity to start putting changes in place .

germany ’ s church has been struggling with the issue - reluctantly - for years . when the mother of two teenagers went to a health resort , she decided to leave her two children in the care of the southern german priest she trusted .
the children liked him ; he had a computer and video games they could play with .
and as she later found out , he also had almost 60 cases of sexual abuse of children behind him .
in 1999 , he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison .
he was caught , but not due to the church ’ s diligence .
in this and many other cases , the german church has mostly kept quiet about cases of pedophilia .
it is only when those cases come to glaring light that the church breaks its wall of silence , as it has had to in the following cases .
1993 : a 44-year-old priest from the state of hessen is convicted of sexually abusing two sisters .
1995 : a priest from hildesheim admits to inappropriate behaviour with several underage boys .
1996 : a 65-year-old priest from the town of haren is sentenced for 225 cases of abuse .
1999 : a priest from southern germany is sentenced to three and a half years after being convicted of 59 cases of abuse .
2000 : a 60-year-old priest from the coburg area is put on two years probation for sexual abuse .
one victim ’ s father had come forward during a church service and publicly accused the priest of pedophilia .
keep it private germany ’ s catholic church has been as reluctant as its sister church in the us to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many now say , not deal with it at all .
critics accuse the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them .
a priest from the town of krefeld was sentenced in 1994 to four years in jail for abusing a nine-year-old boy .
now the man works in the church archives in the western city of aachen .
the boy he molested still has seen no compensation from the church .
part of the problem , according to some , is that there is no clear line of responsibility within the german church regarding how to deal with sexual abuse .
german bishops often say problems are the responsibility of the individual diocese , whereas many a diocese refers any pedophilia case to the bishop level .
it is easier to pass on the problem than to confront it .
high-level meeting saying it wished to clear up any confusion and set guidelines on how to deal with paedophile priests , germany ’ s bishop ’ s conference made sexual abuse the theme of the regular meeting of its council on monday .
but at the end of the day , the bishops could not come to agreement on regulations regarding abuse cases or guidelines .
cardinal karl lehmann , head of the conference , said the german catholic church would continue to handle sexual abuse cases internally and " discretely " and leave responsibility to each diocese .
" we don ’ t want to cover anything up , " lehmann said , " but we ’ re not talking about the tip of the iceberg here . "
the cardinal from mainz went on to say that the church would reserve the right to carry on its own investigations before involving district attorneys and that a church commission would be responsible for determining the criteria for a case of pedophilia .
" i think we all know what the criteria for pedophilia are , " said annegret laakmann , spokeswoman for we are the church , an international church reform movement .
" nothing came out of this meeting , " she said , " even though it was a good opportunity to start putting changes in place .
it ’ s clear the church still wants to cover things up . "
demands for reform her group has demanded that the church put ombudsmen in place to whom children of their parents can report cases of abuse or inappropriate behaviour .
" such a person needs to be completely independent of the bishops or the priests , " laakmann said , " only then can children or adults feel safe to report abuse . "

the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .
but in the following years , many of its ideals lived on in german politics , embodied by the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
sunday 's parliamentary elections , however , sounded the final death knell for communism on the national level as it sent the successor to east germany 's communists packing from the parliament .
in a disastrous showing , the pds won neither 5 percent of the national vote nor gained the largest number of votes in three constituencies - the two criteria needed to enter parliament .
the stunning defeat was a bitter pill to swallow .
" there is a need for socialist politics , but it appears we have not been able to get this across sufficiently , " said a visibly resigned gabi zimmer , the party ’ s chairwoman .
worst defeat in party history the defeat is indeed the worst in the party ’ s 12-year history .
it marks the first time since its formation shortly after the fall of the berlin wall that the pds has been denied a place on the national political stage .
in the wake of this election , the pds had been relegated to the status of a local and regional party in eastern germany .
in 1998 , the pds overcame the 5 percent barrier needed for representation and entered the bundestag polling a record 21.6 percent of the votes in the east .
this time , the pds received only 4 percent of the overall vote .
the only consolation , if any , for the party is that two of its candidates , petra pau and gesine lötzsch , made it into the german parliament through direct mandates .
but the party is well aware that it will hardly have any influence in parliament with just two members who will henceforth have severely-curtailed rights .
the catastrophic defeat of the pds also meant the loss of jobs for some 200 co-workers of the former socialists in the german parliament .
erosion of party 's traditional stronghold within a day of the crushing defeat , the party ’ s top brass were analyzing the reasons for its dismal showing especially in the east , the party 's power base .
poll results showed that the pds won just a slim 16 percent of the votes in the east instead of the 25 percent that it was gunning for .
the polling institute infratest dimap reported that 300,000 voters in the east who normally vote pds opted for the social democrats this time .
own leadership to blame : gysi the party ’ s most popular politician , gregor gysi - who resigned two months ago as berlin ’ s economics minister - blamed the party ’ s own leadership for the disastrous poll result .
" the party leadership represented itself too much , it struggled too little within and outside the party and wasn ’ t emotional enough , " gysi wrote in the german news magazine , stern , this week .
gysi also wrote that the party did not have the courage to push through a more modern program past the conservatives in the pds .
the pds needs to " rethink itself in a new way , " he wrote .
the charismatic former economics minister of berlin also shouldered some of the blame .
analysts say the party lost a lot of voters , especially in the east , following gysi 's involvement in a frequent flier mile scandal and subsequent resignation in august .

the berlin polling institute infratest dimap wrote in its election analysis , " the catastrophic floods brought the germans together and with it weakened the pds , that basically survives on the basis of tensions between east and west . "
eckhard jesse , political scientist from chemnitz said in an interview with the news agency dpa that the social democrat-green government had cleverly used iraq to drive home their pacifist colors in the east , a fact that cost the pds quite a number of votes .
party 's future open pds leaders will now take their soul-searching on the party ’ s future to the official party congress in gera in three weeks .

germany 's renewable energy companies got a boost with the green party 's strong showing in sunday 's elections .
but whether four more years of greens in the government is enough to help the slumping market , is still open . the re-election of the environmentally-friendly social democratic-green party coalition government in germany boosted sagging energy stocks on frankfurt ’ s neue markt exchange on monday . companies providing renewable energy such as wind park builder plambeck , umweltkontor and nordex-titel saw their stocks rise between 10 and 30 percent on monday .
analysts attributed the rise directly to the green party ’ s election success . ” the greens emerged strong out of the election , so the insecurity is out of the market , ” wolfgang von geldern , chairman of plambeck , told reuters . plambeck ’ s stock rose 21.4 percent to 10.10 euro on monday .
umweltkontor , which provides solar , wind , water and bio-energy , saw its stock rise 11 percent to 3.35 euro .
nordex-titel , which makes 40 percent of its sales outside of germany , saw its stock continue to rise .
shares of the wind park constructor were up 30 percent to 4.50 euro . emphasis : renewable energy chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government has made the expansion of renewable energies a priority in the past four years . wind energy in particular has received close attention . green party foreign minister joschka fischer said germany ’ s dependence on wind energy rose from 5 percent to 8 percent of the overall energy-usage during the first four years of red-green . the social democrats made the hassle-free construction of off-shore wind parks part of their election program this year . the coalition has more of the same planned for the next four years .
germany wholeheartedly backed the european union ’ s demand at the recent summit in johannesburg that renewable energies should compromise 14 to 15 percent of the world ’ s energy source by 2010 . the government ’ s policies since coming to power in 1998 sparked rapid expansion in germany ’ s renewable energies market .
with financial credits for renewable energy providers , the coalition boosted the production and long-term planning of germany ’ s energy firms . slumping market , slumping stocks but the market has slumped in recent years , as the availability of land in germany for wind parks has shrunk and companies begin the long process of setting up parks in foreign countries or off-shore .
there are still technical hurdles to overcome in setting up off-shore parks , say analysts , and the first pilot projects aren ’ t due until 2004 . “ for the stock exchange that ’ s too far in the future , ” ronald reepel , a branch analyst with independent research , told the “ sueddeutsche zeitung ” analysts remain split on whether monday ’ s momentum will hold . “ of course the elections had positive effects for those companies ’ business , ” said marcus rehm from sal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 24.09.2002 germany 's former communists out in the cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crushed - pds chairwoman gabriele zimmer during early poll results on sunday germany ’ s party of democratic socialism suffered a stinging defeat in the recent elections as it failed to re-enter parliament .
the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .
but in the following years , many of its ideals lived on in german politics , embodied by the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
sunday 's parliamentary elections , however , sounded the final death knell for communism on the national level as it sent the successor to east germany 's communists packing from the parliament .
in a disastrous showing , the pds won neither 5 percent of the national vote nor gained the largest number of votes in three constituencies - the two criteria needed to enter parliament .
the stunning defeat was a bitter pill to swallow .
" there is a need for socialist politics , but it appears we have not been able to get this across sufficiently , " said a visibly resigned gabi zimmer , the party ’ s chairwoman .
worst defeat in party history the defeat is indeed the worst in the party ’ s 12-year history .
it marks the first time since its formation shortly after the fall of the berlin wall that the pds has been denied a place on the national political stage .
in the wake of this election , the pds had been relegated to the status of a local and regional party in eastern germany .
in 1998 , the pds overcame the 5 percent barrier needed for representation and entered the bundestag polling a record 21.6 percent of the votes in the east .
this time , the pds received only 4 percent of the overall vote .
the only consolation , if any , for the party is that two of its candidates , petra pau and gesine lötzsch , made it into the german parliament through direct mandates .
but the party is well aware that it will hardly have any influence in parliament with just two members who will henceforth have severely-curtailed rights .
the catastrophic defeat of the pds also meant the loss of jobs for some 200 co-workers of the former socialists in the german parliament .
erosion of party 's traditional stronghold within a day of the crushing defeat , the party ’ s top brass were analyzing the reasons for its dismal showing especially in the east , the party 's power base .

gysi also wrote that the party did not have the courage to push through a more modern program past the conservatives in the pds .
the pds needs to " rethink itself in a new way , " he wrote .

the debacle has triggered much soul-searching among party members . the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 officially spelled the end of communism in germany .
but in the following years , many of its ideals lived on in german politics , embodied by the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
sunday 's parliamentary elections , however , sounded the final death knell for communism on the national level as it sent the successor to east germany 's communists packing from the parliament .
in a disastrous showing , the pds won neither 5 percent of the national vote nor gained the largest number of votes in three constituencies - the two criteria needed to enter parliament .
the stunning defeat was a bitter pill to swallow .
" there is a need for socialist politics , but it appears we have not been able to get this across sufficiently , " said a visibly resigned gabi zimmer , the party ’ s chairwoman .
worst defeat in party history the defeat is indeed the worst in the party ’ s 12-year history .
it marks the first time since its formation shortly after the fall of the berlin wall that the pds has been denied a place on the national political stage .
in the wake of this election , the pds had been relegated to the status of a local and regional party in eastern germany .
in 1998 , the pds overcame the 5 percent barrier needed for representation and entered the bundestag polling a record 21.6 percent of the votes in the east .
this time , the pds received only 4 percent of the overall vote .
the only consolation , if any , for the party is that two of its candidates , petra pau and gesine lötzsch , made it into the german parliament through direct mandates .
but the party is well aware that it will hardly have any influence in parliament with just two members who will henceforth have severely-curtailed rights .
the catastrophic defeat of the pds also meant the loss of jobs for some 200 co-workers of the former socialists in the german parliament .
erosion of party 's traditional stronghold within a day of the crushing defeat , the party ’ s top brass were analyzing the reasons for its dismal showing especially in the east , the party 's power base .
poll results showed that the pds won just a slim 16 percent of the votes in the east instead of the 25 percent that it was gunning for .
the polling institute infratest dimap reported that 300,000 voters in the east who normally vote pds opted for the social democrats this time .
own leadership to blame : gysi the party ’ s most popular politician , gregor gysi - who resigned two months ago as berlin ’ s economics minister - blamed the party ’ s own leadership for the disastrous poll result .

germany 's renewable energy companies got a boost with the green party 's strong showing in sunday 's elections .
but whether four more years of greens in the government is enough to help the slumping market , is still open . the re-election of the environmentally-friendly social democratic-green party coalition government in germany boosted sagging energy stocks on frankfurt ’ s neue markt exchange on monday . companies providing renewable energy such as wind park builder plambeck , umweltkontor and nordex-titel saw their stocks rise between 10 and 30 percent on monday .
analysts attributed the rise directly to the green party ’ s election success . ” the greens emerged strong out of the election , so the insecurity is out of the market , ” wolfgang von geldern , chairman of plambeck , told reuters . plambeck ’ s stock rose 21.4 percent to 10.10 euro on monday .
umweltkontor , which provides solar , wind , water and bio-energy , saw its stock rise 11 percent to 3.35 euro .
nordex-titel , which makes 40 percent of its sales outside of germany , saw its stock continue to rise .
shares of the wind park constructor were up 30 percent to 4.50 euro . emphasis : renewable energy chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government has made the expansion of renewable energies a priority in the past four years . wind energy in particular has received close attention . green party foreign minister joschka fischer said germany ’ s dependence on wind energy rose from 5 percent to 8 percent of the overall energy-usage during the first four years of red-green . the social democrats made the hassle-free construction of off-shore wind parks part of their election program this year . the coalition has more of the same planned for the next four years .
germany wholeheartedly backed the european union ’ s demand at the recent summit in johannesburg that renewable energies should compromise 14 to 15 percent of the world ’ s energy source by 2010 . the government ’ s policies since coming to power in 1998 sparked rapid expansion in germany ’ s renewable energies market .
with financial credits for renewable energy providers , the coalition boosted the production and long-term planning of germany ’ s energy firms . slumping market , slumping stocks but the market has slumped in recent years , as the availability of land in germany for wind parks has shrunk and companies begin the long process of setting up parks in foreign countries or off-shore .
there are still technical hurdles to overcome in setting up off-shore parks , say analysts , and the first pilot projects aren ’ t due until 2004 . “ for the stock exchange that ’ s too far in the future , ” ronald reepel , a branch analyst with independent research , told the “ sueddeutsche zeitung ” analysts remain split on whether monday ’ s momentum will hold . “ of course the elections had positive effects for those companies ’ business , ” said marcus rehm from sal .

while the country 's some 1,200 breweries continue to produce roughly the same about of beer , more and more of it has been destined for foreign shores as germans are drinking less of the suds themselves .
per person consumption has dropped from a high of 139 liters in 1994 to a mere 117.7 liters per person in 2003 .
that puts the germans well behind the czech republic 's 160 liters per person and just trailing ireland by 0.3 liters per person .
though it still only has four ingredients , the hops-barley-water-yeast blend is not as simple as first appears .
the purity law explaining " how beer should be served and brewed in summer and winter in the principality , " still applies to beer , but the market is growing to include cola-beer mixes and even beer cocktails .
the changing face of german beer may explain why students from around the world flock to a german brewing school and how the country is able to develop so many variations of the drink that the first teutons used as a sacrifice to the gods .
here a compilation of dw-world 's stories on how a nation of die-hard beer-worshippers to a country that is starting to experiment with its age-old traditions . dw-world.de oetker gulps down brau und brunnen germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry .

germans revere soccer almost as much as they do their beer , so fans of both found it hard to swallow the news that only american beer would be sold in stadiums when germany hosts the world cup .
but things are looking up .

germany ’ s church has been struggling with the issue - reluctantly - for years . when the mother of two teenagers went to a health resort , she decided to leave her two children in the care of the southern german priest she trusted .
the children liked him ; he had a computer and video games they could play with .
and as she later found out , he also had almost 60 cases of sexual abuse of children behind him .
in 1999 , he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison .
he was caught , but not due to the church ’ s diligence .
in this and many other cases , the german church has mostly kept quiet about cases of pedophilia .
it is only when those cases come to glaring light that the church breaks its wall of silence , as it has had to in the following cases .
1993 : a 44-year-old priest from the state of hessen is convicted of sexually abusing two sisters .
1995 : a priest from hildesheim admits to inappropriate behaviour with several underage boys .
1996 : a 65-year-old priest from the town of haren is sentenced for 225 cases of abuse .
1999 : a priest from southern germany is sentenced to three and a half years after being convicted of 59 cases of abuse .
2000 : a 60-year-old priest from the coburg area is put on two years probation for sexual abuse .
one victim ’ s father had come forward during a church service and publicly accused the priest of pedophilia .
keep it private germany ’ s catholic church has been as reluctant as its sister church in the us to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many now say , not deal with it at all .
critics accuse the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them .
a priest from the town of krefeld was sentenced in 1994 to four years in jail for abusing a nine-year-old boy .
now the man works in the church archives in the western city of aachen .
the boy he molested still has seen no compensation from the church .
part of the problem , according to some , is that there is no clear line of responsibility within the german church regarding how to deal with sexual abuse .
german bishops often say problems are the responsibility of the individual diocese , whereas many a diocese refers any pedophilia case to the bishop level .
it is easier to pass on the problem than to confront it .
high-level meeting saying it wished to clear up any confusion and set guidelines on how to deal with paedophile priests , germany ’ s bishop ’ s conference made sexual abuse the theme of the regular meeting of its council on monday .
but at the end of the day , the bishops could not come to agreement on regulations regarding abuse cases or guidelines .
cardinal karl lehmann , head of the conference , said the german catholic church would continue to handle sexual abuse cases internally and " discretely " and leave responsibility to each diocese .
" we don ’ t want to cover anything up , " lehmann said , " but we ’ re not talking about the tip of the iceberg here . "
the cardinal from mainz went on to say that the church would reserve the right to carry on its own investigations before involving district attorneys and that a church commission would be responsible for determining the criteria for a case of pedophilia .
" i think we all know what the criteria for pedophilia are , " said annegret laakmann , spokeswoman for we are the church , an international church reform movement .

angela merkel is the unions ' new parliamentary group leader . disappointed by his narrow defeat , conservative candidate edmund stoiber warned that gerhard schröder would face a reinvigorated opposition , forecasting that his government would not last for long . but before the opposition could get down to work , the conservative camp - consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - were split over the question of the conservative parliamentary group leadership . the dispute was ignited as various leading conservatives called for cdu leader angela merkel to become leader of the re-assembled parliamentary group in the new bundestag session .
but on monday afternoon , parliamentary group chairman friedrich merz stepped down from his post , paving the way for merkel to reclaim power over members of parliament from both the cdu and the csu . meteoric career merkel first came into the limelight during the darkest days of the cdu ’ s slush-fund scandal . as the crisis deepened and former chancellor helmut kohl 's prominent role slowly became clear , merkel was the first to make the most of kohl 's downfall .
an interesting position , since he was the one who had plucked her from obscurity and brought her into the cabinet . merkel 's career in the cdu was described by some as a breakthrough for women .
in addition , it was close to a wonder that a traditional party with strong catholic roots would choose an east german leader – or rather , an east german , a woman and a protestant leader . last year , merkel was thought to have good chances to become the conservative ’ s chancellor candidate in this year ’ s federal elections .
but she was pressured to cede the race to bavarian leader edmund stoiber , as some party big-wigs believed that germany was n't ready for a female chancellor . now , as chair of the bundestag 's parliamentary opposition , merkel has another shot at power . stoiber calls himself ' top representative ' stoiber , meanwhile , did not cede all on monday , saying he would remain the union ’ s “ top representative ” .
he has announced he will focus on foreign policy in the coming weeks , and has already announced a trip to washington , where he will attempt to patch up strained german-american relations . he has pledged that the german government will face a strong opposition and that “ the schröder government will only be able to govern for a very , very short time ” . with 306 seats in the german parliament , the red-green coalition may face icy winds from the 295-seat strong parliamentary opposition . but as for stoiber – he will be far from berlin , back at his old job of running bavaria . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a disabled support charity , " shared care network " is heading the appeal for more volunteers .
the charity 's study has shown that the parents of autistic children are under a great deal of stress and many suffer from exhaustion : half receive no regular help from friends and family a third of children on waiting lists for short break services have some form of autism .
82 per cent say their child needs 24 hour supervision what is autism ?
autism is a developmental disability that affects the way a person communicates and interacts with other people .
people with autism can not relate to others in a meaningful way .
they also have trouble making sense of the world at large .
as a result , their ability to develop friendships is impaired .
they also have a limited capacity to understand other people 's feelings .
autism is often also associated with learning disabilities .
reality to an autistic person is a confusing , interacting mass of events , people , places , sounds and sights .
there seems to be no clear boundaries , order or meaning to anything .
a large part of life is spent just trying to work out the pattern behind everything .
what are the characteristics of autism ?
the national autistic society lists three major areas which cause people with autism serious problems .
they are : social interaction - difficulty with social relationships , for example appearing aloof and indifferent to other people social communication - difficulty with verbal and non-verbal communication , for example not really understanding the meaning of gestures , facial expressions or tone of voice imagination - difficulty in the development of play and imagination , for example having a limited range of imaginative activities , possibly copied and pursued rigidly and repetitively autism is also associated with repetitive behaviour and a refusal to change routine .
what causes autism ?
nobody really knows what causes autism .
however , it is thought that genetic factors are likely to play a crucial role .
research has also linked the condition with a variety of conditions affecting brain development which occur before , during , or very soon after birth .
how is autism diagnosed ?
autism can be difficult to diagnose as it is a complex condition and symptoms are variable .
although the characteristics of autism are generally evident in the first few years of life , the condition can go undetected for many years especially in those who are at the more able end of the spectrum where the signs are more subtle .
however , people with autism do tend to exhibit tell-tale behavioural signs .
these can include tapping parts of the body , rocking , teeth grinding and repetitive grunting .
more complicated behaviours associated with the condition include : intense attachment to particular objects for no apparent purpose a fascination with regular repeated patterns of objects , sounds arranging objects in lines or patterns can people with autism be helped ?
specialist education and structured support are available to help maximise skills and achieve full potential in adulthood .
information is available from the national autistic society helpline on 0870 600 85 85 .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- wales -pipe- road tax cheats targeted news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : uk : wales news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england n ireland scotland wales politics education business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk tuesday , 24 september , 2002 , 06:02 gmt 07:02 uk road tax cheats targeted the ' stingray ' cameras will operate at the roadside motorists in wales who drive vehicles without paying road tax will not be safe from detection in future .
from next month , the driving and vehicle licensing authority -lrb- dvla -rrb- in swansea is launching a network of ' stingray ' cameras around the country which can spot untaxed cars and lorries on the move .
road tax evasion in wales dyfed-powys £ 18m revenue lost with 17,000 unlicensed vehicles south wales £ 35m , 32,000 vehicles gwent police £ 13m , 12000 vehicles north wales £ 22m , 20,000 vehicles it is hoped the initiative will help recover the estimated £ 8.8m lost just last year to road tax-dodgers in wales .
according to the dvla , there are currently around 81,000 unlicensed vehicles in wales , the majority of them in the more built-up areas in the south .
" we are taking a hard line and stepping up our enforcement activity by introducing the stingray cameras in a determined effort to clamp down on this irresponsible group who evade paying their road tax , " said terry barnard , head of enforcement at the dvla .
" honest motorists are infuriated at having to subsidise road tax cheats and it is a constant source of resentment . "
the cameras , which can read the number plates of vehicles travelling at up to 100 miles per hour , were first introduced in england a year ago .
they are also in operation in parts of scotland and northern ireland .
store electronically the dvla is running the scheme in conjunction with all four welsh police forces .
the cameras will operate from lay-bys and over bridges , reading the number plates of passing vehicles .
technology then allows officers to check the numbers against dvla records and store electronically the numbers of those found unlicensed .
unlike speed safety cameras , the ' stingray ' cameras are visible to passing motorists .
" they do not run out of film , they are portable and will be used all over wales , " said mr barnard .
offenders will face fines of up to £ 1,000 for a car or motorbike , and up to £ 23,000 for a heavy goods vehicle .
51,000 vehicles have ended up being crushed wheelclamping of cars without tax discs has been in force across the uk since 1997 .
so far , 99,000 vehicles having been targeted and 51,000 of them have been disposed of by crushing .
new regulations will also come into force for wheel-clamped vehicles which reduces the time clamped vehicles are kept in storage from 35 to 14 days .
after that time , unclaimed vehicles will be crushed .
as well as the new cameras , extra dvla wheelclamping units and police roadside checks will be in operation .
will you be caught by the new stingray cameras ?
or do you think its time for car tax dodgers to be caught on film ?
send us your views send us your comments : name : your e-mail address : country : comments : disclaimer : the bbc will put up as many of your comments as possible but we can not guarantee that all e-mails will be published .
the bbc reserves the right to edit comments that are published .
here are some of your comments : what the dvla fails to tell in its press release is , that if the car is not registered at dvla , the camera is a total waste of time , because they can not trace the proper owner anyway .
so they spend uncecessary money following up that case , when in the fact the ' law breaker ' still gets away with it .
stuart williams , swansea , wales are these the same cameras that were being trialled around the penarth to sully road this week ? .
whatever the camera in the van was doing it seemed to require four seperate police cars , one police motorcycle and twelve police officers standing around doing nothing . what a good use of my tax money !
lyndon , cardiff , wales several readers have posted comments that if a car has no " tax disc " then it is uninsured .
this is not the case .
insurance companies get a little jumpy however , when a car has no mot certificate .
pete smith , uk as an owner of two vehicles -lrb- both of which are taxed -rrb- , i think its about time the dvla did something to catch the people who are ripping off the system chris , uk road tax should be scrapped for motorcycles as they do n't cause congestion or road wear yet fuel costs the same .
tim myerscough , wales let 's stop spending money on expensive technology that needs maintaining and does not actually collect anything other than supposedly legal licence plate numbers .
it would be more efficient to place both road tax and third party insurance on the cost of fuel .
all vehicles moving under their own power would therefore be taxed and insured with minimal effort , in relation to the amount of fuel it uses .
such an idea would be unpopular as those costs that are paid by some of us annually and then forgotten would be seen every time we filled up with fuel .
clive counsell , wales caravans should attract a separate tax so that when stuck behind one , motorists can at least be grateful that the owner is paying extra for holding us up ...
glen , neath simon of anglesey says he is really scared of people without insurance ...
i understood that if the car is unlicensed , any insurance it or the driver has is automatically invalid .
if so , that is more than enough reason to chase unlicenced cars ... apart from the revenue and unfairness reasons .
paul , australia ; ex-cardiff excellent .
at last technology being put to good use by the authorities .
you should not be driving without a tax disc . -lrb- or insurance -rrb- full stop .
if you are , you are no doubt the type that puts two fingers up to society and they deserve all they get .
if you are a law abiding citizen you have nothing to fear .
more of this please .
john randall , wales i and many others struggle each year to find the money for road tax .
it 's so annoying to see so many people flaunting the law and not paying up .
how are the roads supposed to be improved if we do n't pay .
cars that are n't taxed are also usually just the ones that are n't insured or mot 'd either .
this puts motorist and pedestrians alike at risk from faulty non roadworthy vehicles .
j.morgan , wales about time too !
an untaxed vehicle means the vehicle is uninsured -lrb- even if the insurance is paid -rrb- so i 'm glad this system is in place .
why should the untaxed get away with it ?
i pay for the roads so should everyone else , in repsonse to the ones who ' ca n't afford it ' - buy a bike !
ed , wales refering to sam 's -lrb- north wales -rrb- comment below , if motorists drove their vehicles on roads legally with tax and insurance , then the police would n't have to waste time on trivial matters and perhaps then they could spend more time on catching criminals !
do n't forget that in most cases , no tax = no insurance = no mot .
so is it ok to drive like this , injure or even kill someone when not insured - is that trivial sam ?
chris , uk i could not stop laughing when i saw this report .
i have always taxed my car and expect everyone else to do so .
i recently phoned my local police to report a car in my road without road tax , their response was that is nothing to do with them .
i then contacted the dvla to be told that most cars were in the process of being taxed and they , too , have done nothing .
some two months later this car is still parked in my street and is used everyday .
what a complete waste of time .
lower the cost and i 'll think about getting tax for my car .
rd , wales what incentive do i have to tax my car at the end of this month ?
paul francis , rct when will the authorities see sense ?
or is there method in their madness ?
do they really thing that they will be catching criminal road tax dodgers , who are probably also dangerous drivers of dangerous vehicles ?
which are also probably uninsured .
and unregistered .
or are they hoping to catch a lot of law-abiding citizens with more important things on their mind than complying with endless red tape and bureaucracy -lrb- like smaller numbers on new tin signs hidden in hedgerows -rrb- and make endless amounts of money ?
bogush j mann , england this will catch lots of otherwise legal drivers who have missed their tax by a couple of weeks .
it will utterly fail to catch dangerous drivers , unsafe vehicles , nutcases and those millions of untraceable drivers who do n't register their vehicles .
it will also cost more to run than it saves .
let 's spend money on the hopeless road system instead !
andy h , england its the drivers that have no insurance that really scare me , they are the real outlaws !
simon , anglesey maybe if the motorist was n't being hit so hard by the cost of fuel and everything else , they would find it easier to be able to pay road tax .
it would be far better to use the money wasted on these cameras to resurface some of the roads that are now in a dangerous condition .
vincent jones , wales i pay road tax just the same as everyone else , and this new scheme is all well and good but is n't it time the police stopped wasting time on trivial matters and concentrated on catching real criminals !
sam , north wales watch / listen on this story bbc wales 's nick palit " beware , it can tell instantly if you are breaking the law . "

from next month , the driving and vehicle licensing authority -lrb- dvla -rrb- in swansea is launching a network of ' stingray ' cameras around the country which can spot untaxed cars and lorries on the move .
road tax evasion in wales dyfed-powys £ 18m revenue lost with 17,000 unlicensed vehicles south wales £ 35m , 32,000 vehicles gwent police £ 13m , 12000 vehicles north wales £ 22m , 20,000 vehicles it is hoped the initiative will help recover the estimated £ 8.8m lost just last year to road tax-dodgers in wales .
according to the dvla , there are currently around 81,000 unlicensed vehicles in wales , the majority of them in the more built-up areas in the south .
have your say " we are taking a hard line and stepping up our enforcement activity by introducing the stingray cameras in a determined effort to clamp down on this irresponsible group who evade paying their road tax , " said terry barnard , head of enforcement at the dvla .
" honest motorists are infuriated at having to subsidise road tax cheats and it is a constant source of resentment . "
the cameras , which can read the number plates of vehicles travelling at up to 100 miles per hour , were first introduced in england a year ago .
they are also in operation in parts of scotland and northern ireland .
store electronically the dvla is running the scheme in conjunction with all four welsh police forces .
the cameras will operate from lay-bys and over bridges , reading the number plates of passing vehicles .
technology then allows officers to check the numbers against dvla records and store electronically the numbers of those found unlicensed .
unlike speed safety cameras , the ' stingray ' cameras are visible to passing motorists .
" they do not run out of film , they are portable and will be used all over wales , " said mr barnard .
offenders will face fines of up to £ 1,000 for a car or motorbike , and up to £ 23,000 for a heavy goods vehicle .
wheelclamping of cars without tax discs has been in force across the uk since 1997 .
so far , 99,000 vehicles having been targeted and 51,000 of them have been disposed of by crushing .
new regulations will also come into force for wheel-clamped vehicles which reduces the time clamped vehicles are kept in storage from 35 to 14 days .
after that time , unclaimed vehicles will be crushed .
as well as the new cameras , extra dvla wheelclamping units and police roadside checks will be in operation .
will you be caught by the new stingray cameras ?
or do you think its time for car tax dodgers to be caught on film ?
send us your views send us your comments : name : your e-mail address : country : comments : disclaimer : the bbc will put up as many of your comments as possible but we can not guarantee that all e-mails will be published .
the bbc reserves the right to edit comments that are published .
here are some of your comments : what the dvla fails to tell in its press release is , that if the car is not registered at dvla , the camera is a total waste of time , because they can not trace the proper owner anyway .
so they spend uncecessary money following up that case , when in the fact the ' law breaker ' still gets away with it .
stuart williams , swansea , wales are these the same cameras that were being trialled around the penarth to sully road this week ? .
whatever the camera in the van was doing it seemed to require four seperate police cars , one police motorcycle and twelve police officers standing around doing nothing . what a good use of my tax money !
lyndon , cardiff , wales several readers have posted comments that if a car has no " tax disc " then it is uninsured .
this is not the case .
insurance companies get a little jumpy however , when a car has no mot certificate .
pete smith , uk as an owner of two vehicles -lrb- both of which are taxed -rrb- , i think its about time the dvla did something to catch the people who are ripping off the system chris , uk road tax should be scrapped for motorcycles as they do n't cause congestion or road wear yet fuel costs the same .
tim myerscough , wales let 's stop spending money on expensive technology that needs maintaining and does not actually collect anything other than supposedly legal licence plate numbers .
it would be more efficient to place both road tax and third party insurance on the cost of fuel .
all vehicles moving under their own power would therefore be taxed and insured with minimal effort , in relation to the amount of fuel it uses .
such an idea would be unpopular as those costs that are paid by some of us annually and then forgotten would be seen every time we filled up with fuel .
clive counsell , wales caravans should attract a separate tax so that when stuck behind one , motorists can at least be grateful that the owner is paying extra for holding us up ...
glen , neath simon of anglesey says he is really scared of people without insurance ...
i understood that if the car is unlicensed , any insurance it or the driver has is automatically invalid .
if so , that is more than enough reason to chase unlicenced cars ... apart from the revenue and unfairness reasons .
paul , australia ; ex-cardiff excellent .
at last technology being put to good use by the authorities .
you should not be driving without a tax disc . -lrb- or insurance -rrb- full stop .
if you are , you are no doubt the type that puts two fingers up to society and they deserve all they get .
if you are a law abiding citizen you have nothing to fear .
more of this please .
john randall , wales i and many others struggle each year to find the money for road tax .
it 's so annoying to see so many people flaunting the law and not paying up .
how are the roads supposed to be improved if we do n't pay .
cars that are n't taxed are also usually just the ones that are n't insured or mot 'd either .
this puts motorist and pedestrians alike at risk from faulty non roadworthy vehicles .
j.morgan , wales about time too !
an untaxed vehicle means the vehicle is uninsured -lrb- even if the insurance is paid -rrb- so i 'm glad this system is in place .
why should the untaxed get away with it ?
i pay for the roads so should everyone else , in repsonse to the ones who ' ca n't afford it ' - buy a bike !
ed , wales refering to sam 's -lrb- north wales -rrb- comment below , if motorists drove their vehicles on roads legally with tax and insurance , then the police would n't have to waste time on trivial matters and perhaps then they could spend more time on catching criminals !
do n't forget that in most cases , no tax = no insurance = no mot .
so is it ok to drive like this , injure or even kill someone when not insured - is that trivial sam ?
chris , uk i could not stop laughing when i saw this report .
i have always taxed my car and expect everyone else to do so .
i recently phoned my local police to report a car in my road without road tax , their response was that is nothing to do with them .
i then contacted the dvla to be told that most cars were in the process of being taxed and they , too , have done nothing .
some two months later this car is still parked in my street and is used everyday .
what a complete waste of time .
lower the cost and i 'll think about getting tax for my car .
rd , wales what incentive do i have to tax my car at the end of this month ?
paul francis , rct when will the authorities see sense ?
or is there method in their madness ?
do they really thing that they will be catching criminal road tax dodgers , who are probably also dangerous drivers of dangerous vehicles ?
which are also probably uninsured .
and unregistered .
or are they hoping to catch a lot of law-abiding citizens with more important things on their mind than complying with endless red tape and bureaucracy -lrb- like smaller numbers on new tin signs hidden in hedgerows -rrb- and make endless amounts of money ?
bogush j mann , england this will catch lots of otherwise legal drivers who have missed their tax by a couple of weeks .
it will utterly fail to catch dangerous drivers , unsafe vehicles , nutcases and those millions of untraceable drivers who do n't register their vehicles .
it will also cost more to run than it saves .
let 's spend money on the hopeless road system instead !
andy h , england its the drivers that have no insurance that really scare me , they are the real outlaws !
simon , anglesey maybe if the motorist was n't being hit so hard by the cost of fuel and everything else , they would find it easier to be able to pay road tax .
it would be far better to use the money wasted on these cameras to resurface some of the roads that are now in a dangerous condition .
vincent jones , wales i pay road tax just the same as everyone else , and this new scheme is all well and good but is n't it time the police stopped wasting time on trivial matters and concentrated on catching real criminals !

this is considerably higher than the prices previously paid for similar-sized developers , but highlights the increased competition to secure exclusive links with games developers which can make or break the success of a new console .

exclusive rights rare 's software for nintendo consoles had fallen from 9.5 % of the group 's sales in the year to march 2001 to just 1.5 % a year later .

the former soviet republic has been named in several reports as one of the suppliers of sensitive materials and technologies to saddam hussein . "
our country does n't have the clout to defy the international community , and we simply do n't have weapons of mass destruction " president alexander lukashenko interviewed by the bbc the belarussian president alexander lukashenko emphatically denied any wrongdoing .
mr lukashenko looked visibly angry when told that his country was accused of aiding and abetting iraq in its efforts to create weapons of mass destruction .
he lambasted the west for what he called " thoughtless and senseless statements " .
he said belarus had very good relations with iraq , but entirely within the framework of the un sanctions regime .
" our country does n't have the clout to defy the international community , and we simply do n't have weapons of mass destruction .
belarus is advanced in optics , mathematics and electronics , without which no weapons are possible .
we supply these products all over the world , with the exception of iraq .
can you guarantee that our binoculars sold to a british company wo n't end up in a problem country ? "
strict controls alexander lukashenko said that , before he was elected president in 1994 , belarus had been selling off stockpiles of soviet arms to obscure customers .
but he boasted of setting up a system which requires approval of four committees to sell , as he put it , even a single bullet .
he expressed his frustration with the un sanctions , though , saying they were holding back belarussian exports to iraq .
having been ostracised by the west for his authoritarian rule , minsk is looking to the middle east for business opportunities .
some of these exchanges may be a bit sensitive , says the head of a belarussian think tank leonid zaiko .
" some of the belarussians , especially scientific research specialist take part in this programme for training in arabic countries , in iraq especially .
in our military complex they usually have specialists in the anti-missiles systems , " mr zaiko says .
minsk has seen several high level iraqi delegations in recent months .
officially , they discussed trade and scientific exchanges worth millions of dollars .
one of the delegations was led by the iraqi minister for military industrialisation .
this alone may send alarm bells ringing in washington and london .

strict controls alexander lukashenko said that , before he was elected president in 1994 , belarus had been selling off stockpiles of soviet arms to obscure customers .
but he boasted of setting up a system which requires approval of four committees to sell , as he put it , even a single bullet .
he expressed his frustration with the un sanctions , though , saying they were holding back belarussian exports to iraq .
having been ostracised by the west for his authoritarian rule , minsk is looking to the middle east for business opportunities .
some of these exchanges may be a bit sensitive , says the head of a belarussian think tank leonid zaiko .
" some of the belarussians , especially scientific research specialist take part in this programme for training in arabic countries , in iraq especially .
in our military complex they usually have specialists in the anti-missiles systems , " mr zaiko says .
minsk has seen several high level iraqi delegations in recent months .
officially , they discussed trade and scientific exchanges worth millions of dollars .
one of the delegations was led by the iraqi minister for military industrialisation .

" we need companies to invest in our salt mines so that we can produce the critical mass that will allow nigeria to import from us , " kwamena bartels , minister for private sector development , told bbc news online .
nigeria buys $ 1.5bn-worth of salt a year , in order to feed both domestic demand and its oil industry .
this salt is now primarily imported from australia and brazil , while ghana 's salt reserves remain largely untapped .
mr bartels says an investment of up to $ 150m would be enough to start producing enough salt to start winning trade contracts with nigeria .
seeking poverty solutions the emphasis on salt comes as part of a wider drive to increase foreign direct investment into ghana .
" i am disappointed with our growth rate of about 4 % , " ghana 's finance minister yaw osafo-maafo said .
" we can not reduce poverty by growing at these rates , " he told the commonwealth business council .
" now is the time for ghana to receive its fair share of foreign investment , and we must concentrate on the private sector . "
amongst other industries , ghana is also hoping to attract more investment for its cocoa , magnesium , gold and timber industries in particular .
true democracy political stability is the key factor in ensuring that the funds now start flowing into ghana , mr osafo-maafo told bbc news online .
mr osafo-maafo admits that ghana has suffered turbulence during its 44 years of independence , but believes a new era has begun .
" a democratically-elected government has just handed power over to another democratically-elected government , " he said .
" that to me is the beginning of stability in ghana . "
and mr osafo-maafo was keen to stress that ghana - as arguably the most developed and most stable country in west africa - is the region 's hotspot for future investment .
" if you had money to invest , would you chose nigeria or ghana ? "

what about liberal democrat education policies and the fall-out from the a-level inquiry ?
as the conference got underway , you put your questions to the liberal democrats education spokesman phil willis .
transcript newshost : welcome mr willis .
the issue of iraq is hanging over this conference as with the others .
mps are being recalled tomorrow to parliament partly as a result of the campaign kicked off by your leader , charles kennedy .
can i ask you first , do you think this debate will actually change anything or do you think tony blair and george bush have already made their minds up ?
phil willis : well i hope they have n't but i suspect they have .
i think that all the signs coming out of washington and particularly the aftermath of george bush 's statement to the un was a clear ultimatum to the un - either back a resolution that i 'll write or indeed i 'll go ahead without you .
i think the threat of bush to go ahead unilaterally is an issue which clearly tony blair has got to address and one which i think parliament will address tomorrow .
newshost : it leaves tony blair on a bit of a hook really does n't it if the un do n't fall in line ?
unilateral action will not go down well with the rest of the world and certainly wo n't go down well , i would n't have thought , with his own back-benchers .
phil willis : i think charles kennedy in his speech today to conference was very measured .
i think one of the issues that he did raise , is this question of what happens next .
he did raise the issue about the arab world and particularly the muslim community across the world and the divisions that that would cause .
he also made reference to what would actually happen in the middle east .
i think for many of us that is one of the real worries about that there is no natural successor to saddam hussein and that the whole problems within that region are very , very fraught .
newshost : you fear that things might end up worse after the event , rather than better with lots of iraqi lives lost in the interim time ?
phil willis : i think claire short was right was right to talk about the loss of iraqi lives .
the iraqi population has suffered immeasurably over the last ten years .
but it is really the vacuum that will be created in the middle east - the loss of thousands of lives that will follow as a result .
it will be the almighty number of small skirmishes that actually arise because it 's not just an iraq versus the united states and britain , it in fact within iraq there are at least four different communities all of whom will be fighting for power .
newshost : but presumably you do n't agree that we can just let saddam hussein carry on building weapons of mass destruction ?
phil willis : i think what 's amazing to myself and indeed to many people in the house of commons of all political persuasion is that why has this crisis just arisen now .
there is no clear evidence , unless it 's presented tomorrow morning , that in fact saddam hussein is about to become more dangerous than he 's been over the last five , six , seven , eight or ten years .
newshost : what 's your theory as to why it has happened now ?
phil willis : i hope i can dismiss purely the oil - the economic - theory because i think that 's too simplistic a way of actually looking at this .
i do believe there is an issue of weapons mass destruction that needs to be addressed .
when you look at how many tonnes of chemical and biological weaponry were actually destroyed when our weapon inspectors were actually there , you have to question what in fact has been produced since 1998 .
i think the un is absolutely right to say , look we have to get back in there , we have to inspect and we have to make sure that this man is not only the pariah that the united states thinks he is , but that he is a pariah in the middle east and a pariah in the rest of the world .
newshost : and the turning point , you think , for the un on this ?
phil willis : my worry here is - i am a great supporter of the un but also a great supporter of un reform - it desperately needs reform , it desperately needs more teeth , it desperately needs to have new ways of actually policing the world 's trouble spots .
but this is a defining moment for the un .
if in fact george w bush simply says , i am going it alone with or without britain , what he is basically saying to the united nations is that you are now redundant .
and i wonder what other world force is available to actually fill that vacuum that will be created .
newshost : we 've had a lot of questions on the a-level fiasco - as some people are calling it .
one question , about estelle morris and her role in this .
do you think that as secretary of state - the bottom line - she should take responsibility for this and quit ?
phil willis : first of all i think she should take responsibility .
whether she quits at the end of the day , i think , will depend on mike tomlinson 's inquiry .
i was one of the people who very vociferously called for an independent inquiry and who wanted to see that inquiry .
estelle morris in fact basically sacked qca in terms of having their own inquiry and said look we will have it independent , it will be thorough and we 'll invite mike tomlinson to do so .
i think to call for her resignation or indeed any other minister 's resignation before we 've got the results of that inquiry would be wrong .
but i make this very clear and i 've it clear elsewhere and certainly to the conference , that if in fact there is a single fingerprint from any government minister on this debacle this summer , then not only the secretary of state but other ministers responsible should in fact consider their positions and that includes the conspicuously absent david milliband who has suddenly returned from his travels in scotland .
newshost : a lot of people have been worried about plans to perhaps scrap a-levels as a result of this fiasco .
charles , uk asks : perhaps we should abandon a-levels altogether now they 've been completely discredited and move instead towards the international baccalaureate that is centrally administered from switzerland and would be completely free from political interference of any sort .
phil willis : our party 's position and indeed i set this out in january in huddersfield at the north of england conference , is that we actually support the international baccalaureate .
what i do n't want us to see however - and it looks as if estelle morris is going to do this - is jumping from the present debacle - which has only been in for two years .
the new a-level and as-levels have only been here for two years .
to simply abandon those and jump into a new system would be quite wrong .
we need to see a comprehensive review of the whole of exam structure from 14 to 19 .
we need a new framework and we need variation in our examination systems because whilst the international baccalaureate is great if you are in full-time education from 16 to 19 , it is n't if you are for instance a mature student who is wanting to gain qualifications to go to university .
so it 's not an either or , it 's about horses for courses .
newshost : claire , gloucester , uk : it is absurd that people are now talking about changing the exam system to the baccalaureate which i believe would increase administration and paperwork for teachers without actually improving standards .
the lesson the be learnt from the fiasco is that exam boards should be independent and free from government intervention .
phil willis : well i go halfway with her there because i think the latter part of her e-mail is clearly right .
the qualifications and curriculum authority has to go .
we have to have an independent examination structure .
again i prefer to have one single board to do that - totally independent of government - an organisation which in fact monitors itself together with its schools and indeed with the business community as a whole .
in terms of saying no to the international baccalaureate , certainly it should n't just be used as a panic measure by government .
there are many schools who already use the baccalaureate .
in wales they are considering introducing a welsh baccalaureate .
i want to see schools have the sorts of freedoms and autonomy to be able to say - we want a curricula framework which is right for our school and then have an examination system which in fact examines the veracity of it .
newshost : john wallis , uk : are faith schools a force for evil in society because they are divisive ?
phil willis : well i think people have been asking that question ever since 1870 - w e forster 's act and clause which allowed in fact the current compromise about religious teaching in schools was created then .
i think this is a very , very important issue .
i do n't think church schools - as i prefer to call them - are in fact a force for evil - i think to say that is quite wrong .
the vast majority of church schools deliver an incredibly good product and are comprehensive in their intake and comprehensive in the way in which they represent their communities .
my great worry and it came out of the riots in bradford , oldham and burnley - it came out of the increased polarisation that we 've seen since september 11th is that by having single faith schools which are based on ethnicity and race and religion , what we may well see are huge divisions in our society .
i called at our spring conference - and i think got support in spirit rather than on the floor - to actually look for reforming the issue of admissions .
i do n't want to see single faith schools that are just for one faith .
i do n't mind a faith running a school , whether it be church of england or indeed the muslim community or the sikh community .
but i want those schools to be open for all because the values which islam brings , the values which sikhism or buddhism brings or christianity is something which i do n't think would affect children adversely .
my worry is when you get extremism within those faiths which then does worry me enormously .
newshost : the one that is often raised is that if an organisation like the nation of islam , for example , wanted to start a school , it appears under the current system that as long as they said they were following national curriculum that would be acceptable .
phil willis : it would and in fact i had this arguments with stephen timms when he was the minister of school standards - and i am sure he 's glad he 's gone at this moment in time - and that was about creationism .
when you look for instance at the schools which peter vardy is in fact funding - a well known creationist - with heads of science who are saying that the theory of evolution must go , that the world was created and that creationism is the overriding positive theory - then it 's at that point i get very , very worried indeed .
newshost : would n't it just be simpler to leave religion at home ?
phil willis : of course it would and if we were started again back in 1870 , we would n't have this situation .
but our state education system has always been a compromise .
it grew out of the church schools - the non-conformist and the church of england - and it was the state that filled in the gap and increasingly the state has filled more of that gap , particularly at secondary level because the churches could n't afford to do it .
i think there is a great difference between a school being run by a faith and a faith using a school as an indoctrinatory process .
it is that element that most of the education world and indeed most of the british community would shy away from .
newshost : paul evans , uk : as labour has moved to the centre ground , the liberal democrats have moved to the left and they 've taken up what looks very much like labour 's old " tax and spend " position .
how can you be in opposition if you are saying the same things as labour and have the ambition to be the real opposition ?
phil willis : i think if we 're saying the same thing as labour , then it 's time i left the party because it 's not the party i want to be in .
newshost : but paul seems to be suggesting that you 're saying something even to the left of the current labour party .
phil willis : in reality the new labour party has actually moved to the right of the tories - it 's now a centre-right party rather than a centre-left party .
i 'm actually proud of my centre-left credentials and i make no bones about that .
in terms of tax and spend , we 've argued really since the 1992 general election that in order to fund quality public services you really have to put money into the pot .
newshost : the labour party are doing that .
phil willis : i am delighted that they have to some extent because in the 1992 election , the 1997 election and even the 2001 election - it was these liberals , these awful people that actually wanted to raise your taxes to fund your public services .
and of course labour have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to actually recognise that to put money into health , to put money into education , taxation has to be raised in one form or another .
even the tories are saying the same thing , so heaven help us , something must be going on .
newshost : geoffrey payne , uk : you should aspire to being a left-wing party , particularly in international relations .
you have to be a left of centre party .
the alternative will mean that you are no different to the other parties .
you should not be tempted by free-market dogma , but champion public services and make the environment a number one priority .
the conservatives and new labour are too close to the biggest villain - the usa .
phil willis : well we are often accused of being too close to europe so i think we win on the last point .
but i think jeff is right in his assessment - i do n't like the right and left concepts - i think they 're very old hat .
but i think as a party our overriding aim has got to represent the individual .
we have to fight for the individual .
i think for too long , not only our party but indeed the other parties , have actually been the supporters of organisations - perhaps it was the trade unions , perhaps it was business .
i think that the individual has lost out in this with quality public services - it 's about delivering services to people who ca n't advocate for themselves but who desperately need those services , sometimes just to survive .

phil willis : my worry here is - i am a great supporter of the un but also a great supporter of un reform - it desperately needs reform , it desperately needs more teeth , it desperately needs to have new ways of actually policing the world 's trouble spots .
but this is a defining moment for the un .
if in fact george w bush simply says , i am going it alone with or without britain , what he is basically saying to the united nations is that you are now redundant .
and i wonder what other world force is available to actually fill that vacuum that will be created .
newshost : we 've had a lot of questions on the a-level fiasco - as some people are calling it .
one question , about estelle morris and her role in this .
do you think that as secretary of state - the bottom line - she should take responsibility for this and quit ?
phil willis : first of all i think she should take responsibility .
whether she quits at the end of the day , i think , will depend on mike tomlinson 's inquiry .
i was one of the people who very vociferously called for an independent inquiry and who wanted to see that inquiry .
estelle morris in fact basically sacked qca in terms of having their own inquiry and said look we will have it independent , it will be thorough and we 'll invite mike tomlinson to do so .
i think to call for her resignation or indeed any other minister 's resignation before we 've got the results of that inquiry would be wrong .
but i make this very clear and i 've it clear elsewhere and certainly to the conference , that if in fact there is a single fingerprint from any government minister on this debacle this summer , then not only the secretary of state but other ministers responsible should in fact consider their positions and that includes the conspicuously absent david milliband who has suddenly returned from his travels in scotland .
newshost : a lot of people have been worried about plans to perhaps scrap a-levels as a result of this fiasco .
charles , uk asks : perhaps we should abandon a-levels altogether now they 've been completely discredited and move instead towards the international baccalaureate that is centrally administered from switzerland and would be completely free from political interference of any sort .
phil willis : our party 's position and indeed i set this out in january in huddersfield at the north of england conference , is that we actually support the international baccalaureate .
what i do n't want us to see however - and it looks as if estelle morris is going to do this - is jumping from the present debacle - which has only been in for two years .
the new a-level and as-levels have only been here for two years .
to simply abandon those and jump into a new system would be quite wrong .
we need to see a comprehensive review of the whole of exam structure from 14 to 19 .
we need a new framework and we need variation in our examination systems because whilst the international baccalaureate is great if you are in full-time education from 16 to 19 , it is n't if you are for instance a mature student who is wanting to gain qualifications to go to university .
so it 's not an either or , it 's about horses for courses .
newshost : claire , gloucester , uk : it is absurd that people are now talking about changing the exam system to the baccalaureate which i believe would increase administration and paperwork for teachers without actually improving standards .
the lesson the be learnt from the fiasco is that exam boards should be independent and free from government intervention .
phil willis : well i go halfway with her there because i think the latter part of her e-mail is clearly right .
the qualifications and curriculum authority has to go .
we have to have an independent examination structure .
again i prefer to have one single board to do that - totally independent of government - an organisation which in fact monitors itself together with its schools and indeed with the business community as a whole .
in terms of saying no to the international baccalaureate , certainly it should n't just be used as a panic measure by government .
there are many schools who already use the baccalaureate .
in wales they are considering introducing a welsh baccalaureate .
i want to see schools have the sorts of freedoms and autonomy to be able to say - we want a curricula framework which is right for our school and then have an examination system which in fact examines the veracity of it .
newshost : john wallis , uk : are faith schools a force for evil in society because they are divisive ?
phil willis : well i think people have been asking that question ever since 1870 - w e forster 's act and clause which allowed in fact the current compromise about religious teaching in schools was created then .
i think this is a very , very important issue .
i do n't think church schools - as i prefer to call them - are in fact a force for evil - i think to say that is quite wrong .
the vast majority of church schools deliver an incredibly good product and are comprehensive in their intake and comprehensive in the way in which they represent their communities .
my great worry and it came out of the riots in bradford , oldham and burnley - it came out of the increased polarisation that we 've seen since september 11th is that by having single faith schools which are based on ethnicity and race and religion , what we may well see are huge divisions in our society .
i called at our spring conference - and i think got support in spirit rather than on the floor - to actually look for reforming the issue of admissions .
i do n't want to see single faith schools that are just for one faith .
i do n't mind a faith running a school , whether it be church of england or indeed the muslim community or the sikh community .
but i want those schools to be open for all because the values which islam brings , the values which sikhism or buddhism brings or christianity is something which i do n't think would affect children adversely .
my worry is when you get extremism within those faiths which then does worry me enormously .
newshost : the one that is often raised is that if an organisation like the nation of islam , for example , wanted to start a school , it appears under the current system that as long as they said they were following national curriculum that would be acceptable .
phil willis : it would and in fact i had this arguments with stephen timms when he was the minister of school standards - and i am sure he 's glad he 's gone at this moment in time - and that was about creationism .
when you look for instance at the schools which peter vardy is in fact funding - a well known creationist - with heads of science who are saying that the theory of evolution must go , that the world was created and that creationism is the overriding positive theory - then it 's at that point i get very , very worried indeed .
newshost : would n't it just be simpler to leave religion at home ?
phil willis : of course it would and if we were started again back in 1870 , we would n't have this situation .
but our state education system has always been a compromise .
it grew out of the church schools - the non-conformist and the church of england - and it was the state that filled in the gap and increasingly the state has filled more of that gap , particularly at secondary level because the churches could n't afford to do it .
i think there is a great difference between a school being run by a faith and a faith using a school as an indoctrinatory process .
it is that element that most of the education world and indeed most of the british community would shy away from .
newshost : paul evans , uk : as labour has moved to the centre ground , the liberal democrats have moved to the left and they 've taken up what looks very much like labour 's old " tax and spend " position .
how can you be in opposition if you are saying the same things as labour and have the ambition to be the real opposition ?
phil willis : i think if we 're saying the same thing as labour , then it 's time i left the party because it 's not the party i want to be in .
newshost : but paul seems to be suggesting that you 're saying something even to the left of the current labour party .
phil willis : in reality the new labour party has actually moved to the right of the tories - it 's now a centre-right party rather than a centre-left party .
i 'm actually proud of my centre-left credentials and i make no bones about that .
in terms of tax and spend , we 've argued really since the 1992 general election that in order to fund quality public services you really have to put money into the pot .
newshost : the labour party are doing that .
phil willis : i am delighted that they have to some extent because in the 1992 election , the 1997 election and even the 2001 election - it was these liberals , these awful people that actually wanted to raise your taxes to fund your public services .
and of course labour have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to actually recognise that to put money into health , to put money into education , taxation has to be raised in one form or another .
even the tories are saying the same thing , so heaven help us , something must be going on .
newshost : geoffrey payne , uk : you should aspire to being a left-wing party , particularly in international relations .
you have to be a left of centre party .
the alternative will mean that you are no different to the other parties .
you should not be tempted by free-market dogma , but champion public services and make the environment a number one priority .
the conservatives and new labour are too close to the biggest villain - the usa .
phil willis : well we are often accused of being too close to europe so i think we win on the last point .
but i think jeff is right in his assessment - i do n't like the right and left concepts - i think they 're very old hat .
but i think as a party our overriding aim has got to represent the individual .
we have to fight for the individual .
i think for too long , not only our party but indeed the other parties , have actually been the supporters of organisations - perhaps it was the trade unions , perhaps it was business .
i think that the individual has lost out in this with quality public services - it 's about delivering services to people who ca n't advocate for themselves but who desperately need those services , sometimes just to survive .

"
it 's hard to talk of pure online stuff ... there 'll be a lot of offline involvement in any transaction " duncan clark , bda china analyst in countless identikit ads , a smiling chinese girl searches the web , zeroes in on the firm 's logo , finds her purchase in seconds and receives it in days .
the reality is somewhat different .
" e-commerce is practically non-existent " in china , says ken dewoskin , a partner in the beijing offices of accountants pricewaterhousecoopers .
where it does exist , chinese e-commerce is a world away from the smooth , all-over-in-seconds transactions imagined in corporate promos .
even a projected growth rate of 243 % in 1998-2003 leaves e-commerce in china lagging south korea and australia .
the latter country 's population would fit into the city of shanghai .
california dreaming the reasons for this tardy take-off are many and complex - few chinese have credit cards , the banking sector lacks a national clearing system and potential customers are suspicious of being cheated . "
i 've visited online shops but i did n't use them because i did n't have a credit card " liu hong only 2.1 % of china 's 45 million web users have bought online , according to official figures released in january by cnnic , the official data collector .
about 40 % of the sellers using online auction site eachnet pick a buyer in their home town so that they can swap the goods for cash face-to-face , says mark fagan , the site 's chief financial officer .
in such cases , the website acts as an electronic advertisement , with bidding taking place online but markets remain localised .
about 80 % of deals between users of eachnet 's site used to be done this way , so things are improving .
" trust is the fundamental issue that we face , " says eachnet 's mr fagan , whose firm is allied to us online auctioneer ebay .
building trust and it is not just sellers who are wary .
liu hong , a fashion-loving government official from western china who browses the web for hints on clothes and make-up , told bbc news online her acquaintances remained suspicious of shopping online .
" they were even suspecting mail order , " she says .
web firms globally are trying to jump this hurdle .
in china , many shoppers still remember the early days of market reform when ruthless peddlers conned people into parting with their savings for what often turned out to be a box of bricks , or sawdust .
liu hong is willing to give e-commerce a try , but has another problem .
" i 've visited online shops but i did n't use them because i did n't have a credit card , " she says .
only about 20 million chinese have credit cards out of a total population of 1.3 billion , says duncan clark , an ex-investment banker who runs bda china , an it analysis firm based in beijing .
banking hurdles getting a card depends on having a well-paid friend who can guarantee repayment .
but even those who do have credit or debit cards may be unable to use them far beyond their home town .
in china , credit and debit cards are individually issued by different banks with little or no co-ordination .
" if you have a debit card issued in beijing and you have a shanghai account , it does n't work , " says mr fagan .
online merchants like eachnet have to spend hours setting up payment systems with different banks , often placing a pool of money in hand .
effective e-commerce also requires national credit card clearance , mr dewoskin points out , especially since profits in the sector tend to depend on high volumes and low margins .
chinese financial regulators are trying to solve the problem but " there 's a lot of talk and not a lot of action , " in mr fagan 's view .
as china 's currency is not internationally convertible , buying goods abroad remains a cumbersome process by any method .
what 's more , china 's foreign exchange counters do not accept invoices from online transactions .
manufacturing powerhouse american corporate visions of millions of chinese consumers buying goods across international borders remain a dream .
a minority of privileged chinese who have worked abroad and have us dollar bank accounts and credit cards can readily shop online from the likes of amazon.com , but most buyers are ex-pats .
analysts see much greater hope for online trading to take off in the business to business -lrb- b2b -rrb- sector .
rather than china 's huge population buying foreign goods online , it seems the boom may come from foreign firms purchasing made-in-china goods to sell back home .
edward zeng is the founder of sparkice , which sources everything from traditional ladies fans to footballs , hiking clothes and office supplies from a database of chinese manufacturers .

in july , sparkice says , it found suppliers for more than $ 1m of office equipment for a us firm in just two hours .

two families explain why they have turned their backs on long working hours to reclaim their lives .
-lrb- identity is retained in order to protect them against damaging future career prospects -rrb- .
cliff was a successful marketing director working long hours in the city .
he wanted to be a millionaire by the time he got to his early forties .
but when he became a father he suddenly realised that if he carried on with his career ambitions he might miss an important part of his son 's life .
at the moment i 'm just enjoying family life cliff " until recently money and commercial success were the only things i was really interested in , " he says .
he worked five days a week for 10 or 11 hours each day with no lunch break .
sometimes he worked until 10.30 at night .
at one point he lived so far away from his office that his journey into work was taking up to three hours .
redundancy cushion cliff 's son was born just when his employers were cutting back staff and offering voluntary redundancy .
" i jumped at it , " he says .
but giving up work has also meant a sharp drop in earnings .
" between us we had a six-figure income .
we felt we never saw him and when we did his mind was still at work or he was exhausted executive 's wife " now we are living on my wife 's part-time salary .
our income is about a third of what it used to be . "
but the redundancy money also provided the couple with a cash cushion .
and although cliff intends to start doing some freelance work he has not had to think about earning immediately .
" at the moment i 'm just enjoying family life . "
conspicuous consumption a typical day now involves taking the baby swimming , having lunch and going for a long walk in the park .
cliff says he is certain that he made the right decision but that with hindsight he might have spent longer thinking the whole thing through .
" we would never have described ourselves as conspicuous consumption types .
" now i realise things like paying for holidays or buying a new car - funds have to be found somehow , " he says .
regaining family life cliff 's experiences are echoed by the wife of a former senior executive at a hi-tech firm .
she does not want her name used for fear of damaging her husband 's future career .

many of them came from refugees who carried them over the himalayas when they fled from the chinese invasion of tibet in the 1950s .
the collection includes works of buddhist philosophy , mathematics , alchemy and ancient exotica .
