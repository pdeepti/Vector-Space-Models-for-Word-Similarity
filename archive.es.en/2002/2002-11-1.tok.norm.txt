finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .
analysts say the fall is seasonal and in any case less pronounced than in previous years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for more civic involvement no instant cure for germany 's ailing economy www-links international monetary fund information on imf activities the german ministry for economics and labour in english radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.11.2002 where now for german wine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans know how good their wine is - the rest of us apparently do n't as german vintners announce an above average 2002 harvest , the german wine lobby is working to improve the beverage 's image abroad . there is no getting away from it .
next to the ‘ abc ’ -lrb- ‘ anything but chardonnay ’ -rrb- rule , bringing a bottle of liebfraumilch or blue nun to a dinner party is the equivalent of committing social suicid - german wine has a bad reputation .
but now plans are afoot to change all this .
the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .
“ black tower and liebfraumilch really aren ’ t that bad , you know , ” he said .
“ and i wouldn ’ t call them cheap ; more good-value . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second-rate grapes ?

falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .

now the company is opening shop in the u.k. but whilst lingerie and sex toys are on hand , x-rated videos are n't . for half a century , beate uhse ran an erotica empire that became synonymous with sex in germany . movie theatres , a mail-order business and stores selling everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms are to be found from the company 's northern base in flensburg to the southern-most tip of bavaria . ninety-eight percent of germans know about uhse , who died in 2001 just two years after the company went public on the german stock exchange . this week , the beate uhse group opened its first store in the u.k. and with it its entry into the english-speaking world .
in the coming years , it seems , europe 's sex sellers may be ready to take on the american giants at hustler and playboy . 200 stores across europe the store in sutton - deep in london 's suburbia - is not what beate uhse followers are used to , however .
many of the 200 beate uhse stores in nine european countries have covered windows and video booths and 90 percent of sales at beate uhse stores have traditionally been to men . but earlier this year , a new generation of managers set out to change that .
norway was the testing ground for a new concept – a brighter , more inviting atmosphere that features lingerie near the front of the store and sex toys at the back .
sex videos , which account for 40 percent of sales in traditional stores , are nowhere to be found . the result ?
nine out of 10 customers in the four stores opened in norway this year are women , according to a company press release . and beate uhse executives are expecting more of the same in britain .
" i 'd be surprised if the women of sutton do n't wear lingerie from our store , " michael vaughan , the u.k. manager told the guardian . " good potential here " company chief financial officer otto lindemann added : " trading in erotic products has by no means been exhausted in great britain .
we see a good potential here . " in the next several years , beate uhse plans to open about 100 new stores aimed at women shoppers .
to accommodate this growth , the company is planning a new distribution and logistics center in amsterdam and is expanding its hungarian factory operation where rubber and latex products are produced .
also planned is an expansion of its mail-order business into the united states . with an expected 250 million euros in sales expected this year , the company has come a long way since its beginning shortly after the end of world war ii . village beginnings in a 1998 interview with the chicago tribune , uhse recalled village life in the months following the war when the men slowly began returning home .
" the joy was overwhelming , and after three months a baby was on the way , " uhse said . indeed , uhse started out by providing information on birth control to women in her native village .
" the pill was not yet invented , and condoms were not to be had .
women came and said , ' beate , what could we do ? ' " uhse , whose mother was one of the first women doctors in germany , went to the library to research methods of natural birth control and then wrote up a small brochure based on what she learned .
at first she copied the brochure by hand , but eventually she found a printer who printed it in exchange for five pounds of butter . uhse sold 32,000 copies in the first year .
and a business was born . uhse offered this advice about sex : " it 's important that both have basically the same desires about life .
not only about sexuality .
sexuality is very , very important , but if you do n't have the same ideas about life and if you quarrel about should we take our holiday on the beach or should we take it in the alps , the best sexuality dies .

next to the ‘ abc ’ -lrb- ‘ anything but chardonnay ’ -rrb- rule , bringing a bottle of liebfraumilch or blue nun to a dinner party is the equivalent of committing social suicid - german wine has a bad reputation .
but now plans are afoot to change all this .
the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .

the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .
“ black tower and liebfraumilch really aren ’ t that bad , you know , ” he said .
“ and i wouldn ’ t call them cheap ; more good-value . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second-rate grapes ?

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .

the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .

next to the ‘ abc ’ -lrb- ‘ anything but chardonnay ’ -rrb- rule , bringing a bottle of liebfraumilch or blue nun to a dinner party is the equivalent of committing social suicid - german wine has a bad reputation .
but now plans are afoot to change all this .
the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .

now the company is opening shop in the u.k. but whilst lingerie and sex toys are on hand , x-rated videos are n't . for half a century , beate uhse ran an erotica empire that became synonymous with sex in germany . movie theatres , a mail-order business and stores selling everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms are to be found from the company 's northern base in flensburg to the southern-most tip of bavaria . ninety-eight percent of germans know about uhse , who died in 2001 just two years after the company went public on the german stock exchange . this week , the beate uhse group opened its first store in the u.k. and with it its entry into the english-speaking world .
in the coming years , it seems , europe 's sex sellers may be ready to take on the american giants at hustler and playboy . 200 stores across europe the store in sutton - deep in london 's suburbia - is not what beate uhse followers are used to , however .
many of the 200 beate uhse stores in nine european countries have covered windows and video booths and 90 percent of sales at beate uhse stores have traditionally been to men . but earlier this year , a new generation of managers set out to change that .
norway was the testing ground for a new concept – a brighter , more inviting atmosphere that features lingerie near the front of the store and sex toys at the back .
sex videos , which account for 40 percent of sales in traditional stores , are nowhere to be found . the result ?
nine out of 10 customers in the four stores opened in norway this year are women , according to a company press release . and beate uhse executives are expecting more of the same in britain .
" i 'd be surprised if the women of sutton do n't wear lingerie from our store , " michael vaughan , the u.k. manager told the guardian . " good potential here " company chief financial officer otto lindemann added : " trading in erotic products has by no means been exhausted in great britain .
we see a good potential here . " in the next several years , beate uhse plans to open about 100 new stores aimed at women shoppers .
to accommodate this growth , the company is planning a new distribution and logistics center in amsterdam and is expanding its hungarian factory operation where rubber and latex products are produced .
also planned is an expansion of its mail-order business into the united states . with an expected 250 million euros in sales expected this year , the company has come a long way since its beginning shortly after the end of world war ii . village beginnings in a 1998 interview with the chicago tribune , uhse recalled village life in the months following the war when the men slowly began returning home .
" the joy was overwhelming , and after three months a baby was on the way , " uhse said . indeed , uhse started out by providing information on birth control to women in her native village .
" the pill was not yet invented , and condoms were not to be had .
women came and said , ' beate , what could we do ? ' " uhse , whose mother was one of the first women doctors in germany , went to the library to research methods of natural birth control and then wrote up a small brochure based on what she learned .
at first she copied the brochure by hand , but eventually she found a printer who printed it in exchange for five pounds of butter . uhse sold 32,000 copies in the first year .
and a business was born . uhse offered this advice about sex : " it 's important that both have basically the same desires about life .
not only about sexuality .
sexuality is very , very important , but if you do n't have the same ideas about life and if you quarrel about should we take our holiday on the beach or should we take it in the alps , the best sexuality dies .

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .

next to the ‘ abc ’ -lrb- ‘ anything but chardonnay ’ -rrb- rule , bringing a bottle of liebfraumilch or blue nun to a dinner party is the equivalent of committing social suicid - german wine has a bad reputation .
but now plans are afoot to change all this .
the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .
“ black tower and liebfraumilch really aren ’ t that bad , you know , ” he said .
“ and i wouldn ’ t call them cheap ; more good-value . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second-rate grapes ?

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .
analysts say the fall is seasonal and in any case less pronounced than in previous years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for more civic involvement no instant cure for germany 's ailing economy www-links international monetary fund information on imf activities the german ministry for economics and labour in english 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .
analysts say the fall is seasonal and in any case less pronounced than in previous years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for more civic involvement no instant cure for germany 's ailing economy www-links international monetary fund information on imf activities the german ministry for economics and labour in english 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but now plans are afoot to change all this .
the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .

a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .
“ black tower and liebfraumilch really aren ’ t that bad , you know , ” he said .

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .
analysts say the fall is seasonal and in any case less pronounced than in previous years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for more civic involvement no instant cure for germany 's ailing economy www-links international monetary fund information on imf activities the german ministry for economics and labour in english 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .

now the company is opening shop in the u.k. but whilst lingerie and sex toys are on hand , x-rated videos are n't . for half a century , beate uhse ran an erotica empire that became synonymous with sex in germany . movie theatres , a mail-order business and stores selling everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms are to be found from the company 's northern base in flensburg to the southern-most tip of bavaria . ninety-eight percent of germans know about uhse , who died in 2001 just two years after the company went public on the german stock exchange . this week , the beate uhse group opened its first store in the u.k. and with it its entry into the english-speaking world .
in the coming years , it seems , europe 's sex sellers may be ready to take on the american giants at hustler and playboy . 200 stores across europe the store in sutton - deep in london 's suburbia - is not what beate uhse followers are used to , however .
many of the 200 beate uhse stores in nine european countries have covered windows and video booths and 90 percent of sales at beate uhse stores have traditionally been to men . but earlier this year , a new generation of managers set out to change that .
norway was the testing ground for a new concept – a brighter , more inviting atmosphere that features lingerie near the front of the store and sex toys at the back .
sex videos , which account for 40 percent of sales in traditional stores , are nowhere to be found . the result ?
nine out of 10 customers in the four stores opened in norway this year are women , according to a company press release . and beate uhse executives are expecting more of the same in britain .
" i 'd be surprised if the women of sutton do n't wear lingerie from our store , " michael vaughan , the u.k. manager told the guardian . " good potential here " company chief financial officer otto lindemann added : " trading in erotic products has by no means been exhausted in great britain .
we see a good potential here . " in the next several years , beate uhse plans to open about 100 new stores aimed at women shoppers .
to accommodate this growth , the company is planning a new distribution and logistics center in amsterdam and is expanding its hungarian factory operation where rubber and latex products are produced .
also planned is an expansion of its mail-order business into the united states . with an expected 250 million euros in sales expected this year , the company has come a long way since its beginning shortly after the end of world war ii . village beginnings in a 1998 interview with the chicago tribune , uhse recalled village life in the months following the war when the men slowly began returning home .
" the joy was overwhelming , and after three months a baby was on the way , " uhse said . indeed , uhse started out by providing information on birth control to women in her native village .
" the pill was not yet invented , and condoms were not to be had .
women came and said , ' beate , what could we do ? ' " uhse , whose mother was one of the first women doctors in germany , went to the library to research methods of natural birth control and then wrote up a small brochure based on what she learned .
at first she copied the brochure by hand , but eventually she found a printer who printed it in exchange for five pounds of butter . uhse sold 32,000 copies in the first year .
and a business was born . uhse offered this advice about sex : " it 's important that both have basically the same desires about life .
not only about sexuality .
sexuality is very , very important , but if you do n't have the same ideas about life and if you quarrel about should we take our holiday on the beach or should we take it in the alps , the best sexuality dies .

next to the ‘ abc ’ -lrb- ‘ anything but chardonnay ’ -rrb- rule , bringing a bottle of liebfraumilch or blue nun to a dinner party is the equivalent of committing social suicid - german wine has a bad reputation .
but now plans are afoot to change all this .
the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .
“ black tower and liebfraumilch really aren ’ t that bad , you know , ” he said .
“ and i wouldn ’ t call them cheap ; more good-value . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second-rate grapes ?

the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .

in the coming years , it seems , europe 's sex sellers may be ready to take on the american giants at hustler and playboy . 200 stores across europe the store in sutton - deep in london 's suburbia - is not what beate uhse followers are used to , however .
many of the 200 beate uhse stores in nine european countries have covered windows and video booths and 90 percent of sales at beate uhse stores have traditionally been to men . but earlier this year , a new generation of managers set out to change that .

nine out of 10 customers in the four stores opened in norway this year are women , according to a company press release . and beate uhse executives are expecting more of the same in britain .

" the joy was overwhelming , and after three months a baby was on the way , " uhse said . indeed , uhse started out by providing information on birth control to women in her native village .
" the pill was not yet invented , and condoms were not to be had .
women came and said , ' beate , what could we do ? ' " uhse , whose mother was one of the first women doctors in germany , went to the library to research methods of natural birth control and then wrote up a small brochure based on what she learned .
at first she copied the brochure by hand , but eventually she found a printer who printed it in exchange for five pounds of butter . uhse sold 32,000 copies in the first year .
and a business was born . uhse offered this advice about sex : " it 's important that both have basically the same desires about life .
not only about sexuality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.11.2002 where now for german wine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans know how good their wine is - the rest of us apparently do n't as german vintners announce an above average 2002 harvest , the german wine lobby is working to improve the beverage 's image abroad . there is no getting away from it .
next to the ‘ abc ’ -lrb- ‘ anything but chardonnay ’ -rrb- rule , bringing a bottle of liebfraumilch or blue nun to a dinner party is the equivalent of committing social suicid - german wine has a bad reputation .
but now plans are afoot to change all this .
the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .
“ black tower and liebfraumilch really aren ’ t that bad , you know , ” he said .
“ and i wouldn ’ t call them cheap ; more good-value . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second-rate grapes ?

now the company is opening shop in the u.k. but whilst lingerie and sex toys are on hand , x-rated videos are n't . for half a century , beate uhse ran an erotica empire that became synonymous with sex in germany . movie theatres , a mail-order business and stores selling everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms are to be found from the company 's northern base in flensburg to the southern-most tip of bavaria . ninety-eight percent of germans know about uhse , who died in 2001 just two years after the company went public on the german stock exchange . this week , the beate uhse group opened its first store in the u.k. and with it its entry into the english-speaking world .
in the coming years , it seems , europe 's sex sellers may be ready to take on the american giants at hustler and playboy . 200 stores across europe the store in sutton - deep in london 's suburbia - is not what beate uhse followers are used to , however .
many of the 200 beate uhse stores in nine european countries have covered windows and video booths and 90 percent of sales at beate uhse stores have traditionally been to men . but earlier this year , a new generation of managers set out to change that .
norway was the testing ground for a new concept – a brighter , more inviting atmosphere that features lingerie near the front of the store and sex toys at the back .
sex videos , which account for 40 percent of sales in traditional stores , are nowhere to be found . the result ?
nine out of 10 customers in the four stores opened in norway this year are women , according to a company press release . and beate uhse executives are expecting more of the same in britain .
" i 'd be surprised if the women of sutton do n't wear lingerie from our store , " michael vaughan , the u.k. manager told the guardian . " good potential here " company chief financial officer otto lindemann added : " trading in erotic products has by no means been exhausted in great britain .
we see a good potential here . " in the next several years , beate uhse plans to open about 100 new stores aimed at women shoppers .
to accommodate this growth , the company is planning a new distribution and logistics center in amsterdam and is expanding its hungarian factory operation where rubber and latex products are produced .
also planned is an expansion of its mail-order business into the united states . with an expected 250 million euros in sales expected this year , the company has come a long way since its beginning shortly after the end of world war ii . village beginnings in a 1998 interview with the chicago tribune , uhse recalled village life in the months following the war when the men slowly began returning home .
" the joy was overwhelming , and after three months a baby was on the way , " uhse said . indeed , uhse started out by providing information on birth control to women in her native village .
" the pill was not yet invented , and condoms were not to be had .
women came and said , ' beate , what could we do ? ' " uhse , whose mother was one of the first women doctors in germany , went to the library to research methods of natural birth control and then wrote up a small brochure based on what she learned .
at first she copied the brochure by hand , but eventually she found a printer who printed it in exchange for five pounds of butter . uhse sold 32,000 copies in the first year .
and a business was born . uhse offered this advice about sex : " it 's important that both have basically the same desires about life .
not only about sexuality .
sexuality is very , very important , but if you do n't have the same ideas about life and if you quarrel about should we take our holiday on the beach or should we take it in the alps , the best sexuality dies .

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .
analysts say the fall is seasonal and in any case less pronounced than in previous years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for more civic involvement no instant cure for germany 's ailing economy www-links international monetary fund information on imf activities the german ministry for economics and labour in english 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but now plans are afoot to change all this .
the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .
analysts say the fall is seasonal and in any case less pronounced than in previous years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for more civic involvement no instant cure for germany 's ailing economy www-links international monetary fund information on imf activities the german ministry for economics and labour in english 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .
analysts say the fall is seasonal and in any case less pronounced than in previous years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for more civic involvement no instant cure for germany 's ailing economy www-links international monetary fund information on imf activities the german ministry for economics and labour in english 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but now plans are afoot to change all this .
the “ deutschweinvision 2020 ” is an attempt by the german wine industry to develop an all-encompassing long-term strategy to improve prices for wine growers at home and better the image of german wines abroad . although it is still a work in progress , the first results and recommendations are expected by the end of the year . small vintners can ’ t cover costs the strategy has been necessitated by severe problems currently facing traditional wine growers in germany .
many , mostly smaller , vintners who make wine in traditional wooden barrels are not able to demand prices for their product which enables them to cover production costs . as a result , larger , more commercially viable producers are overtaking the smaller wine makers .
rudolph nickenig , spokesperson for the german wine association -lrb- vdw -rrb- told dw-world the problem of low prices was “ threatening the very existence of small wine growers who produce top quality german wines . ” indeed , the number of smaller vintners has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years .
according to a government report published this month , germany had 50,000 producers in 1979 .
by 1999 , the figure had fallen to 34,440 .
german wine - “ it used to be more ” “ germans used to drink a higher percentage of domestically-produced wine , of course , ” nickenig told dw-world .
although germans now drink more wine than beer – downing a whopping 24 litres per head each year - only 45 % of this is german wine .
the remaining 55 % hails from the vineyards of italy , spain , france and chile among others . “ german wine drinkers tend to be quite adventurous – they ’ re very curious of what ’ s happening in new world wines for example .
that ’ s why there is such a market at the moment for foreign wines , " he said . german wines have long faced a bad rap abroad , often regarded as overly sweet .
the german wine black tower was recently re-launched in the uk to great irony in the british press ; they found the attempt to re-brand the wine nothing if not rather amusing . nickenig wants a chance to change this image of the 2.4 million litres of german wine exported each year . “ of course some german wines are sweet , but many are very dry as well .
due to the climate , our grapes produce wines which have very fruity aromas in the main , ” he said . good year for german wine , a " good-value " the warm spring in germany this year as well as a summer which lasted right into the end of september has meant vines have had longer than usual to ripen .
the harvest has been better than the average annual yield of 10 million hectare litres according to wine experts . “ i ’ m always very sceptical about it when producers start talking about ‘ good years ’ , ” nickenig told dw-world , “ but the good weather has meant the grapes have a high sugar content and that basically means they ’ ll make good wine . ”
a good year for wine and better lobbying for producers might well be the mix that will save germany ’ s wine growers from extinction , although changing clichés about certain german wines might well prove more of a challenge . on that subject joachim basler wanted to make one thing clear .

finance minister hans eichel and economy and labour minister wolfgang clement have to save more .
falling in line with new imf projections released thursday , the german government has been forced to revise its growth predictions downwards .
but experts warn that austerity measures could hamper economic recovery . the german government announced its economy now not expected to grow as much as previously predicted on thursday - the same day that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also cut its growth forecast for germany .
the final figure for economic expansion in 2002 is now expected be just 0.5 % this year , down a third from the previous estimate of 0.75 % .
it has also revised the estimate for 2003 downwards from 2.5 % to 1.5 % .
in its annual review of the german economy , the imf 's left its growth forecast for 2002 unchanged at 0.5 % , but cut the 2003 forecast from 2 % to 1.75 % .
" in 2003 , gdp growth is expected to pick up , but is likely to remain weaker than previously projected and subject to considerable risks , " the imf said .
" these include global uncertainties and a complex set of domestic factors . "
but the reformed expectations coming out of " super-minister " wolfgang clement 's new economics and labour ministry did not come as much of a surprise .
the eurozone 's largest economy has not really managed to recover from last year 's mild recession , and gross domestic product only grew at 0.3 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year .
a climate of pessimism the ministry 's forecast assumes growth is now picking up and will continue to do so in 2003 .
however , germany 's key ifo business climate index registered a decline for the fifth consecutive time this month , and the six leading economics institutes have also lowered their 2002 growth forecasts from 0.9 to 0.4 per cent .
their estimate for next year is also similar to the government 's latest forecast .
the cure could be worse than the illness one of the biggest problems is likely to be caused by the german government 's struggle to balance its budget .
germany has already admitted that its deficit for this year will exceed the 3 % of gdp limit laid down in eu 's stability and growth pact .
the imf said it expected a german budget deficit of 3.5 % this year and warned that attempts to redress it too quickly could damage economic recovery .
outlining the new government 's programme on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a range of measures aimed at increasing tax revenues and cutting expenditure .
these include cuts in state subsidies for people building their own homes and a tax on investment .
" the cuts and savings agreed by the coalition are balanced , " schröder said .
" they all have the sole aim of creating new scope for future investment and through it growth and employment . "
but many economists believe the government 's plans could further depress consumer spending and thereby fuel a recession .
big banks post losses more bad news from the banking sector this week seemed to support that view .
deutsche bank on thursday posted an unexpected third quarter loss of more than 180 million euros .
but an executive at europe 's largest bank said bankruptcies in germany were only part of the reason .
" our german loan book is not the problem , " he said .
analysts said that much of the drop was caused by increased loss provisions to cover liabilities from foreign clients such as the failed us telecommunications group worldcom and british communications firm , marconi .
last week , deutsche bank 's biggest competitor , the hvb group , also reported record losses for the third quarter .
even the news that germany 's jobless total dropped by as many as 30,000 in october is unlikely to lift the gloom .

chunghwa picture tubes -lrb- cpt -rrb- said the vast majority of the workforce at its plant at mossend , in north lanarkshire , will be made redundant .
the company came to scotland promising to create more than 3,000 jobs but at its peak the plant , which makes cathode tubes for computer monitors and televisions , employed 1,200 .
now only about 40 or 50 of its 639-strong workforce will be retained at the huge site .
scottish enterprise minister iain gray said his first concern was the workforce but added : " i am extremely disappointed that despite substantial subsidies from the public purse made over many years , cpt have announced these jobs losses .
" however , the issue of the financial assistance can not be overlooked .
" as well as being exempt from rate payments for the past eight years , the company has received some £ 15m in regional selective assistance payments .
" in light of today 's announcement i have instructed my officials to pursue clawing back some of that money . "
chunghwa said it had invested more than £ 205m in the plant over six years and blamed the downturn in the global economic market .
a spokesman said : " we have been operating in an extremely tough business environment in recent years - none more so than in the last few months .
' financial difficulty ' " the strength of the pound , coupled with the downturn in the global market and the economic aftermath of september 11 , have led to cpt 's reluctant proposal to reduce staff numbers from 639 to between 40 and 50 on february 4 , 2003 .
" the company is committed to ensuring staff members are equipped with all the resources and support they need to secure other jobs or retraining . "
bernie hamilton , regional officer with the amicus-aeeu union , said : " the company has been in financial difficulty for some time now , but this announcement is completely unexpected .
" initial discussions have taken place with the company and we are seeking further talks as a matter of urgency .
" this is another product of the flawed inward investment policy of the late 80s and early 90s impacting on the hard-working people of scotland . "
scottish national party economy spokesman andrew wilson said questions must be asked about the financial tactics used to entice multinational companies .
he said : " it is now clear that a phenomenal amount of taxpayers ' money has been badly squandered .
" and serious questions must be asked about the competence of government ministers who agreed to deals that lined the pockets of multinationals without protecting the long-term interests of the scottish taxpayer , workers and the economy . "
compaq merger the announcement was a further blow for scotland 's once-buoyant electronics sector , known as silicon glen .
about 600 workers at inventec 's plants in hillington , glasgow and inchinnan , renfrewshire , lost their jobs in july .
hewlett-packard cut 650 jobs at its plant in erskine , renfrewshire , following the merger with compaq .
mobile phone firm motorola made more than 3,000 members of its workforce redundant when it closed its factory at bathgate , west lothian last year .

the plan is the first response from the banking sector to the government 's package of measures to address deflation and the bad debts crippling the country 's economy . , the bank has lent 2 trillion yen -lrb- $ 16.4bn ; £ 10.5bn -rrb- to 150 companies which are " near to failure " or have already collapsed , according to the asahi shimbun newspaper .
the report said the bank would try to write off up to 80 % of the loans from next april .
the government 's own deadline is 2005 .
short on specifics the newspaper said the bank had originally planned to take longer but that the government 's plan had encouraged it to speed up the programme .
observers say a similar acceleration is under way at japan 's other banks .
mizuho itself would not confirm the report , saying only that it was working in line with the overall government plan .
the measures , announced by the economics minister heizo takenaka on wednesday , involve a phasing out of tax breaks and a massive tax cut .
more pain to come ?
mizuho 's acceleration plans still leave trillions of debts unaccounted for .
even at the government 's estimate , the banks are groaning under 52 trillion yen in loans secured against real estate and shares which are now worth a fraction of their original value .
the only thing keeping many of the indebted companies viable is the fact that japan 's interest rate is effectively zero .
and many unofficial estimates of the scale of the problem set the overall debt burden at three or four times the government 's figure .
