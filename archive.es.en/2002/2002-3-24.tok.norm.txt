day three : the 0400 starts have finally claimed their first victim .
one unfortunate member of the travelling press missed the flight from mexico to peru .
no , she did n't get the day off , she had to follow on in what someone described as an equipment plane , whatever that is .
sitting on the normal plane , i used the flight unwisely .
although i knew i should have slept i could n't resist looking at the in-flight entertainment schedule , and ended up watching two and a half films over the five and a half hour flight .
i say " unwisely " but there was something satisfyingly bizarre about watching moulin rouge as the plane bounced across the choppy air of the equator .
dramatic landing the approach into lima was worth the bouncing .
peru 's red carpet was pressed into service nestled between the towering andes mountains and the pacific ocean there are few more dramatic places to land .
crawling up the barren mountains are the many shanty towns that surround the city and where the poverty is striking .
i wondered whether president bush had noticed them too and whether if he had he thought the un development conference he had just left would do them much good .
red carpet a-plenty this was of course the first ever visit by a sitting us president to peru .
vice-president richard nixon had been here in the 1950s but given what happened to him , it was not a landmark anyone seemed keen to talk about .
it was not perhaps surprising then that the peruvian government gave mr bush a very warm welcome .
it looked as if the country 's entire supply of red carpet had been used up , laid out in strategic parts of the city .
spot the change the whole purpose of the president 's visit was to show us support for peru 's transition from ex-president alberto fujimori 's authoritarianism to current president alejandro toledo 's democracy .
but it was a tricky transition to spot .
that was not president 's toledo 's fault as such but rather due to the threat of another terrorist attack , following last wednesday 's car bomb , which caused the government to deploy its military and police in generous numbers just in case .
' good friends ' at their joint news conference , project bolster toledo was in full swing .
the presidents ' wives got the red carpet treatment too president bush , who loves to describe fellow leaders as " my good friend " , was good-friending president toledo for all he was worth .
he joked the two men were the same age but noted how mr toledo 's hair was still black .
referring to the peruvian leader 's amerindian heritage and his impoverished upbringing and ultimate rise to power , the us president said : " i 'm inspired by his life , i 'm inspired by his story " .
at the end of it all , one watching journalist said they had done everything but kiss each other .
taxing symbolism all in all though it was a taxing day for the white house press pack .
the problem with such visits as this which are high on symbolism and short on substance is that they do not lend themselves to the kind of reporting that journalists like best : lots of action , a few facts and a bit of drama .
that may explain why a colleague switched one of the filing centre 's tvs from a local channel covering " bush la visita " to a cable channel showing us college basketball to the appreciative cheers of the symbolically challenged press-pack .

speaking at a joint press conference with peruvian president alejandro toledo in the capital lima , mr bush said that the two nations shared a common perspective on the problem : " we must stop it " .
according to the bbc 's peter greste , the meeting was more about symbolism than substance . "
peruvians have been reminded again this week of the terrible human toll of terror " president bush our correspondent said there were few hard-nosed initiatives , but the fact the two presidents stood side-by-side with each other agreeing to fight terrorism was the major aim of the meeting .
mr bush also paid tribute to the progress of peru 's political institutions since his host came to power in succession to alberto fujimori .
historic visit president bush arrived in the country on saturday for talks on regional security , trade and ways to curb drug trafficking .
it is the first visit to peru by a serving us president .
only days before mr bush 's arrival , a car bomb killed nine people near the us embassy in lima .
" peruvians have been reminded again this week of the terrible human toll of terror , " mr bush said , offering his sympathies to the victims .
after his meeting with the peruvian president , mr bush met with other andean leaders before setting off for el salvador and the next leg of his tour .
the presidents of bolivia and colombia and the vice-president of ecuador attended the talks - at which discussions centred on a free-trade pact to open us markets to certain andean goods .
the pact eliminates tariffs on some andean exports in return for action in combatting drug trafficking .
the region 's leaders told mr bush that the andean trade preferences act has been a boon for their economies .
the act expired last year and mr bush said he would be pressing for the renewal to be pushed forward through the senate .
peace corp the president also used his presence in peru to announce a return of the us peace corps to the country after a 27-year absence .
the peace corps is an agency that sends american volunteers to help communities outside the us .
" the first volunteers will arrive in august , a symbol of the stronger ties between our people and the stronger relationship between our nations , " mr bush said .
he also promised increased us aid to support peru 's efforts in stemming a possible resurgence in coca production and heroin poppy crops in remote highland areas .
but no decision was reached on whether to resume drug surveillance flights over peru - which were suspended after a peruvian military jet shot down a plane carrying an american missionary family .
warm welcome on president bush 's arrival in lima , he was greeted by trumpeted national anthems , an honour guard and a red carpet as he was met by the peruvian president alejandro toledo at a military base near lima .
but there was also heightened security following the bomb blast at the us embassy .
no-one has claimed responsibility for wednesday 's explosion and the imprisoned leaders of the country 's main rebel groups have denied involvement .

by the bbc 's james silver with 1500 front page pictures in the british tabloids to his name - and many thousands more around the world - jason fraser remains the crown prince of celebrity snappers .
recent scoops included big brother presenter davina mccall water-skiing in mauritius , and former eastenders star daniella westbrook on honeymoon in florida , where she was also celebrating the end of a drugs-free year . "
a huge number of the ... celebrities ... how can i put this ? ... are n't exactly surprised when the pictures appear in the newspapers " " jason fraser these are just the kind of feel-good celebrity " unposed portraits " that have become his stock-in-trade .
whether hanging out of a helicopter , clambering through the undergrowth or merely invited along for the ride , fraser specialises in getting the pictures other photographers ca n't get .
in the words of sunday express editor martin townsend , he captures " an intimate , inside view of stars caught off guard " .
stars tip-off photographers ?
but as fraser reveals to bbc radio 's five live report , in reality very few of his subjects are " off guard " at all .
" in a huge number of the photographs i take , " he says , " the celebrities ... how can i put this ... are n't exactly surprised when the pictures appear in the newspapers afterwards . "
fraser , who began his career as a news photographer and had covers of time and newsweek magazines while still in his teens , says that " friends of the stars " or sometimes even the celebrities themselves , keep him informed about their whereabouts .
over a twenty year career , he says he 's received " tip-offs " from personalities ranging from princess diana to posh spice .
" for example , i got the geri halliwell robbie williams shots in the south of france before anyone else knew they were even together , " he says .
" i was tipped off about them , although i ca n't say by whom otherwise they 'll never do it again . "
so what 's in it for the celebrities ?
" they want to see their pictures in the newspapers , " fraser explains .
" if you pose for a picture it will end up on an inside page .
if you let you hair down by a pool or on a beach , those pictures are going to be a lot sexier and run near or at the front . "
invasion of privacy ?
but not all celebrities play the game .
radio 1 breakfast show host sara cox is suing the sunday people for publishing nude pictures of herself and her husband on honeymoon in the seychelles which she says were taken without her consent on a private property .
people editor neil wallis claims he " misunderstood the circumstances in which the pictures were taken " .
that 's hotly disputed by fraser who was behind the shots - he asserts that wallis was privy to all the details .
diana and dodi pictures fraser , 35 , is best known for the diana and dodi fayed " kiss picture " which is estimated to have netted him Â£ 250,000 .
" i was given information that she was seeing dodi and that they were in the med .
i did n't know exactly where , but i was told the name of the boat .

by the bbc 's james silver with 1500 front page pictures in the british tabloids to his name - and many thousands more around the world - jason fraser remains the crown prince of celebrity snappers .
recent scoops included big brother presenter davina mccall water-skiing in mauritius , and former eastenders star daniella westbrook on honeymoon in florida , where she was also celebrating the end of a drugs-free year .
a huge number of the ... celebrities ... how can i put this ? ... are n't exactly surprised when the pictures appear in the newspapers " jason fraser these are just the kind of feel-good celebrity " unposed portraits " that have become his stock-in-trade .
whether hanging out of a helicopter , clambering through the undergrowth or merely invited along for the ride , fraser specialises in getting the pictures other photographers ca n't get .
in the words of sunday express editor martin townsend , he captures " an intimate , inside view of stars caught off guard " .
stars tip-off photographers ?
but as fraser reveals to bbc radio 's five live report , in reality very few of his subjects are " off guard " at all .
" in a huge number of the photographs i take , " he says , " the celebrities ... how can i put this ... are n't exactly surprised when the pictures appear in the newspapers afterwards . "
fraser is best known for the diana and dodi " kiss picture " fraser , who began his career as a news photographer and had covers of time and newsweek magazines while still in his teens , says that " friends of the stars " or sometimes even the celebrities themselves , keep him informed about their whereabouts .
over a twenty year career , he says he 's received " tip-offs " from personalities ranging from princess diana to posh spice .
" for example , i got the geri halliwell robbie williams shots in the south of france before anyone else knew they were even together , " he says .
" i was tipped off about them , although i ca n't say by whom otherwise they 'll never do it again . "
so what 's in it for the celebrities ?
" they want to see their pictures in the newspapers , " fraser explains .
" if you pose for a picture it will end up on an inside page .
if you let you hair down by a pool or on a beach , those pictures are going to be a lot sexier and run near or at the front . "
invasion of privacy ?
sara cox is suing the sunday people but not all celebrities play the game .
radio 1 breakfast show host sara cox is suing the sunday people for publishing nude pictures of herself and her husband on honeymoon in the seychelles which she says were taken without her consent on a private property .
people editor neil wallis claims he " misunderstood the circumstances in which the pictures were taken " .
that 's hotly disputed by fraser who was behind the shots - he asserts that wallis was privy to all the details .
diana and dodi pictures fraser , 35 , is best known for the diana and dodi fayed " kiss picture " which is estimated to have netted him Â£ 250,000 .
" i was given information that she was seeing dodi and that they were in the med .
i did n't know exactly where , but i was told the name of the boat .
so i discussed it with -lsb- italian photographer -rsb- mario brenner who found it and got the photographs . "
sources close to fraser say that in the final frenzied weeks of her life , he spoke to diana nearly every day .
" after that i took over and photographed her in porto fino , sardinia and the south of france ... right up until paris .
i did n't go to paris .
but otherwise i was always there , wherever she went .
i was the person who revealed her relationship , i do n't know whether that feels good or not , but i will be remembered for it . "

the allegations were made in an undercover investigation by the sunday times in which a reporter posed as a wealthy banker trying to secure his son a place at pembroke college .
a senior college fellow is alleged to have agreed to create an extra place on a law degree course in return for a donation from him . "
there must be only one criteria for winning a place at oxford and that is individual excellence " dr colin lucas vice-chancellor pembroke college says a full , speedy and external inquiry will be held into the report .
vice-chancellor dr colin lucas said he was " appalled " by the allegations of " totally unacceptable behaviour " .
he added : " such action would contravene all the principals on which our admissions process is based .
" there must be only one criteria for winning a place at oxford and that is individual excellence . "
' secret trust ' he added : " if there 's any truth in these allegations , then the college ... must take the strongest measures to restore its good name and that of the university . "
the newspaper said that in a taped conversation , the senior college fellow could be heard allegedly revealing that it was not the first time a place had been granted in return for cash .
the paper says he allegedly advised paying the money through a secret trust to avoid leaks to the press .
the sunday times reports him as saying : " you must understand that this is absolutely confidential .
if this story gets out , we 'd all be blown away . "
he also allegedly told the fake banker that his son would have to get good grades such as two as and a b , and would have to be capable of getting at least a 2:1 degree in order for the application to be accepted .
admissions policy pembroke is known to be one of the poorest oxford colleges despite being one of the oldest .
despite this , master giles henderson said the college was committed to places being awarded on academic merit alone .
he added : " if found to be true , the actions and conduct described are deeply shocking and totally unacceptable . "
it is not the first time the university has been in the spotlight over its admissions policy .
three months ago trinity college turned down the son of wealthy banker philip keevil , despite his father giving Â£ 100,000 to the college , because he was not clever enough .
and it was stung by criticism of elitism by chancellor gordon brown when it rejected comprehensive school pupil laura spence , who was later accepted by american ivy league university harvard .

the lord of the rings : the fellowship of the ring holds the most nominations at 13 .
but pre-oscars awards ceremonies have indicated it could face tough competition for best picture and director .
in the best picture category , it takes on drama a beautiful mind , family drama in the bedroom , musical moulin rouge , and british class warfare tale gosford park .
sir ian mckellen : a star of the lord of the rings a beautiful mind had been tipped to take the coveted honour .
but recent controversy surrounding the movie has caused some commentators to question its chances .
the film about the schizophrenic nobel prize-winning mathematician john nash has been the target of negative stories .
many reports implied allegations that nash was anti-semitic and homosexual were left out of the film .
nash , director ron howard and the film 's makers universal have hit back at the accusations , adding that they thought a smear campaign from rival studios was behind the reports .
but the disquiet could open the door for the lord of the rings , or another nominee , to take best picture and see howard also lose out .
split howard won the directors guild of america award at the beginning of march .
since 1949 , when the directors guild of america first started handing out this award , the winner has gone on to win the best director at the academy awards on all but five occasions .
ron howard : won the dga award but , while statistics would appear to be on howard 's side , there is a school of thought in hollywood that the lord of the rings director peter jackson could sneak through to take the academy award .
such splitting of the top honours has happened before in years when academy members are reluctant to overwhelmingly back one particular movie .
boost however , an even bigger surprise could be on the horizon .
the screen actors guild 's -lrb- sag -rrb- top honour , for best ensemble cast , went to the period drama , gosford park .
the upstairs , downstairs-themed thriller beat off competition from the oscar front-runners , a beautiful mind and lord of the rings .
russell crowe : involved in a skirmish after the baftas and an additional boost for gosford park came in the category honouring a female actor in a supporting role .
the award went to british actress helen mirren for her portrayal of the housekeeper , mrs wilson .
when it comes to the oscars , mirren will face tough competition , in the equivalent category , from a beautiful mind star jennifer connelly , gosford park co-star maggie smith , kate winslet from iris and marisa tomei -lrb- in the bedroom -rrb- .
in the best actor category , russell crowe 's triumph , until recently considered in the bag , could also be jeopardy following his post- baftas skirmish in london .
crowe 's closest rival is thought to be denzel washington , who acts against type as a corrupt cop in training day .
deserving the best actress race is just as unsure .
many believe halle berry could win for monster 's ball after being named best female actor by the screen actors guild .
halle berry pipped favourite sissy spacek to the sag but in the bedroom star sissy spacek has also been consistently touted by most film critics as the most deserving for her role as a grieving mother .
in the supporting actor category there is further evidence that several performers have it all to play for .
