progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .
holland is a nation that welcomes immigrants .
despite the recent government efforts to make germany more attractive to highly skilled foreign workers and to offer immigrants inside germany better integration opportunities - including a faster naturalization process - the majority of germans do n't want more immigrants , a fact reconfirmed by poll after poll .
indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . the move effectively puts an end to any hopes entertained by viacom inc , aol time warner 's rival , of taking control of viva .
viacom 's channel , mtv , held a virtual monopoly over music television until viva entered the german market .
brent hansen , mtv 's europe chief , more or less conceded defeat in the battle with aol time warner for viva , speaking of a failure to " fulfill investment criteria and strategic aims " .
aol now owns a stake of 30.6 % in viva , above the level at which a full takeover bid becomes compulsory , under the german takeover code .
if it now takes over shares owned by vivendi universal , its stake will rise to 49.5 % .
vivendi faces a need to reduce its debt burden , so industry insiders believe it 's likely to be willing to sell .
for viva , a takeover by aol is likely to be the best way to secure its survival .
the market for music television is small , and it has been hit particularly hard by the decline in advertising revenue that has been felt across all media .
viva had feared that under the viacom umbrella , it would simply have been closed down .
meanwhile , for the recording companies , it is increasingly the case that music tv broadcasters are seen as purely an advertising platform for their products .
the music companies produce video clips at high cost , and they then give them up for free for broadcast on channels such as viva , onyx and mtv .
music-industry manager balthasar schramm , the new chief of sony music deutschland , has said it 's his medium-term goal to dismantle the independence of this kind of " intermediary between the clients and the music companies " , to enable the music companies to communicate directly with their clients .
apart from that , the music companies are hoping that there will increasingly be a market for their videos among web companies such as yahoo , which are willing to pay for content . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 23.06.02 © economy .

british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . the move effectively puts an end to any hopes entertained by viacom inc , aol time warner 's rival , of taking control of viva .
viacom 's channel , mtv , held a virtual monopoly over music television until viva entered the german market .
brent hansen , mtv 's europe chief , more or less conceded defeat in the battle with aol time warner for viva , speaking of a failure to " fulfill investment criteria and strategic aims " .
aol now owns a stake of 30.6 % in viva , above the level at which a full takeover bid becomes compulsory , under the german takeover code .
if it now takes over shares owned by vivendi universal , its stake will rise to 49.5 % .
vivendi faces a need to reduce its debt burden , so industry insiders believe it 's likely to be willing to sell .
for viva , a takeover by aol is likely to be the best way to secure its survival .
the market for music television is small , and it has been hit particularly hard by the decline in advertising revenue that has been felt across all media .
viva had feared that under the viacom umbrella , it would simply have been closed down .
meanwhile , for the recording companies , it is increasingly the case that music tv broadcasters are seen as purely an advertising platform for their products .
the music companies produce video clips at high cost , and they then give them up for free for broadcast on channels such as viva , onyx and mtv .
music-industry manager balthasar schramm , the new chief of sony music deutschland , has said it 's his medium-term goal to dismantle the independence of this kind of " intermediary between the clients and the music companies " , to enable the music companies to communicate directly with their clients .
apart from that , the music companies are hoping that there will increasingly be a market for their videos among web companies such as yahoo , which are willing to pay for content . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 23.06.02 © economy .

the mother says she would have had an abortion if she knew . germany 's federal supreme court is getting publicity it would rather do without right now .
one of its rulings has spurred a heated ethical debate in germany – and hardly anyone is siding with the judges .
the court ruled last week that a doctor has to pay financial support for a child that was born with severe physical disabilities .
the doctor had examined the child 's mother eleven times during her pregnancy , but failed to detect the handicap .
the doctor had misinterpreted an ultra-sound image taken in the 20th week of the pregnancy , in which the disability could already have been seen .
the parents sued the doctor because they said they would have aborted the child if they had known their son sebastian would be born with deformed arms and legs .
sebastian 's mother claimed that having a handicapped child made her depressive and even suicidal .
under german law , an abortion is legal if the pregnancy endangers the mother 's health .
this not only refers to health problems during the pregnancy but also afterwards .
in this case , the court judged that the mother 's depressive tendencies would have justified an abortion .
wider implications the verdict has wider implications for other parents of handicapped children in germany .
if they can prove that doctors overlooked the disability during pre-natal examinations , they can now also claim financial support .
all they have to do is say that they would have aborted the fetus , had they known that their child would be handicapped .
handicapped organizations shocked by verdict the supreme court ruling was met with sharp criticism from disabled organizations , politicians and the christian churches in germany .
netzwerk artikel 3 , a network of some 70 german organizations fighting for human rights and equality for disabled people , called the court ruling the " bursting of a dam . "
netzwerk- spokesman ottmar miles-paul said the self-help organizations were outraged that germany 's highest court considered a child born with multiple physical handicaps an unreasonable imposition to its parents .
" pre-natal selection is reality " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the ruling went against christian values .
the cardinal criticized german laws that he said make it possible to " sort out " disabled human beings and put " the decision about life or death of the unborn child " into the fickle hands of parents .
cologne 's cardinal , joachim meisner , said the karlsruhe-based court was no longer a good guardian of the country 's constitution .
he said the judges at germany 's highest court were n't using the law to protect the weakest members of society .
" sending the wrong signals " politicians from all of germany 's main political parties also expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict .
hermann kues , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said the verdict was sending the wrong signals .
ilja seifert , a member of germany 's post-communist party of democratic socialism said the court ruling could contribute to the stigmatization of handicapped people .
jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of germany 's federal physicians board criticized the verdict , saying it represented a stark contrast to the values of a humane society and violated the doctors ' code of ethics .
parents say " a victory for justice " the parents of the disabled child seem to be almost the only ones who are satisfied with the verdict .
sebastian 's father said he was " totally happy . "
he and his wife called the court ruling a " victory for justice . "
for them , a five year odyssey through german courts has finally come to an end . they began their legal quest for compensation immediately after their son 's birth .
sebastian is now five years old and about to enter school .
sebastian 's parents told germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that they had been forced to sue for compensation and damages so they could pay for their handicapped son 's special care .
sebastian needs custom-made gadgets that cater to his disability : a specially made bicycle , for instance , to give him more freedom of movement , and a computer that he can operate with his crippled arms .
but since sebastian 's mother had to give up her job to take care of her son and sebastian 's father is a blue-collar worker , they would n't have been able to afford any of these things otherwise .

the mother says she would have had an abortion if she knew . germany 's federal supreme court is getting publicity it would rather do without right now .
one of its rulings has spurred a heated ethical debate in germany – and hardly anyone is siding with the judges .
the court ruled last week that a doctor has to pay financial support for a child that was born with severe physical disabilities .
the doctor had examined the child 's mother eleven times during her pregnancy , but failed to detect the handicap .
the doctor had misinterpreted an ultra-sound image taken in the 20th week of the pregnancy , in which the disability could already have been seen .
the parents sued the doctor because they said they would have aborted the child if they had known their son sebastian would be born with deformed arms and legs .
sebastian 's mother claimed that having a handicapped child made her depressive and even suicidal .
under german law , an abortion is legal if the pregnancy endangers the mother 's health .
this not only refers to health problems during the pregnancy but also afterwards .
in this case , the court judged that the mother 's depressive tendencies would have justified an abortion .
wider implications the verdict has wider implications for other parents of handicapped children in germany .
if they can prove that doctors overlooked the disability during pre-natal examinations , they can now also claim financial support .
all they have to do is say that they would have aborted the fetus , had they known that their child would be handicapped .
handicapped organizations shocked by verdict the supreme court ruling was met with sharp criticism from disabled organizations , politicians and the christian churches in germany .
netzwerk artikel 3 , a network of some 70 german organizations fighting for human rights and equality for disabled people , called the court ruling the " bursting of a dam . "
netzwerk- spokesman ottmar miles-paul said the self-help organizations were outraged that germany 's highest court considered a child born with multiple physical handicaps an unreasonable imposition to its parents .
" pre-natal selection is reality " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the ruling went against christian values .
the cardinal criticized german laws that he said make it possible to " sort out " disabled human beings and put " the decision about life or death of the unborn child " into the fickle hands of parents .
cologne 's cardinal , joachim meisner , said the karlsruhe-based court was no longer a good guardian of the country 's constitution .
he said the judges at germany 's highest court were n't using the law to protect the weakest members of society .
" sending the wrong signals " politicians from all of germany 's main political parties also expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict .
hermann kues , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said the verdict was sending the wrong signals .
ilja seifert , a member of germany 's post-communist party of democratic socialism said the court ruling could contribute to the stigmatization of handicapped people .
jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of germany 's federal physicians board criticized the verdict , saying it represented a stark contrast to the values of a humane society and violated the doctors ' code of ethics .
parents say " a victory for justice " the parents of the disabled child seem to be almost the only ones who are satisfied with the verdict .
sebastian 's father said he was " totally happy . "
he and his wife called the court ruling a " victory for justice . "
for them , a five year odyssey through german courts has finally come to an end . they began their legal quest for compensation immediately after their son 's birth .
sebastian is now five years old and about to enter school .
sebastian 's parents told germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that they had been forced to sue for compensation and damages so they could pay for their handicapped son 's special care .
sebastian needs custom-made gadgets that cater to his disability : a specially made bicycle , for instance , to give him more freedom of movement , and a computer that he can operate with his crippled arms .
but since sebastian 's mother had to give up her job to take care of her son and sebastian 's father is a blue-collar worker , they would n't have been able to afford any of these things otherwise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.06.2002 integration : learning from holland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch policies bridge the gap between natives and immigrants immigration reformers in germany need look no further than their next-door neighbor .
progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .
holland is a nation that welcomes immigrants .
despite the recent government efforts to make germany more attractive to highly skilled foreign workers and to offer immigrants inside germany better integration opportunities - including a faster naturalization process - the majority of germans do n't want more immigrants , a fact reconfirmed by poll after poll .
indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

the mother says she would have had an abortion if she knew . germany 's federal supreme court is getting publicity it would rather do without right now .
one of its rulings has spurred a heated ethical debate in germany – and hardly anyone is siding with the judges .
the court ruled last week that a doctor has to pay financial support for a child that was born with severe physical disabilities .
the doctor had examined the child 's mother eleven times during her pregnancy , but failed to detect the handicap .
the doctor had misinterpreted an ultra-sound image taken in the 20th week of the pregnancy , in which the disability could already have been seen .
the parents sued the doctor because they said they would have aborted the child if they had known their son sebastian would be born with deformed arms and legs .
sebastian 's mother claimed that having a handicapped child made her depressive and even suicidal .
under german law , an abortion is legal if the pregnancy endangers the mother 's health .
this not only refers to health problems during the pregnancy but also afterwards .
in this case , the court judged that the mother 's depressive tendencies would have justified an abortion .
wider implications the verdict has wider implications for other parents of handicapped children in germany .
if they can prove that doctors overlooked the disability during pre-natal examinations , they can now also claim financial support .
all they have to do is say that they would have aborted the fetus , had they known that their child would be handicapped .
handicapped organizations shocked by verdict the supreme court ruling was met with sharp criticism from disabled organizations , politicians and the christian churches in germany .
netzwerk artikel 3 , a network of some 70 german organizations fighting for human rights and equality for disabled people , called the court ruling the " bursting of a dam . "
netzwerk- spokesman ottmar miles-paul said the self-help organizations were outraged that germany 's highest court considered a child born with multiple physical handicaps an unreasonable imposition to its parents .
" pre-natal selection is reality " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the ruling went against christian values .
the cardinal criticized german laws that he said make it possible to " sort out " disabled human beings and put " the decision about life or death of the unborn child " into the fickle hands of parents .
cologne 's cardinal , joachim meisner , said the karlsruhe-based court was no longer a good guardian of the country 's constitution .
he said the judges at germany 's highest court were n't using the law to protect the weakest members of society .
" sending the wrong signals " politicians from all of germany 's main political parties also expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict .
hermann kues , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said the verdict was sending the wrong signals .
ilja seifert , a member of germany 's post-communist party of democratic socialism said the court ruling could contribute to the stigmatization of handicapped people .
jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of germany 's federal physicians board criticized the verdict , saying it represented a stark contrast to the values of a humane society and violated the doctors ' code of ethics .
parents say " a victory for justice " the parents of the disabled child seem to be almost the only ones who are satisfied with the verdict .
sebastian 's father said he was " totally happy . "
he and his wife called the court ruling a " victory for justice . "
for them , a five year odyssey through german courts has finally come to an end . they began their legal quest for compensation immediately after their son 's birth .
sebastian is now five years old and about to enter school .
sebastian 's parents told germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that they had been forced to sue for compensation and damages so they could pay for their handicapped son 's special care .
sebastian needs custom-made gadgets that cater to his disability : a specially made bicycle , for instance , to give him more freedom of movement , and a computer that he can operate with his crippled arms .

progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .
holland is a nation that welcomes immigrants .
despite the recent government efforts to make germany more attractive to highly skilled foreign workers and to offer immigrants inside germany better integration opportunities - including a faster naturalization process - the majority of germans do n't want more immigrants , a fact reconfirmed by poll after poll .
indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . the move effectively puts an end to any hopes entertained by viacom inc , aol time warner 's rival , of taking control of viva .
viacom 's channel , mtv , held a virtual monopoly over music television until viva entered the german market .
brent hansen , mtv 's europe chief , more or less conceded defeat in the battle with aol time warner for viva , speaking of a failure to " fulfill investment criteria and strategic aims " .
aol now owns a stake of 30.6 % in viva , above the level at which a full takeover bid becomes compulsory , under the german takeover code .
if it now takes over shares owned by vivendi universal , its stake will rise to 49.5 % .
vivendi faces a need to reduce its debt burden , so industry insiders believe it 's likely to be willing to sell .
for viva , a takeover by aol is likely to be the best way to secure its survival .
the market for music television is small , and it has been hit particularly hard by the decline in advertising revenue that has been felt across all media .
viva had feared that under the viacom umbrella , it would simply have been closed down .
meanwhile , for the recording companies , it is increasingly the case that music tv broadcasters are seen as purely an advertising platform for their products .
the music companies produce video clips at high cost , and they then give them up for free for broadcast on channels such as viva , onyx and mtv .
music-industry manager balthasar schramm , the new chief of sony music deutschland , has said it 's his medium-term goal to dismantle the independence of this kind of " intermediary between the clients and the music companies " , to enable the music companies to communicate directly with their clients .

progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .

progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .
holland is a nation that welcomes immigrants .
despite the recent government efforts to make germany more attractive to highly skilled foreign workers and to offer immigrants inside germany better integration opportunities - including a faster naturalization process - the majority of germans do n't want more immigrants , a fact reconfirmed by poll after poll .
indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . the move effectively puts an end to any hopes entertained by viacom inc , aol time warner 's rival , of taking control of viva .
viacom 's channel , mtv , held a virtual monopoly over music television until viva entered the german market .
brent hansen , mtv 's europe chief , more or less conceded defeat in the battle with aol time warner for viva , speaking of a failure to " fulfill investment criteria and strategic aims " .
aol now owns a stake of 30.6 % in viva , above the level at which a full takeover bid becomes compulsory , under the german takeover code .
if it now takes over shares owned by vivendi universal , its stake will rise to 49.5 % .
vivendi faces a need to reduce its debt burden , so industry insiders believe it 's likely to be willing to sell .
for viva , a takeover by aol is likely to be the best way to secure its survival .
the market for music television is small , and it has been hit particularly hard by the decline in advertising revenue that has been felt across all media .
viva had feared that under the viacom umbrella , it would simply have been closed down .
meanwhile , for the recording companies , it is increasingly the case that music tv broadcasters are seen as purely an advertising platform for their products .
the music companies produce video clips at high cost , and they then give them up for free for broadcast on channels such as viva , onyx and mtv .
music-industry manager balthasar schramm , the new chief of sony music deutschland , has said it 's his medium-term goal to dismantle the independence of this kind of " intermediary between the clients and the music companies " , to enable the music companies to communicate directly with their clients .
apart from that , the music companies are hoping that there will increasingly be a market for their videos among web companies such as yahoo , which are willing to pay for content . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 23.06.02 © economy .

music-industry manager balthasar schramm , the new chief of sony music deutschland , has said it 's his medium-term goal to dismantle the independence of this kind of " intermediary between the clients and the music companies " , to enable the music companies to communicate directly with their clients .
apart from that , the music companies are hoping that there will increasingly be a market for their videos among web companies such as yahoo , which are willing to pay for content . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 23.06.02 © economy .

the mother says she would have had an abortion if she knew . germany 's federal supreme court is getting publicity it would rather do without right now .
one of its rulings has spurred a heated ethical debate in germany – and hardly anyone is siding with the judges .
the court ruled last week that a doctor has to pay financial support for a child that was born with severe physical disabilities .
the doctor had examined the child 's mother eleven times during her pregnancy , but failed to detect the handicap .
the doctor had misinterpreted an ultra-sound image taken in the 20th week of the pregnancy , in which the disability could already have been seen .
the parents sued the doctor because they said they would have aborted the child if they had known their son sebastian would be born with deformed arms and legs .
sebastian 's mother claimed that having a handicapped child made her depressive and even suicidal .
under german law , an abortion is legal if the pregnancy endangers the mother 's health .
this not only refers to health problems during the pregnancy but also afterwards .
in this case , the court judged that the mother 's depressive tendencies would have justified an abortion .
wider implications the verdict has wider implications for other parents of handicapped children in germany .
if they can prove that doctors overlooked the disability during pre-natal examinations , they can now also claim financial support .
all they have to do is say that they would have aborted the fetus , had they known that their child would be handicapped .
handicapped organizations shocked by verdict the supreme court ruling was met with sharp criticism from disabled organizations , politicians and the christian churches in germany .
netzwerk artikel 3 , a network of some 70 german organizations fighting for human rights and equality for disabled people , called the court ruling the " bursting of a dam . "
netzwerk- spokesman ottmar miles-paul said the self-help organizations were outraged that germany 's highest court considered a child born with multiple physical handicaps an unreasonable imposition to its parents .
" pre-natal selection is reality " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the ruling went against christian values .
the cardinal criticized german laws that he said make it possible to " sort out " disabled human beings and put " the decision about life or death of the unborn child " into the fickle hands of parents .
cologne 's cardinal , joachim meisner , said the karlsruhe-based court was no longer a good guardian of the country 's constitution .
he said the judges at germany 's highest court were n't using the law to protect the weakest members of society .
" sending the wrong signals " politicians from all of germany 's main political parties also expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict .
hermann kues , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said the verdict was sending the wrong signals .
ilja seifert , a member of germany 's post-communist party of democratic socialism said the court ruling could contribute to the stigmatization of handicapped people .
jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of germany 's federal physicians board criticized the verdict , saying it represented a stark contrast to the values of a humane society and violated the doctors ' code of ethics .
parents say " a victory for justice " the parents of the disabled child seem to be almost the only ones who are satisfied with the verdict .
sebastian 's father said he was " totally happy . "
he and his wife called the court ruling a " victory for justice . "
for them , a five year odyssey through german courts has finally come to an end . they began their legal quest for compensation immediately after their son 's birth .
sebastian is now five years old and about to enter school .
sebastian 's parents told germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that they had been forced to sue for compensation and damages so they could pay for their handicapped son 's special care .
sebastian needs custom-made gadgets that cater to his disability : a specially made bicycle , for instance , to give him more freedom of movement , and a computer that he can operate with his crippled arms .
but since sebastian 's mother had to give up her job to take care of her son and sebastian 's father is a blue-collar worker , they would n't have been able to afford any of these things otherwise .

the mother says she would have had an abortion if she knew . germany 's federal supreme court is getting publicity it would rather do without right now .
one of its rulings has spurred a heated ethical debate in germany – and hardly anyone is siding with the judges .
the court ruled last week that a doctor has to pay financial support for a child that was born with severe physical disabilities .
the doctor had examined the child 's mother eleven times during her pregnancy , but failed to detect the handicap .
the doctor had misinterpreted an ultra-sound image taken in the 20th week of the pregnancy , in which the disability could already have been seen .
the parents sued the doctor because they said they would have aborted the child if they had known their son sebastian would be born with deformed arms and legs .
sebastian 's mother claimed that having a handicapped child made her depressive and even suicidal .
under german law , an abortion is legal if the pregnancy endangers the mother 's health .
this not only refers to health problems during the pregnancy but also afterwards .
in this case , the court judged that the mother 's depressive tendencies would have justified an abortion .
wider implications the verdict has wider implications for other parents of handicapped children in germany .
if they can prove that doctors overlooked the disability during pre-natal examinations , they can now also claim financial support .
all they have to do is say that they would have aborted the fetus , had they known that their child would be handicapped .
handicapped organizations shocked by verdict the supreme court ruling was met with sharp criticism from disabled organizations , politicians and the christian churches in germany .
netzwerk artikel 3 , a network of some 70 german organizations fighting for human rights and equality for disabled people , called the court ruling the " bursting of a dam . "
netzwerk- spokesman ottmar miles-paul said the self-help organizations were outraged that germany 's highest court considered a child born with multiple physical handicaps an unreasonable imposition to its parents .
" pre-natal selection is reality " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the ruling went against christian values .
the cardinal criticized german laws that he said make it possible to " sort out " disabled human beings and put " the decision about life or death of the unborn child " into the fickle hands of parents .
cologne 's cardinal , joachim meisner , said the karlsruhe-based court was no longer a good guardian of the country 's constitution .
he said the judges at germany 's highest court were n't using the law to protect the weakest members of society .

netzwerk artikel 3 , a network of some 70 german organizations fighting for human rights and equality for disabled people , called the court ruling the " bursting of a dam . "
netzwerk- spokesman ottmar miles-paul said the self-help organizations were outraged that germany 's highest court considered a child born with multiple physical handicaps an unreasonable imposition to its parents .
" pre-natal selection is reality " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the ruling went against christian values .
the cardinal criticized german laws that he said make it possible to " sort out " disabled human beings and put " the decision about life or death of the unborn child " into the fickle hands of parents .
cologne 's cardinal , joachim meisner , said the karlsruhe-based court was no longer a good guardian of the country 's constitution .
he said the judges at germany 's highest court were n't using the law to protect the weakest members of society .
" sending the wrong signals " politicians from all of germany 's main political parties also expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict .
hermann kues , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said the verdict was sending the wrong signals .
ilja seifert , a member of germany 's post-communist party of democratic socialism said the court ruling could contribute to the stigmatization of handicapped people .
jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of germany 's federal physicians board criticized the verdict , saying it represented a stark contrast to the values of a humane society and violated the doctors ' code of ethics .
parents say " a victory for justice " the parents of the disabled child seem to be almost the only ones who are satisfied with the verdict .
sebastian 's father said he was " totally happy . "
he and his wife called the court ruling a " victory for justice . "
for them , a five year odyssey through german courts has finally come to an end . they began their legal quest for compensation immediately after their son 's birth .
sebastian is now five years old and about to enter school .
sebastian 's parents told germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that they had been forced to sue for compensation and damages so they could pay for their handicapped son 's special care .
sebastian needs custom-made gadgets that cater to his disability : a specially made bicycle , for instance , to give him more freedom of movement , and a computer that he can operate with his crippled arms .

the mother says she would have had an abortion if she knew . germany 's federal supreme court is getting publicity it would rather do without right now .
one of its rulings has spurred a heated ethical debate in germany – and hardly anyone is siding with the judges .
the court ruled last week that a doctor has to pay financial support for a child that was born with severe physical disabilities .
the doctor had examined the child 's mother eleven times during her pregnancy , but failed to detect the handicap .
the doctor had misinterpreted an ultra-sound image taken in the 20th week of the pregnancy , in which the disability could already have been seen .
the parents sued the doctor because they said they would have aborted the child if they had known their son sebastian would be born with deformed arms and legs .
sebastian 's mother claimed that having a handicapped child made her depressive and even suicidal .
under german law , an abortion is legal if the pregnancy endangers the mother 's health .
this not only refers to health problems during the pregnancy but also afterwards .
in this case , the court judged that the mother 's depressive tendencies would have justified an abortion .
wider implications the verdict has wider implications for other parents of handicapped children in germany .
if they can prove that doctors overlooked the disability during pre-natal examinations , they can now also claim financial support .
all they have to do is say that they would have aborted the fetus , had they known that their child would be handicapped .

the court ruled last week that a doctor has to pay financial support for a child that was born with severe physical disabilities .
the doctor had examined the child 's mother eleven times during her pregnancy , but failed to detect the handicap .
the doctor had misinterpreted an ultra-sound image taken in the 20th week of the pregnancy , in which the disability could already have been seen .
the parents sued the doctor because they said they would have aborted the child if they had known their son sebastian would be born with deformed arms and legs .
sebastian 's mother claimed that having a handicapped child made her depressive and even suicidal .
under german law , an abortion is legal if the pregnancy endangers the mother 's health .
this not only refers to health problems during the pregnancy but also afterwards .
in this case , the court judged that the mother 's depressive tendencies would have justified an abortion .
wider implications the verdict has wider implications for other parents of handicapped children in germany .
if they can prove that doctors overlooked the disability during pre-natal examinations , they can now also claim financial support .
all they have to do is say that they would have aborted the fetus , had they known that their child would be handicapped .
handicapped organizations shocked by verdict the supreme court ruling was met with sharp criticism from disabled organizations , politicians and the christian churches in germany .
netzwerk artikel 3 , a network of some 70 german organizations fighting for human rights and equality for disabled people , called the court ruling the " bursting of a dam . "
netzwerk- spokesman ottmar miles-paul said the self-help organizations were outraged that germany 's highest court considered a child born with multiple physical handicaps an unreasonable imposition to its parents .
" pre-natal selection is reality " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the ruling went against christian values .
the cardinal criticized german laws that he said make it possible to " sort out " disabled human beings and put " the decision about life or death of the unborn child " into the fickle hands of parents .
cologne 's cardinal , joachim meisner , said the karlsruhe-based court was no longer a good guardian of the country 's constitution .
he said the judges at germany 's highest court were n't using the law to protect the weakest members of society .
" sending the wrong signals " politicians from all of germany 's main political parties also expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict .
hermann kues , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said the verdict was sending the wrong signals .
ilja seifert , a member of germany 's post-communist party of democratic socialism said the court ruling could contribute to the stigmatization of handicapped people .
jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of germany 's federal physicians board criticized the verdict , saying it represented a stark contrast to the values of a humane society and violated the doctors ' code of ethics .
parents say " a victory for justice " the parents of the disabled child seem to be almost the only ones who are satisfied with the verdict .
sebastian 's father said he was " totally happy . "
he and his wife called the court ruling a " victory for justice . "
for them , a five year odyssey through german courts has finally come to an end . they began their legal quest for compensation immediately after their son 's birth .
sebastian is now five years old and about to enter school .
sebastian 's parents told germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that they had been forced to sue for compensation and damages so they could pay for their handicapped son 's special care .
sebastian needs custom-made gadgets that cater to his disability : a specially made bicycle , for instance , to give him more freedom of movement , and a computer that he can operate with his crippled arms .
but since sebastian 's mother had to give up her job to take care of her son and sebastian 's father is a blue-collar worker , they would n't have been able to afford any of these things otherwise .

progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .
holland is a nation that welcomes immigrants .
despite the recent government efforts to make germany more attractive to highly skilled foreign workers and to offer immigrants inside germany better integration opportunities - including a faster naturalization process - the majority of germans do n't want more immigrants , a fact reconfirmed by poll after poll .
indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . the move effectively puts an end to any hopes entertained by viacom inc , aol time warner 's rival , of taking control of viva .
viacom 's channel , mtv , held a virtual monopoly over music television until viva entered the german market .
brent hansen , mtv 's europe chief , more or less conceded defeat in the battle with aol time warner for viva , speaking of a failure to " fulfill investment criteria and strategic aims " .
aol now owns a stake of 30.6 % in viva , above the level at which a full takeover bid becomes compulsory , under the german takeover code .
if it now takes over shares owned by vivendi universal , its stake will rise to 49.5 % .

progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .
holland is a nation that welcomes immigrants .
despite the recent government efforts to make germany more attractive to highly skilled foreign workers and to offer immigrants inside germany better integration opportunities - including a faster naturalization process - the majority of germans do n't want more immigrants , a fact reconfirmed by poll after poll .
indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.06.2002 integration : learning from holland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch policies bridge the gap between natives and immigrants immigration reformers in germany need look no further than their next-door neighbor .
progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .
holland is a nation that welcomes immigrants .
despite the recent government efforts to make germany more attractive to highly skilled foreign workers and to offer immigrants inside germany better integration opportunities - including a faster naturalization process - the majority of germans do n't want more immigrants , a fact reconfirmed by poll after poll .
indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

the mother says she would have had an abortion if she knew . germany 's federal supreme court is getting publicity it would rather do without right now .
one of its rulings has spurred a heated ethical debate in germany – and hardly anyone is siding with the judges .
the court ruled last week that a doctor has to pay financial support for a child that was born with severe physical disabilities .
the doctor had examined the child 's mother eleven times during her pregnancy , but failed to detect the handicap .
the doctor had misinterpreted an ultra-sound image taken in the 20th week of the pregnancy , in which the disability could already have been seen .
the parents sued the doctor because they said they would have aborted the child if they had known their son sebastian would be born with deformed arms and legs .
sebastian 's mother claimed that having a handicapped child made her depressive and even suicidal .
under german law , an abortion is legal if the pregnancy endangers the mother 's health .
this not only refers to health problems during the pregnancy but also afterwards .
in this case , the court judged that the mother 's depressive tendencies would have justified an abortion .
wider implications the verdict has wider implications for other parents of handicapped children in germany .
if they can prove that doctors overlooked the disability during pre-natal examinations , they can now also claim financial support .
all they have to do is say that they would have aborted the fetus , had they known that their child would be handicapped .
handicapped organizations shocked by verdict the supreme court ruling was met with sharp criticism from disabled organizations , politicians and the christian churches in germany .
netzwerk artikel 3 , a network of some 70 german organizations fighting for human rights and equality for disabled people , called the court ruling the " bursting of a dam . "
netzwerk- spokesman ottmar miles-paul said the self-help organizations were outraged that germany 's highest court considered a child born with multiple physical handicaps an unreasonable imposition to its parents .
" pre-natal selection is reality " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the ruling went against christian values .
the cardinal criticized german laws that he said make it possible to " sort out " disabled human beings and put " the decision about life or death of the unborn child " into the fickle hands of parents .
cologne 's cardinal , joachim meisner , said the karlsruhe-based court was no longer a good guardian of the country 's constitution .
he said the judges at germany 's highest court were n't using the law to protect the weakest members of society .
" sending the wrong signals " politicians from all of germany 's main political parties also expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict .
hermann kues , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said the verdict was sending the wrong signals .
ilja seifert , a member of germany 's post-communist party of democratic socialism said the court ruling could contribute to the stigmatization of handicapped people .
jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of germany 's federal physicians board criticized the verdict , saying it represented a stark contrast to the values of a humane society and violated the doctors ' code of ethics .
parents say " a victory for justice " the parents of the disabled child seem to be almost the only ones who are satisfied with the verdict .
sebastian 's father said he was " totally happy . "
he and his wife called the court ruling a " victory for justice . "
for them , a five year odyssey through german courts has finally come to an end . they began their legal quest for compensation immediately after their son 's birth .
sebastian is now five years old and about to enter school .
sebastian 's parents told germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that they had been forced to sue for compensation and damages so they could pay for their handicapped son 's special care .
sebastian needs custom-made gadgets that cater to his disability : a specially made bicycle , for instance , to give him more freedom of movement , and a computer that he can operate with his crippled arms .
but since sebastian 's mother had to give up her job to take care of her son and sebastian 's father is a blue-collar worker , they would n't have been able to afford any of these things otherwise .

the mother says she would have had an abortion if she knew . germany 's federal supreme court is getting publicity it would rather do without right now .
one of its rulings has spurred a heated ethical debate in germany – and hardly anyone is siding with the judges .
the court ruled last week that a doctor has to pay financial support for a child that was born with severe physical disabilities .
the doctor had examined the child 's mother eleven times during her pregnancy , but failed to detect the handicap .
the doctor had misinterpreted an ultra-sound image taken in the 20th week of the pregnancy , in which the disability could already have been seen .
the parents sued the doctor because they said they would have aborted the child if they had known their son sebastian would be born with deformed arms and legs .
sebastian 's mother claimed that having a handicapped child made her depressive and even suicidal .
under german law , an abortion is legal if the pregnancy endangers the mother 's health .
this not only refers to health problems during the pregnancy but also afterwards .
in this case , the court judged that the mother 's depressive tendencies would have justified an abortion .
wider implications the verdict has wider implications for other parents of handicapped children in germany .
if they can prove that doctors overlooked the disability during pre-natal examinations , they can now also claim financial support .
all they have to do is say that they would have aborted the fetus , had they known that their child would be handicapped .
handicapped organizations shocked by verdict the supreme court ruling was met with sharp criticism from disabled organizations , politicians and the christian churches in germany .
netzwerk artikel 3 , a network of some 70 german organizations fighting for human rights and equality for disabled people , called the court ruling the " bursting of a dam . "
netzwerk- spokesman ottmar miles-paul said the self-help organizations were outraged that germany 's highest court considered a child born with multiple physical handicaps an unreasonable imposition to its parents .
" pre-natal selection is reality " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the ruling went against christian values .
the cardinal criticized german laws that he said make it possible to " sort out " disabled human beings and put " the decision about life or death of the unborn child " into the fickle hands of parents .
cologne 's cardinal , joachim meisner , said the karlsruhe-based court was no longer a good guardian of the country 's constitution .
he said the judges at germany 's highest court were n't using the law to protect the weakest members of society .
" sending the wrong signals " politicians from all of germany 's main political parties also expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict .
hermann kues , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said the verdict was sending the wrong signals .
ilja seifert , a member of germany 's post-communist party of democratic socialism said the court ruling could contribute to the stigmatization of handicapped people .
jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of germany 's federal physicians board criticized the verdict , saying it represented a stark contrast to the values of a humane society and violated the doctors ' code of ethics .
parents say " a victory for justice " the parents of the disabled child seem to be almost the only ones who are satisfied with the verdict .
sebastian 's father said he was " totally happy . "
he and his wife called the court ruling a " victory for justice . "
for them , a five year odyssey through german courts has finally come to an end . they began their legal quest for compensation immediately after their son 's birth .
sebastian is now five years old and about to enter school .
sebastian 's parents told germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that they had been forced to sue for compensation and damages so they could pay for their handicapped son 's special care .
sebastian needs custom-made gadgets that cater to his disability : a specially made bicycle , for instance , to give him more freedom of movement , and a computer that he can operate with his crippled arms .
but since sebastian 's mother had to give up her job to take care of her son and sebastian 's father is a blue-collar worker , they would n't have been able to afford any of these things otherwise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.06.2002 aol time warner seen to have won battle for viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for viva , a takeover by aol is likely to be the best way to secure its survival .
british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . the move effectively puts an end to any hopes entertained by viacom inc , aol time warner 's rival , of taking control of viva .
viacom 's channel , mtv , held a virtual monopoly over music television until viva entered the german market .
brent hansen , mtv 's europe chief , more or less conceded defeat in the battle with aol time warner for viva , speaking of a failure to " fulfill investment criteria and strategic aims " .
aol now owns a stake of 30.6 % in viva , above the level at which a full takeover bid becomes compulsory , under the german takeover code .
if it now takes over shares owned by vivendi universal , its stake will rise to 49.5 % .
vivendi faces a need to reduce its debt burden , so industry insiders believe it 's likely to be willing to sell .
for viva , a takeover by aol is likely to be the best way to secure its survival .
the market for music television is small , and it has been hit particularly hard by the decline in advertising revenue that has been felt across all media .
viva had feared that under the viacom umbrella , it would simply have been closed down .
meanwhile , for the recording companies , it is increasingly the case that music tv broadcasters are seen as purely an advertising platform for their products .
the music companies produce video clips at high cost , and they then give them up for free for broadcast on channels such as viva , onyx and mtv .
music-industry manager balthasar schramm , the new chief of sony music deutschland , has said it 's his medium-term goal to dismantle the independence of this kind of " intermediary between the clients and the music companies " , to enable the music companies to communicate directly with their clients .
apart from that , the music companies are hoping that there will increasingly be a market for their videos among web companies such as yahoo , which are willing to pay for content . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 23.06.02 © economy .

british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . the move effectively puts an end to any hopes entertained by viacom inc , aol time warner 's rival , of taking control of viva .
viacom 's channel , mtv , held a virtual monopoly over music television until viva entered the german market .
brent hansen , mtv 's europe chief , more or less conceded defeat in the battle with aol time warner for viva , speaking of a failure to " fulfill investment criteria and strategic aims " .
aol now owns a stake of 30.6 % in viva , above the level at which a full takeover bid becomes compulsory , under the german takeover code .
if it now takes over shares owned by vivendi universal , its stake will rise to 49.5 % .
vivendi faces a need to reduce its debt burden , so industry insiders believe it 's likely to be willing to sell .
for viva , a takeover by aol is likely to be the best way to secure its survival .
the market for music television is small , and it has been hit particularly hard by the decline in advertising revenue that has been felt across all media .
viva had feared that under the viacom umbrella , it would simply have been closed down .
meanwhile , for the recording companies , it is increasingly the case that music tv broadcasters are seen as purely an advertising platform for their products .
the music companies produce video clips at high cost , and they then give them up for free for broadcast on channels such as viva , onyx and mtv .
music-industry manager balthasar schramm , the new chief of sony music deutschland , has said it 's his medium-term goal to dismantle the independence of this kind of " intermediary between the clients and the music companies " , to enable the music companies to communicate directly with their clients .

progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .
holland is a nation that welcomes immigrants .
despite the recent government efforts to make germany more attractive to highly skilled foreign workers and to offer immigrants inside germany better integration opportunities - including a faster naturalization process - the majority of germans do n't want more immigrants , a fact reconfirmed by poll after poll .
indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . the move effectively puts an end to any hopes entertained by viacom inc , aol time warner 's rival , of taking control of viva .
viacom 's channel , mtv , held a virtual monopoly over music television until viva entered the german market .
brent hansen , mtv 's europe chief , more or less conceded defeat in the battle with aol time warner for viva , speaking of a failure to " fulfill investment criteria and strategic aims " .
aol now owns a stake of 30.6 % in viva , above the level at which a full takeover bid becomes compulsory , under the german takeover code .
if it now takes over shares owned by vivendi universal , its stake will rise to 49.5 % .
vivendi faces a need to reduce its debt burden , so industry insiders believe it 's likely to be willing to sell .
for viva , a takeover by aol is likely to be the best way to secure its survival .
the market for music television is small , and it has been hit particularly hard by the decline in advertising revenue that has been felt across all media .
viva had feared that under the viacom umbrella , it would simply have been closed down .
meanwhile , for the recording companies , it is increasingly the case that music tv broadcasters are seen as purely an advertising platform for their products .
the music companies produce video clips at high cost , and they then give them up for free for broadcast on channels such as viva , onyx and mtv .
music-industry manager balthasar schramm , the new chief of sony music deutschland , has said it 's his medium-term goal to dismantle the independence of this kind of " intermediary between the clients and the music companies " , to enable the music companies to communicate directly with their clients .
apart from that , the music companies are hoping that there will increasingly be a market for their videos among web companies such as yahoo , which are willing to pay for content . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 23.06.02 © economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.06.2002 integration : learning from holland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch policies bridge the gap between natives and immigrants immigration reformers in germany need look no further than their next-door neighbor .
progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .
holland is a nation that welcomes immigrants .
despite the recent government efforts to make germany more attractive to highly skilled foreign workers and to offer immigrants inside germany better integration opportunities - including a faster naturalization process - the majority of germans do n't want more immigrants , a fact reconfirmed by poll after poll .
indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .
the dutch are still a colonial power , and more than 40 percent of the foreign-born immigrants living in the country come from suriname or indonesia , former colonies .
turkish and morroccans constitute the next biggest slice of the immigrant population pie .
and out of all european countries , the netherlands naturalizes the highest amount of immigrants .
nine percent of the applications for citizenship are approved compared to a rate of 1.1 percent in germany .
holland is a nation that welcomes immigrants .
despite the recent government efforts to make germany more attractive to highly skilled foreign workers and to offer immigrants inside germany better integration opportunities - including a faster naturalization process - the majority of germans do n't want more immigrants , a fact reconfirmed by poll after poll .
indeed , the words uttered years ago by former chancellor helmut kohl still ring true in the attitudes of many in germany : " germany is not a country of immigration . "
but with its planned integration program , the germany government is taking a major step toward making immigration more successful .
and as immigrants become better versed in german language and culture , advocates hope the attitude towards their presence changes for the better .

british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . the move effectively puts an end to any hopes entertained by viacom inc , aol time warner 's rival , of taking control of viva .
viacom 's channel , mtv , held a virtual monopoly over music television until viva entered the german market .
brent hansen , mtv 's europe chief , more or less conceded defeat in the battle with aol time warner for viva , speaking of a failure to " fulfill investment criteria and strategic aims " .
aol now owns a stake of 30.6 % in viva , above the level at which a full takeover bid becomes compulsory , under the german takeover code .
if it now takes over shares owned by vivendi universal , its stake will rise to 49.5 % .
vivendi faces a need to reduce its debt burden , so industry insiders believe it 's likely to be willing to sell .
for viva , a takeover by aol is likely to be the best way to secure its survival .
the market for music television is small , and it has been hit particularly hard by the decline in advertising revenue that has been felt across all media .
viva had feared that under the viacom umbrella , it would simply have been closed down .
meanwhile , for the recording companies , it is increasingly the case that music tv broadcasters are seen as purely an advertising platform for their products .
the music companies produce video clips at high cost , and they then give them up for free for broadcast on channels such as viva , onyx and mtv .
music-industry manager balthasar schramm , the new chief of sony music deutschland , has said it 's his medium-term goal to dismantle the independence of this kind of " intermediary between the clients and the music companies " , to enable the music companies to communicate directly with their clients .

progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .

british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . the move effectively puts an end to any hopes entertained by viacom inc , aol time warner 's rival , of taking control of viva .
viacom 's channel , mtv , held a virtual monopoly over music television until viva entered the german market .
brent hansen , mtv 's europe chief , more or less conceded defeat in the battle with aol time warner for viva , speaking of a failure to " fulfill investment criteria and strategic aims " .
aol now owns a stake of 30.6 % in viva , above the level at which a full takeover bid becomes compulsory , under the german takeover code .
if it now takes over shares owned by vivendi universal , its stake will rise to 49.5 % .
vivendi faces a need to reduce its debt burden , so industry insiders believe it 's likely to be willing to sell .
for viva , a takeover by aol is likely to be the best way to secure its survival .
the market for music television is small , and it has been hit particularly hard by the decline in advertising revenue that has been felt across all media .
viva had feared that under the viacom umbrella , it would simply have been closed down .
meanwhile , for the recording companies , it is increasingly the case that music tv broadcasters are seen as purely an advertising platform for their products .
the music companies produce video clips at high cost , and they then give them up for free for broadcast on channels such as viva , onyx and mtv .
music-industry manager balthasar schramm , the new chief of sony music deutschland , has said it 's his medium-term goal to dismantle the independence of this kind of " intermediary between the clients and the music companies " , to enable the music companies to communicate directly with their clients .
apart from that , the music companies are hoping that there will increasingly be a market for their videos among web companies such as yahoo , which are willing to pay for content . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 23.06.02 © economy .

progressive policies in immigration and integration have long been the norm in holland , and germany is starting to take notice . two years ago , german legislators peeked into their neighbor 's backyard in search of models for integrating new immigrants .
the commission charged with drafting an immigration reform proposal headed by the former president of the german parliament , rita süssmuth of the christian democratic union , found the dutch programs " exemplary . "
some of the lessons learned in holland are reflected in germany 's first-ever immigration law , which was passed in march and signed into law on thursday .
the integration of foreigners by means of language and orientation courses , which have proven successful in the netherlands for nearly five years , are among the law 's primary aims .
one of the keys to the success of the dutch " active integration " approach is that it demands that immigrants take their own initiative .
it includes a system of benefits and sanctions to encourage immigrants to complete the program .
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps six weeks after arrival , every newcomer is required to enlist in a free educational program .
the courses on culture studies , work life and language are tailor-made to meet the needs of the individual .
a personally assigned " integration pilot " serves as a guide , providing social and professional orientation .
upon completing the one-year program , participants are required to take a test that proves them to be eligible for job training and further education administered through their community of residence .
should an individual fail to enlist in the program or skip the examination without a valid excuse , social insurance benefits are reduced .
the german adaptation follows in the same direction , providing stiff penalties like benefits cuts , for those that fail to attempt to integrate themselves .
at the same time , numerous details had to be watered-down for practical reasons .
beyond germany ’ s means first and foremost , the dutch program is too expensive .
" doing it like the dutch would be like buying a mercedes when all we can afford is a polo , " says gerhard fiedler , executive director of the german language association .
indeed , the dutch spend considerably more on integration efforts per person than germany .
" we should keep in mind that the netherlands spends 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,720 -rrb- per person , almost five times as much as the sum we 're prepared to pay , " says barbara john , commissioner for foreigners ' affairs in the city-state of berlin .
the netherlands has been offering integration courses to immigrants from countries outside the european union since 1998 .
the government in the hague invests 45 million euro -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- a year in its integration programs and has plans to double that amount .
the dutch also have a ministry of urban policy and integration of minorities , which is responsible for distributing funds for the programs .
germany , by contrast , has no centralized agency .
instead , a handful of public institutions compete for funds .
holland 's colonial benevolence holland 's excellent infrastructure for integration partially stems from the fact that public and political attitudes toward immigration are 20 years ahead of their german counterparts .

the drugs minister bob ainsworth will warn that all parts of britain are now at risk from the spread of crack .
click here to watch our drugs interview .
we talked to aidan gray who works for the conference on crack and cocaine : a group set up to support professionals working in the area .
he said : " it is a growing problem in every part of the country . "
crack cocaine is a form of cocaine that 's been altered .
you can smoke this type of cocaine and it gives you a bigger high .
it 's not a major epidemic , but addiction is growing steadily all over the country .
we need to address this problem .
the government says all parts of the country are at risk from the spreading use of the drug , and the crime and violence associated with it .
the drugs minister bob ainsworth wants people to help people fight it by reporting dealers to the police .
bob ainsworth will say crack poses a bigger danger than many other drugs he will also urge communities to help educate young people about the dangers of addiction .
crack has been available in the uk for more than a decade .
it is a kind of cocaine " cooked " into rocks which can be smoked .
the high it gives is quickly followed by a low , and a desperate craving for more .
latest figures indicate that use of crack cocaine is particularly on the increase among black communities and the 16 to 24-year-olds .
meanwhile the price of the drug is falling , suggesting that supply is plentiful - even though record amounts have been seized .
treatment shortage the conference , being held in birmingham , will hear that in cities such as london and bristol , special police operations have been set up to arrest dealers and stamp out crack-related crime .
mr ainsworth will tell delegates that crack poses a bigger danger than many other drugs because of it has more links with crime than ecstasy , and more connections with violence than heroin .
drug treatment workers say there is a shortage of treatment places for crack addicts .
even with substantial investment in new schemes , experts say it would take several years to bring the problem under control .
in april steve pilkington , chief constable of avon and somerset police , warned of a crime epidemic fuelled by crack cocaine .
he said the country was experiencing the same problems faced by america a decade ago .
mr pilkington said drugs were directly responsible for soaring crime figures in bristol .

he told the bbc the government 's obsession with spin was mainly to blame for the " trust problem " .
he made the admissions on sunday as labour 's opinion poll lead over the conservatives fell to its lowest level since the fuel protests in 2000 .
labour says it is in favour of joining the european single currency if five economic tests are met .
those are expected to be ruled on next year , with the possibility of a referendum being held soon after .
his concern over winning it comes just days after mr blair hosted the first of a series of televised news conferences in downing street , where he dismissed questions about his government 's troubles with spin .
mr hain told the bbc 's breakfast with frost that there is a problem with spin that needed to be resolved .
" we have got a very good record of success in government on health and education and jobs - the lowest unemployment for a generation - and the economy stronger than it has been since anybody can remember , " he said .
euro campaign " but yes , we do have a trust problem and if we are calling a referendum , clearly we have to deal with that . "
meanwhile british businesses are being encouraged to welcome the euro - whether they agree with it or not .
the british chamber of commerce -lrb- bcc -rrb- is preparing to launch a campaign to ensure its 135,000 members are ready for the single currency , as it believes a referendum on the issue is likely to be held within a year .
mr hain said chancellor gordon brown 's five economic tests to assess whether the uk was ready to join the euro would be made next june , although he did not know exactly when .
the europe minister said the tests were important to prevent a repeat of black wednesday when the british pound was forced to leave the exchange rate mechanism , a dress-rehearsal for the euro , in 1992 .
joining the euro had to be good for britain 's stability and economic success , he said , adding that he hoped the tests would be rigorous .
" i will want to be sure ... that the economic assessment , if it is a ' yes ' to pave the way for a referendum , that this is done in a serious , hard-headed , responsible way , " he said .
crime concerns labour 's opinion poll lead over the conservatives has dropped to just three points , according to a poll for the sunday times .
the survey by yougov showed labour on 38 % and the conservatives on 35 % .
a month ago , a similar poll put labour eight points ahead of the tories .
the results showed that the public is most concerned about crime .
only 4 % of those asked believing that mr blair had met his 1997 pledge to be " tough on crime and the causes of crime " , while 66 % claimed he had failed .

his concern over winning it comes just days after mr blair hosted the first of a series of televised news conferences in downing street , where he dismissed questions about his government 's troubles with spin .
mr hain told the bbc 's breakfast with frost that there is a problem with spin that needed to be resolved .
" we have got a very good record of success in government on health and education and jobs - the lowest unemployment for a generation - and the economy stronger than it has been since anybody can remember , " he said .
euro campaign " but yes , we do have a trust problem and if we are calling a referendum , clearly we have to deal with that . "
meanwhile british businesses are being encouraged to welcome the euro - whether they agree with it or not .
the british chamber of commerce -lrb- bcc -rrb- is preparing to launch a campaign to ensure its 135,000 members are ready for the single currency , as it believes a referendum on the issue is likely to be held within a year .
blair dismissed questions about his government 's troubles with spin mr hain said chancellor gordon brown 's five economic tests to assess whether the uk was ready to join the euro would be made next june , although he did not know exactly when .
the europe minister said the tests were important to prevent a repeat of black wednesday when the british pound was forced to leave the exchange rate mechanism , a dress-rehearsal for the euro , in 1992 .
joining the euro had to be good for britain 's stability and economic success , he said , adding that he hoped the tests would be rigorous .
" i will want to be sure ... that the economic assessment , if it is a ' yes ' to pave the way for a referendum , that this is done in a serious , hard-headed , responsible way , " he said .
crime concerns labour 's opinion poll lead over the conservatives has dropped to just three points , according to a poll for the sunday times .
the survey by yougov showed labour on 38 % and the conservatives on 35 % .
a month ago , a similar poll put labour eight points ahead of the tories .
the results showed that the public is most concerned about crime .
only 4 % of those asked believing that mr blair had met his 1997 pledge to be " tough on crime and the causes of crime " , while 66 % claimed he had failed . watch / listen on this story peter hain mp , europe minister " we do have a trust problem - if we call a referendum we will have to deal with that " the bbc 's robin chrystal " the last week has been particularly difficult for the government " full coverage key stories lamont 's erm warning firms ' turning anti ' warning over may poll hitler spoof slammed geldof says no to euro political elite shunned in or out ?

the tory former cabinet minister argued that if he had seized the title he would have made such " big changes " to the party that he would not have been popular with its members .
if i had won , i would have made big changes in the conservative party and a lot of those changes would not have been popular michael portillo mr portillo , mp for kensington and chelsea , was voted out of the tory leadership contest in the penultimate round last july .
the trophy was finally seized by iain duncan smith following the resignation as leader by william hague in the wake of the conservative party 's defeat in the 2001 general election .
mr portillo said he had made a concerted effort to stay out of the spotlight since the leadership battle , to ensure he did not come across as a " backseat driver " to mr duncan smith .

asked by bbc 's breakfast with frost whether he was relieved not to have become tory party leader , mr portillo said : " i would say i was even relieved at the time in a way .

a change too far ?
" so actually , i thought it would be terrible trying to do what i wanted to do without the sort of force of mandate . "
mr portillo said his most controversial change would have been to the way candidates are selected .
" i would have wanted to make a very big show that the conservative party had changed .
" i think back to the way that tony blair had that great fight over clause four .
in a way it was n't even a necessary fight , but it was a way of demonstrating that the party had moved on .
" i think in the conservative party , it might have been over the issue of candidate selection because the tory party , and i think ids would say the same , needs to move to a situation where its candidates look like the population of the country .
stress free year " it is not just that we do n't have enough women and we do n't have enough ethnic minorities , it is also that we do n't have enough teachers , nurses and doctors as candidates . "
mr portillo admitted that his ambitions as a child were to be prime minister - and david frost .
" i have had wonderful luck because i now have a career in politics and i am doing some work on tv , " he said .
" i do n't terribly want to make the choice .
i do n't see myself going back to the front line of politics . "
mr portillo said his current plans were to stand again as mp for kensington and chelsea and he had enjoyed a stress free year which " is a terrific bonus after a lot of years in politics " .

the firm 's administrators are poised to sell off key assets and give birth to the new firm that will take control of the uk 's crippled railways .
railtrack group is set to hand over the railways to a new state-backed firm called network rail for £ 500m .
it had been expected the deal would be announced on monday .
but on sunday night it emerged that sticking points over part of it - the group 's anticipated offloading of phase one of its high-speed rail link for £ 295m - had caused a delay . "
it is time for a fresh start for the rail industry " ian mcallister network rail the railtrack group confirmed in a statement that certain issues were still outstanding , some of which could have prevented cash being returned to shareholders within an acceptable timescale .
" this has caused the board to delay signing the contracts for the sale of railtrack plc and the group 's interests in the channel tunnel rail link , " the statement said .
" all parties are confident that these issues can be satisfactorily concluded shortly . "
a spokeswoman for the department of transport spokeswoman added : " this is a complex set of commercial transactions and the government and all parties believe they will be resolved shortly . "
following the sell-off , shares in the remnants of the railtrack group are likely to be re-listed on the london stock exchange .
that will give investors the first chance to sell their stock since railtrack was forced into administration by the former transport secretary stephen byers last october .

" it is time for a fresh start for the rail industry , " said the new company 's chairman ian mcallister .
" this is an opportunity to endorse a better way of working , bringing the industry together for the benefit of all rail users . "
network rail is in the final stages of negotiating with a syndicate of banks for a £ 9bn bridging loan , and will take on £ 6.5bn of railtrack debt .
and , according to a sunday press report , the government will then provide a further £ 10bn as a back-up .
back to market sources say shares in the remnants of railtrack will be re-listed at a price of about 250p .
that 's the same amount as the compensation being offered to shareholders .
and it is 30p below the price when mr byers pulled the plug on the troubled firm .
railtrack shares once soared to £ 17 before beginning the steep decline that ended in administration following a series of train crashes .
railtrack will be little more than a shell following the sell-off of its assets , and is likely to be liquidated before the end of the year .
the two deals are subject to approval by railtrack shareholders at a general meeting expected in july .

the margin for error was razor thin balloonist steve fossett mr fossett , a 58-year-old former stockbroker , is currently attempting to avoid storms around the south american continent after coming " perilously close " to smashing into the ocean as he battled storms in his latest attempt to fly a balloon around the world single-handedly .
the us adventurer had dropped low over the south pacific on monday in an attempt to avoid being caught up in thunderstorms , however he was almost driven into the sea .
mr fossett , 58 , used three gas burners to counter downdrafts during squalls east of new zealand but the balloon dipped to as low as 120 metres -lrb- 400 feet -rrb- above the waves .
click here to see a map of the flight he has since regained an altitude of about 8170m -lrb- 26,600ft -rrb- and is currently travelling at about 112kmph -lrb- 70mph -rrb- , his flight centre crew told the afp news agency .
he is expected to arrive in chile on wednesday before preparing to cross the andes mountains , a statement on his spirit of freedom website said .
reaction worry mr fossett , making his sixth attempt to be the first solo balloon circumnavigator , had earlier described his " most crucial day so far " in an e-mail to his supporters .
mr fossett has had good luck , but is now suffering from lack of sleep " you know my chances of a successful flight almost collapsed this morning -lrb- monday -rrb- when the weather changed , " he said .
" the margin for error was razor thin .
" i could n't sleep .
although i have warning alarms , i was worried that my reaction time when a rain squall and downdraft hit would not be quick enough . "
the balloon left western australia last wednesday for a round trip that , if successful , will have covered about 17,000 miles -lrb- 28,000 km -rrb- .
the voyage has been beset by fewer problems than mr fossett 's previous attempts , though lack of sleep is beginning to affect the balloonist .
fossett 's five earlier solo attempts ended with crash-landings in spots such as the coral sea off the north-east coast of australia and a cattle ranch in brazil .

"
the margin for error was razor thin " balloonist steve fossett mr fossett , a 58-year-old former stockbroker , is currently attempting to avoid storms around the south american continent after coming " perilously close " to smashing into the ocean as he battled storms in his latest attempt to fly a balloon around the world single-handedly .
the us adventurer had dropped low over the south pacific on monday in an attempt to avoid being caught up in thunderstorms , however he was almost driven into the sea .
mr fossett , 58 , used three gas burners to counter downdrafts during squalls east of new zealand but the balloon dipped to as low as 120 metres -lrb- 400 feet -rrb- above the waves .
he has since regained an altitude of about 8170m -lrb- 26,600ft -rrb- and is currently travelling at about 112kmph -lrb- 70mph -rrb- , his flight centre crew told the afp news agency .
he is expected to arrive in chile on wednesday before preparing to cross the andes mountains , a statement on his spirit of freedom website said .
reaction worry mr fossett , making his sixth attempt to be the first solo balloon circumnavigator , had earlier described his " most crucial day so far " in an e-mail to his supporters .
" you know my chances of a successful flight almost collapsed this morning -lrb- monday -rrb- when the weather changed , " he said .
" the margin for error was razor thin .
" i could n't sleep .
although i have warning alarms , i was worried that my reaction time when a rain squall and downdraft hit would not be quick enough . "
the balloon left western australia last wednesday for a round trip that , if successful , will have covered about 17,000 miles -lrb- 28,000 km -rrb- .
the voyage has been beset by fewer problems than mr fossett 's previous attempts , though lack of sleep is beginning to affect the balloonist .
fossett 's five earlier solo attempts ended with crash-landings in spots such as the coral sea off the north-east coast of australia and a cattle ranch in brazil .

future skycrapers may be built differently victims ' families have been invited for the first time to have their say into what is expected to be a multi-million dollar investigation .
despite the widely accepted notion that no skyscraper could have withstood a fuel-laden jet slicing into its core , relatives say there are still many technical questions to be answered .
for instance , they want to know if better fire-proofing materials and evacuation procedures could have resulted in more people escaping from the buildings .
regulations an initial report has found that automatic sprinklers were disabled by the impact of the crash , that exit stairwells were cut off and that much of the material used to protect critical steel beams had been dislodged .
the families have been pushing for a comprehensive investigation .
researchers from america 's national safety standards institute are now for waiting approval from congress so they can begin trying to find out precisely how and why the towers collapsed .
the investigation is expected to take two years and cost about $ 16m .

mr morris , 42 , is accused of killing three generations of the same family at a house in the swansea valley on 27 june 1999 .
mandy power , 34 , her daughters katie , 10 , and emily , eight , and her mother doris dawson , 80 , all died in what has been described by the prosecution as a " massacre " .
mr morris , of nearby craig cefn parc denies the murder charges in the case which began at swansea crown court in april .
the trial has heard mr morris had been having an occasional sexual relationship with divorcee mrs power .
but his team has claimed the " probable " murderer was the victim 's girlfriend , former police officer , alison lewis , who was previously arrested and questioned by south wales police but released without charge .
the prosecution claims mr morris turned killer after his sexual advances were eventually rejected by the mother-of-two .
the case against him is that he then set fire to the house to conceal the crime .
the four victims were beaten to death with an iron bar , each suffering head injuries .
all four were found in the house at kelvin road , clydach , by fire fighters called to deal with the blaze .
' stark choice ' the prosecution case has focused on mr morris 's gold chain , found at the scene - he admitted to owning the item despite originally denying it was his .
barristers on both sides summed up their cases last week .
peter rouch qc , for the defence , claimed the police 's case was " flawed and absurd " .
he said the defence case against relied on substance , not spin .
patrick harrington qc , for the prosecution , told court that if the victims could speak from the grave their voices would say " dai morris did it " .
on wednesday , he told jurors they had a stark choice to make between mr morris and alison lewis , who was never charged .
judge mr justice butterfield will begin his own summing up of the case in advance of the jurors ' retirement to consider their verdict .
his descriptions and directions are expected to last two days , while the jury could be sent out on tuesday or wednesday . ^ ^ back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- feedback -pipe- ©
