on the cards is a colourful golden jubilee extravaganza . those who view the monarchy in britain bemusedly as a quaint relic of the past may be in for a surprise as thousands of british subjects party in the streets this weekend to hail the queen 's 50 year reign .
what ’ s more - the celebration for the sovereign will not be confined to the united kingdom .
across the globe in countries as far away as greece , vietnam , the united states and the 54 commonwealth member states , festivities linked to the event will be held .
classic , pop and gospel in britain a variety of events and shows are planned to celebrate 50 years of the queen ’ s reign .
the celebrations will kick off with a classical concert at buckingham palace on saturday .
on sunday – keeping in mind that most of the nation will be glued to the television set for england ’ s opening world cup soccer game against sweden – the 76-year-old queen will attend a special church service .
monday evening will see a string of street parties across britain while some 12,000 people will rock in the gardens of the buckingham palace to the crooning of some of the biggest names representing the last five decades of pop music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock legend paul mccartney sir paul mcartney -lrb- photo -rrb- , eric clapton , cliff richard , tony bennet , ozzy osbourne , aretha franklin and ricky martin are just some of the artists who will be singing for the queen , accompanied by an orchestra from the royal academy of music .
celebrations all " decent " buckingham palace is taking care to avoid the event dissolving into an unruly foot-stomping spectacle .
" no swearing , shouting or profanities will be tolerated " says the list of rules for participants issued by the palace aimed at some of the more extreme singers such as heavy metal rocker ozzy osbourne .
the lighting of over 1,800 beacons across the uk , the channel islands , the commonwealth and throughout the world as far afield as antarctica will lend a sparkle to the golden jubilee celebrations .
the finale will see the queen herself lighting the touch paper to her very own beacon beside the queen victoria memorial outside the buckingham palace .
on tuesday , the last day of the celebrations , the queen will attend a thanksgiving service at london ’ s st paul ’ s cathedral followed by a gigantic parade of some 20,000 people to be led by a hell ’ s angels motorbike-rider and will include the world ’ s largest 5,000-strong gospel choir .
queen holds a special place for most the extensive celebrations for a largely symbolic sovereign might bewilder those outside the queen ’ s territory .
but within britain it seems , the queen still remains an endearing figurehead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen eizabeth the queen mother for many among the younger generations , the golden jubilee might just be an occasion to party , but a large proportion of british citizens apparently feel deep sympathy for the queen after this year ’ s death of her 101-year-old mother , the popular " queen mum " -lrb- photo -rrb- and sister princess margaret .
the queen - who took the throne as a young woman -lrb- photo -rrb- after the death of her father king george vi in 1952 - also remains popular especially among the working classes and older generations who clearly remember and treasure the great events of her 50 year rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many also view the queen of having had a rough life after she suffered embarrassment and humiliation over the break-up of three of her children ’ s marriages and the way the media blew up every peccadillo of her family into a scandal .
keeping abreast of the times but queen elizabeth herself has shown herself to be very much with the times and has made clear that the golden jubilee celebrations are not a time to just reminisce about the past .
in her online jubilee message published on the bbc site , the queen said , " i hope that this time of celebration in the united kingdom and across the commonwealth will not simply be an occasion to be nostalgic about the past .
i believe that , young or old , we have as much to look forward to with confidence and hope as we have to look back on with pride " .
in a rare gesture , the queen has also decided to visit a uk mosque and hindu , sikh and jewish groups for the first time in an effort to get to know her multi-cultural and multi-faith subjects in modern-day britain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the queen 's official golden jubilee site roundup of events , programmes , facts and a list of frequently asked questions on the golden jubilee celebrations .

on the cards is a colourful golden jubilee extravaganza . those who view the monarchy in britain bemusedly as a quaint relic of the past may be in for a surprise as thousands of british subjects party in the streets this weekend to hail the queen 's 50 year reign .
what ’ s more - the celebration for the sovereign will not be confined to the united kingdom .
across the globe in countries as far away as greece , vietnam , the united states and the 54 commonwealth member states , festivities linked to the event will be held .
classic , pop and gospel in britain a variety of events and shows are planned to celebrate 50 years of the queen ’ s reign .
the celebrations will kick off with a classical concert at buckingham palace on saturday .
on sunday – keeping in mind that most of the nation will be glued to the television set for england ’ s opening world cup soccer game against sweden – the 76-year-old queen will attend a special church service .
monday evening will see a string of street parties across britain while some 12,000 people will rock in the gardens of the buckingham palace to the crooning of some of the biggest names representing the last five decades of pop music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock legend paul mccartney sir paul mcartney -lrb- photo -rrb- , eric clapton , cliff richard , tony bennet , ozzy osbourne , aretha franklin and ricky martin are just some of the artists who will be singing for the queen , accompanied by an orchestra from the royal academy of music .
celebrations all " decent " buckingham palace is taking care to avoid the event dissolving into an unruly foot-stomping spectacle .
" no swearing , shouting or profanities will be tolerated " says the list of rules for participants issued by the palace aimed at some of the more extreme singers such as heavy metal rocker ozzy osbourne .
the lighting of over 1,800 beacons across the uk , the channel islands , the commonwealth and throughout the world as far afield as antarctica will lend a sparkle to the golden jubilee celebrations .
the finale will see the queen herself lighting the touch paper to her very own beacon beside the queen victoria memorial outside the buckingham palace .
on tuesday , the last day of the celebrations , the queen will attend a thanksgiving service at london ’ s st paul ’ s cathedral followed by a gigantic parade of some 20,000 people to be led by a hell ’ s angels motorbike-rider and will include the world ’ s largest 5,000-strong gospel choir .
queen holds a special place for most the extensive celebrations for a largely symbolic sovereign might bewilder those outside the queen ’ s territory .
but within britain it seems , the queen still remains an endearing figurehead .

the queen - who took the throne as a young woman -lrb- photo -rrb- after the death of her father king george vi in 1952 - also remains popular especially among the working classes and older generations who clearly remember and treasure the great events of her 50 year rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many also view the queen of having had a rough life after she suffered embarrassment and humiliation over the break-up of three of her children ’ s marriages and the way the media blew up every peccadillo of her family into a scandal .
keeping abreast of the times but queen elizabeth herself has shown herself to be very much with the times and has made clear that the golden jubilee celebrations are not a time to just reminisce about the past .
in her online jubilee message published on the bbc site , the queen said , " i hope that this time of celebration in the united kingdom and across the commonwealth will not simply be an occasion to be nostalgic about the past .
i believe that , young or old , we have as much to look forward to with confidence and hope as we have to look back on with pride " .

on the cards is a colourful golden jubilee extravaganza . those who view the monarchy in britain bemusedly as a quaint relic of the past may be in for a surprise as thousands of british subjects party in the streets this weekend to hail the queen 's 50 year reign .
what ’ s more - the celebration for the sovereign will not be confined to the united kingdom .
across the globe in countries as far away as greece , vietnam , the united states and the 54 commonwealth member states , festivities linked to the event will be held .
classic , pop and gospel in britain a variety of events and shows are planned to celebrate 50 years of the queen ’ s reign .
the celebrations will kick off with a classical concert at buckingham palace on saturday .
on sunday – keeping in mind that most of the nation will be glued to the television set for england ’ s opening world cup soccer game against sweden – the 76-year-old queen will attend a special church service .
monday evening will see a string of street parties across britain while some 12,000 people will rock in the gardens of the buckingham palace to the crooning of some of the biggest names representing the last five decades of pop music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock legend paul mccartney sir paul mcartney -lrb- photo -rrb- , eric clapton , cliff richard , tony bennet , ozzy osbourne , aretha franklin and ricky martin are just some of the artists who will be singing for the queen , accompanied by an orchestra from the royal academy of music .
celebrations all " decent " buckingham palace is taking care to avoid the event dissolving into an unruly foot-stomping spectacle .
" no swearing , shouting or profanities will be tolerated " says the list of rules for participants issued by the palace aimed at some of the more extreme singers such as heavy metal rocker ozzy osbourne .
the lighting of over 1,800 beacons across the uk , the channel islands , the commonwealth and throughout the world as far afield as antarctica will lend a sparkle to the golden jubilee celebrations .
the finale will see the queen herself lighting the touch paper to her very own beacon beside the queen victoria memorial outside the buckingham palace .
on tuesday , the last day of the celebrations , the queen will attend a thanksgiving service at london ’ s st paul ’ s cathedral followed by a gigantic parade of some 20,000 people to be led by a hell ’ s angels motorbike-rider and will include the world ’ s largest 5,000-strong gospel choir .
queen holds a special place for most the extensive celebrations for a largely symbolic sovereign might bewilder those outside the queen ’ s territory .
but within britain it seems , the queen still remains an endearing figurehead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen eizabeth the queen mother for many among the younger generations , the golden jubilee might just be an occasion to party , but a large proportion of british citizens apparently feel deep sympathy for the queen after this year ’ s death of her 101-year-old mother , the popular " queen mum " -lrb- photo -rrb- and sister princess margaret .
the queen - who took the throne as a young woman -lrb- photo -rrb- after the death of her father king george vi in 1952 - also remains popular especially among the working classes and older generations who clearly remember and treasure the great events of her 50 year rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many also view the queen of having had a rough life after she suffered embarrassment and humiliation over the break-up of three of her children ’ s marriages and the way the media blew up every peccadillo of her family into a scandal .

on the cards is a colourful golden jubilee extravaganza . those who view the monarchy in britain bemusedly as a quaint relic of the past may be in for a surprise as thousands of british subjects party in the streets this weekend to hail the queen 's 50 year reign .
what ’ s more - the celebration for the sovereign will not be confined to the united kingdom .
across the globe in countries as far away as greece , vietnam , the united states and the 54 commonwealth member states , festivities linked to the event will be held .
classic , pop and gospel in britain a variety of events and shows are planned to celebrate 50 years of the queen ’ s reign .
the celebrations will kick off with a classical concert at buckingham palace on saturday .
on sunday – keeping in mind that most of the nation will be glued to the television set for england ’ s opening world cup soccer game against sweden – the 76-year-old queen will attend a special church service .
monday evening will see a string of street parties across britain while some 12,000 people will rock in the gardens of the buckingham palace to the crooning of some of the biggest names representing the last five decades of pop music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock legend paul mccartney sir paul mcartney -lrb- photo -rrb- , eric clapton , cliff richard , tony bennet , ozzy osbourne , aretha franklin and ricky martin are just some of the artists who will be singing for the queen , accompanied by an orchestra from the royal academy of music .
celebrations all " decent " buckingham palace is taking care to avoid the event dissolving into an unruly foot-stomping spectacle .
" no swearing , shouting or profanities will be tolerated " says the list of rules for participants issued by the palace aimed at some of the more extreme singers such as heavy metal rocker ozzy osbourne .
the lighting of over 1,800 beacons across the uk , the channel islands , the commonwealth and throughout the world as far afield as antarctica will lend a sparkle to the golden jubilee celebrations .
the finale will see the queen herself lighting the touch paper to her very own beacon beside the queen victoria memorial outside the buckingham palace .
on tuesday , the last day of the celebrations , the queen will attend a thanksgiving service at london ’ s st paul ’ s cathedral followed by a gigantic parade of some 20,000 people to be led by a hell ’ s angels motorbike-rider and will include the world ’ s largest 5,000-strong gospel choir .
queen holds a special place for most the extensive celebrations for a largely symbolic sovereign might bewilder those outside the queen ’ s territory .
but within britain it seems , the queen still remains an endearing figurehead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen eizabeth the queen mother for many among the younger generations , the golden jubilee might just be an occasion to party , but a large proportion of british citizens apparently feel deep sympathy for the queen after this year ’ s death of her 101-year-old mother , the popular " queen mum " -lrb- photo -rrb- and sister princess margaret .
the queen - who took the throne as a young woman -lrb- photo -rrb- after the death of her father king george vi in 1952 - also remains popular especially among the working classes and older generations who clearly remember and treasure the great events of her 50 year rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many also view the queen of having had a rough life after she suffered embarrassment and humiliation over the break-up of three of her children ’ s marriages and the way the media blew up every peccadillo of her family into a scandal .
keeping abreast of the times but queen elizabeth herself has shown herself to be very much with the times and has made clear that the golden jubilee celebrations are not a time to just reminisce about the past .
in her online jubilee message published on the bbc site , the queen said , " i hope that this time of celebration in the united kingdom and across the commonwealth will not simply be an occasion to be nostalgic about the past .
i believe that , young or old , we have as much to look forward to with confidence and hope as we have to look back on with pride " .
in a rare gesture , the queen has also decided to visit a uk mosque and hindu , sikh and jewish groups for the first time in an effort to get to know her multi-cultural and multi-faith subjects in modern-day britain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the queen 's official golden jubilee site roundup of events , programmes , facts and a list of frequently asked questions on the golden jubilee celebrations .

us secretary of state colin powell told me that neither side would benefit from starting a nuclear war .

secretary of state powell said that if pakistan acts to stop militant incursions , then india should consider a resumption of dialogue and also should consider pulling its troops back from the confrontation line .

for one , mr powell was just in the region in january , and deputy secretary of state richard armitage will be there ahead of mr rumsfeld .
also , india and pakistan must implement confidence-building measures , especially in the nuclear arena , and mr rumsfeld as secretary of defence is suited to address these thorny issues .
mr rumsfeld also may present to both sides a sobering report commissioned by the us defence department outlining the devastation that would result from a nuclear war between india and pakistan .
he is also expected to discuss the situation in afghanistan .
the interim leader in afghanistan , hamid karzai , has said a war between india and pakistan would be a disaster for his country .
and of course , the us is concerned about the possibility of losing the use of military bases in pakistan for its operations in afghanistan and also about losing over flight rights so that its jets can fly over pakistan on their way to missions in afghanistan .
the diplomatic challenge the goal of us diplomacy is to show both sides that they have something to gain by not going to war .
for the indians , there must be clear evidence that pakistani support for violence in kashmir has ended .
and pakistan wants to see not just a withdrawal of indian troops but also a resumption of political dialogue with india .
the trick for the united states is to show the two sides the benefits of moderation while giving them enough to satisfy fiercely nationalist domestic opinion in the two countries .

in response to questions of whether the changes amounted to domestic spying , mr ashcroft said the new powers would only be used to detect and prevent terrorism .
but civil liberties groups denounced the expanded powers , and the announcement outraged some veterans of the protest movement against the vietnam war who were targets of fbi surveillance more than 30 years ago .
the abuses that have been alleged about the fbi decades ago would not be allowed us attorney general john ashcroft fbi agents will now be able to monitor people at any public event or place if they suspect a terrorist plot , and they do not need to seek approval from fbi headquarters .
however , mr ashcroft said that the fbi will not be allowed to develop files on anyone , and searches for information or evidence still will require a warrant approved by a judge .
it was the first change to the fbi 's investigative guidelines in 25 years .
the last changes came following the revelations of the fbi 's cointelpro programme aimed at political dissidents and dissident groups in the us .
" the abuses that have been alleged about the fbi decades ago would not be allowed , " mr ashcroft said .
' fishing expeditions ' the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- said the new powers would allow the fbi to go on " fishing expeditions " without a scintilla of evidence .
it added that the bush administration should instead investigate why us authorities failed to foresee the attacks .
before the new guidelines , -lsb- agents -rsb- could not do the kind of information gathering that you or i could do as private citizens roger pilon , cato institute " the government is rewarding failure , " said laura w murphy , director of the aclu 's washington national office .
" when the government fails - as it increasingly appears to have done before 11 september - the bush administration 's response is to give itself new powers rather than seriously investigating why the failures occurred , " she said .
the aclu warned that the new guidelines would allow the fbi to freely infiltrate mosques , churches and synagogues , to listen in on online chat rooms and read message boards , even if it has no evidence that a crime might be committed .
but roger pilon , vice-president of legal affairs at the libertarian cato institute says 11 september was a " wake-up call " .
he added that the excesses under j edgar hoover were illegal under the new investigative guidelines , as they were under the old guidelines , and that restrictions on the fbi put in place 25 years ago were excessive .
" -lsb- agents -rsb- could not do the kind of information gathering that you or i could do as private citizens , " he said .
fbi excesses burton caine is a law professor at temple university in philadelphia - in the 1960s and 1970s , he represented war protesters and draft dodgers .
the fbi monitored anti-war and civil rights protesters he remembers the fbi surveillance during a peaceful protest march in 1970 from city hall to independence hall in philadelphia .
they took the names of the marchers and the names of their organisations , he said , adding that he had clients that were the targets of fbi wiretaps .
" that gets about as close as you can get to scaring people just for exercising their civil rights , " he said .
" and you have ashcroft wanting to do it all over again . "
instead of expanding powers for the fbi , the bureau needs to become more efficient , and he is wary of expanding the bureau 's powers of surveillance .
" there is no doubt enemies are in our midst , " he said , but added that we rely on government to prevent terrorism not to spy on its people .

university officials say the change is needed to raise the standard of education at xinjiang university but uighur groups are condemning the change as a direct attack on their culture and identity .
for more than 50 years , xinjiang university has offered its students the choice of learning in chinese or uighur , the native tongue to most of the province 's muslim population .
but from this september that choice will end .
the dean of xinjiang university confirmed to the bbc that in future all first- and second-year courses will be taught exclusively in mandarin chinese .
the dean says the change is needed to raise the level of education of local uighur students who , he says , often fall far behind their han chinese classmates .
he says there are also few textbooks translated into uighur and that students who learn in mandarin have a better chance of getting a job when they graduate .
but uighur exile groups are calling the change an open attack on uighur culture .
more than half of xinjiang 's population are uighurs .
they are ethnically turkic and they have little affection for their chinese rulers .
exile groups say the change is part of a concerted campaign by the chinese government to stamp out nationalist sentiment among xinjiang 's uighur population .
they say the chinese government is using the 11 september attacks against the united states as a pretext to suppress all forms of dissent by the muslim population of xinjiang .

durham police assistant chief constable ron hogg is helping his japanese counterparts at the world cup .
speaking at the british embassy in tokyo , he reported that there had been no trouble and no arrests of england fans ahead of sunday 's match against sweden .
our intelligence is that known hooligans plan to stay away from the tournament assistant chief constable ron hogg he said : " we are very happy with the pragmatic response of the japanese police .
" i think they will act sensibly .
" they usually have a rigid view about the commission of offences , but i think they are using plenty of discretion , as we have asked . "
he illustrated the point with the case of english fans arguing over the cost of some food in tokyo .
" the japanese police intervened rapidly and the incident was soon settled to everyone 's satisfaction , " he said .
about 3,500 england fans have arrived in japan so far and that number is expected to double before the sweden match .
asst chief constable hogg said 22 people had been refused entry to japan and korea so far , 10 of them following information supplied by the british , the others by the local authorities acting alone .
unruly elements british police are also monitoring two bars in thailand where potential troublemakers , hoping to travel to japan , had gathered .
the durham police officer said they would not be allowed to make the journey .
some people are using circuitous routes , such as flying via moscow and hong kong , to try to get in , but still had to face thorough checks at the airports .
it emerged that banning orders in england had risen to 1,031 .
he said : " our intelligence is that known hooligans plan to stay away from the tournament .
" reasons for this included successful police operations in the past to turn hooligans back at uk ports and airports - only one person had been turned back in britain so far this time - and new powers given to the authorities since the disturbances which marred euro 2000 . "
however , he conceded that in hooliganism terms the tournament was " very low risk " .

durham police assistant chief constable ron hogg is helping his japanese counterparts at the world cup .
speaking at the british embassy in tokyo , he reported that there had been no trouble and no arrests of england fans ahead of sunday 's match against sweden . "
our intelligence is that known hooligans plan to stay away from the tournament " assistant chief constable ron hogg he said : " we are very happy with the pragmatic response of the japanese police .
" i think they will act sensibly .
" they usually have a rigid view about the commission of offences , but i think they are using plenty of discretion , as we have asked . "
he illustrated the point with the case of english fans arguing over the cost of some food in tokyo .
" the japanese police intervened rapidly and the incident was soon settled to everyone 's satisfaction , " he said .
about 3,500 england fans have arrived in japan so far and that number is expected to double before the sweden match .
asst chief constable hogg said 22 people had been refused entry to japan and korea so far , 10 of them following information supplied by the british , the others by the local authorities acting alone .
unruly elements british police are also monitoring two bars in thailand where potential troublemakers , hoping to travel to japan , had gathered .
the durham police officer said they would not be allowed to make the journey .
some people are using circuitous routes , such as flying via moscow and hong kong , to try to get in , but still had to face thorough checks at the airports .
it emerged that banning orders in england had risen to 1,031 .
he said : " our intelligence is that known hooligans plan to stay away from the tournament .
" reasons for this included successful police operations in the past to turn hooligans back at uk ports and airports - only one person had been turned back in britain so far this time - and new powers given to the authorities since the disturbances which marred euro 2000 . "
however , he conceded that in hooliganism terms the tournament was " very low risk " .
" it is not as easily accessible as belgium and holland , " he said .
" we all know there are unruly elements in the football community and we need longer term grassroots solutions . "

special forces opened fire during a night-time raid on a compound after believing themselves in danger , said lieutenant frank merriman , a spokesman for us central command .
one soldier had seen an unidentified fighter point a rocket-propelled grenade in his unit 's direction and his commander gave the order to fire , the spokesman said .
a bbc correspondent in kabul says the episode is an embarrassment to the us in a sensitive region of afghanistan and underlines the complexity of military operations there .
" the firefight , which lasted just a few moments , resulted in the deaths of three and the wounding of two , " said lieutenant merriman .
according to the us military , a combined force of more than 100 us special forces and afghan troops were approaching a walled compound in the village of khomar kalay , near the provincial capital gardez , in the early hours of friday .
as they searched the site for al-qaeda and taleban militants , they reportedly noticed several fighters taking up fighting positions inside .
at the same time , the military said , another group of 10 to 12 armed men came sprinting towards them in what appeared to be a flanking manoeuvre .
following the shooting , the 17 remaining afghan fighters surrendered and it turned out they were pro-government forces from a neighbouring province , logar .
more precautions a us spokesman in afghanistan , colonel roger king , said he was concerned about the loss of allied lives .
" efforts will be made to place co-ordination measures into effect to prevent similar occurrences in the future , " he said .
special forces have been working with allied afghan forces to hunt for militants around gardez and other areas near the pakistan border .
but the area is also home to feuding warlords and armed fighters loyal to them .
the bbc 's ian mcwilliam says this " friendly fire " incident is a deadly illustration of the difficulties of hunting remaining militants in this remote region .
a rebel warlord , padsha khan zadran , has been fighting to dislodge the province 's governor , compounding the difficulties .

the rowett assessment of childhood appetite and metabolism - known as rascal - will aim to determine why some children remain thin while others gain weight .
the project is being carried out by the rowett research institute in aberdeen which wants to enlist the help of families in the north east of scotland for the study .
it is known that childhood obesity carries on into adulthood and can cause serious health problems , such as diabetes .
there has been a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or obese children in the last 20 or 30 years .
however , it is not fully clear why some children stay thin while others pile on the pounds .
there is very little information on pre-school age children - although studies from the united states suggest eating habits developed in early years may last a lifetime .
rowett 's human nutrition unit in aberdeen now wants to recruit 200 families from the north east with children aged between two and four years old .
the study will examine factors such as food intake and physical activity .
the researchers hope this will help reveal early indicators of a child 's likelihood of becoming obese .

elderly or disabled people often give enduring power of attorney to a friend or relative to act on their behalf .
but several financial institutions currently refuse to let attorneys access all of their accounts and services .
the issue came to light when professor peter willetts , who holds an epa for his disabled father , tried to open a savings account with the internet bank smile .
his application was rejected .
the drc took on his case claiming the bank was in breach of current disability discrimination laws .
smile subsequently agreed to change its policy and settled with professor willetts out of court .
drc chief executive bob niven is delighted with the outcome : " the disability discrimination act clearly states that disabled people should have the same access to goods and services - including financial products - as non-disabled people .
with the number of older disabled people on the increase this is an issue banks and other service providers will have to face .
and as disabled people have an annual spending power of £ 40 billion pounds , this is a custom they can not afford to turn down . "
bbc radio 4 's money box programme has highlighted the issue of attorneys not being able to open certain bank accounts in the past .
money box contacted those banks and building societies who currently restrict access to ask if they would change their policies in the light of the drc 's involvement .
all but one told money box they would immediately review their procedures .
bristol and west , which does not allow customers who have an epa to open any of its ' direct access ' accounts said it saw no need to change its rules : " we believe that we do not discriminate against disabled people .
although epa is not available on our remotely operated direct accounts , it is available on accounts taken out via our branches .
we have no plans to make our remote accounts accessible to people who hold epa " when money box put this to bob niven of the drc on saturday 's programme , he said that it was difficult to reconcile what bristol and west had said with the law .

extra officers will be drafted in to stop motorists acting suspiciously and specific roads will be targeted throughout the bank holiday weekend .
the campaign coincides with the start of the world cup and chief inspector terry kellaher has warned football supporters to take care .
" we would urge people to show common sense in their drinking if driving after football matches .
" whilst there may be a relaxation of licensing hours there is no reduction in the drink drive limits , " he said .
this latest scheme will see forces throughout wide clamp down on the growing trend of drinking and drug driving .
the initiative has been running for years and has proved successful in the past . "
it may be difficult to arrange transport for your night out but imagine how difficult it will be to arrange it for a whole year or longer if you are disqualified " chief inspector terry kellaher chief inspector kellaher said : " we are vigilant at all times anyway , we do n't hold with this it 's christmas , lets have a drink driving campaign . "
" my view is that drink driving has increased across the board , people are n't just having one or two and taking a chance , the readings on breathalysers are much higher which is really disconcerting . "
extra money has been ploughed into the campaign by the force and roads in wrexham , flintshire and denbighshire have been earmarked for extra monitoring .
chief inspector kellaher added : " the message is quite simple - do not drink or use drugs and drive .
" it may be difficult to arrange transport for your night out but imagine how difficult it will be to arrange it for a whole year or longer if you are disqualified . "
the scheme begins on saturday at 0600 bst and ends 3 june 0600 bst .
