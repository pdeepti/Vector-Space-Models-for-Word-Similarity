the bosnia mission was immediately renewed .
but both sides have not left the dispute unscathed . the united nations has voted unanimously to exempt us peacekeepers from prosecution by the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- for a year – ending a fierce row with the us which threatened future peacekeeping operations across the globe .
the us , which regards the court as an affront to us sovereignty , has warned it would veto future peacekeeping missions wherever it believed us troops might be prosecuted .
the us ’ veto led to weeks of wrangling and pitted the united states against all 15 european union nations , and numerous other advocates of the international criminal court .
in the end , the us backed down from seeking permanent immunity , enabling the un to find a compromise .
resolution to an ongoing dispute the compromise , which was proposed last friday , fell short of bush administration ’ s demands for complete immunity , but saved future us peacekeeping missions including the mission in bosnia , which was immediatey renewed .
the resolution calls for a 12 month exemption in investigating or prosecuting un peacekeepers from countries which do not support the court , " if a case arises " .

" we think this is a sad day for the united nations " .
he said the court ’ s statutes required a threat to international peace and security before the security council could act and " we don ’ t think -lrb- that -rrb- had been established " .
the new court some 76 nations have ratified the 1988 rome treaty which enabled the international criminal court , and 139 nations have signed it .
the court is the first permanent court to try individuals for the world ’ s worst atrocities : war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .

the bosnia mission was immediately renewed .
but both sides have not left the dispute unscathed . the united nations has voted unanimously to exempt us peacekeepers from prosecution by the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- for a year – ending a fierce row with the us which threatened future peacekeeping operations across the globe .
the us , which regards the court as an affront to us sovereignty , has warned it would veto future peacekeeping missions wherever it believed us troops might be prosecuted .
the us ’ veto led to weeks of wrangling and pitted the united states against all 15 european union nations , and numerous other advocates of the international criminal court .
in the end , the us backed down from seeking permanent immunity , enabling the un to find a compromise .
resolution to an ongoing dispute the compromise , which was proposed last friday , fell short of bush administration ’ s demands for complete immunity , but saved future us peacekeeping missions including the mission in bosnia , which was immediatey renewed .
the resolution calls for a 12 month exemption in investigating or prosecuting un peacekeepers from countries which do not support the court , " if a case arises " .
the security council will have to renew this immunity on an annual basis , leaving the council still the option to remove this protection method .
" no detention of any american by the court " after meeting the compromise , us ambassador to the un , john negroponte , said the resolution offered a degree of protection but warned that the us government would never permit the detention of any american by the court .
" we can not accept a struture that may transform the political criticism of america ’ s world role into the basis for criminal trials of americans who have put their lives on the line for freedom " , he said .
but british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock was careful to add that the resolution was less sweeping than it appeared .
" there is no mention of blanket immunity .
what is being provided is a ‘ time out ’ " .
meanwhile , supporters of the new crime court expressed their disappointment with the compromise , which they say has set a bad precedent of security council interference in an internationally agreed treaty .
canada ’ s ambassador paul heinbecker said " we don ’ t think it ’ s in the mandate of the security council to interpret treaties that are negotiated somewhere else " .
" we think this is a sad day for the united nations " .
he said the court ’ s statutes required a threat to international peace and security before the security council could act and " we don ’ t think -lrb- that -rrb- had been established " .

the us , which regards the court as an affront to us sovereignty , has warned it would veto future peacekeeping missions wherever it believed us troops might be prosecuted .
the us ’ veto led to weeks of wrangling and pitted the united states against all 15 european union nations , and numerous other advocates of the international criminal court .
in the end , the us backed down from seeking permanent immunity , enabling the un to find a compromise .
resolution to an ongoing dispute the compromise , which was proposed last friday , fell short of bush administration ’ s demands for complete immunity , but saved future us peacekeeping missions including the mission in bosnia , which was immediatey renewed .

the us ’ veto led to weeks of wrangling and pitted the united states against all 15 european union nations , and numerous other advocates of the international criminal court .
in the end , the us backed down from seeking permanent immunity , enabling the un to find a compromise .
resolution to an ongoing dispute the compromise , which was proposed last friday , fell short of bush administration ’ s demands for complete immunity , but saved future us peacekeeping missions including the mission in bosnia , which was immediatey renewed .
the resolution calls for a 12 month exemption in investigating or prosecuting un peacekeepers from countries which do not support the court , " if a case arises " .
the security council will have to renew this immunity on an annual basis , leaving the council still the option to remove this protection method .
" no detention of any american by the court " after meeting the compromise , us ambassador to the un , john negroponte , said the resolution offered a degree of protection but warned that the us government would never permit the detention of any american by the court .
" we can not accept a struture that may transform the political criticism of america ’ s world role into the basis for criminal trials of americans who have put their lives on the line for freedom " , he said .
but british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock was careful to add that the resolution was less sweeping than it appeared .
" there is no mention of blanket immunity .
what is being provided is a ‘ time out ’ " .
meanwhile , supporters of the new crime court expressed their disappointment with the compromise , which they say has set a bad precedent of security council interference in an internationally agreed treaty .

the bosnia mission was immediately renewed .
but both sides have not left the dispute unscathed . the united nations has voted unanimously to exempt us peacekeepers from prosecution by the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- for a year – ending a fierce row with the us which threatened future peacekeeping operations across the globe .
the us , which regards the court as an affront to us sovereignty , has warned it would veto future peacekeeping missions wherever it believed us troops might be prosecuted .
the us ’ veto led to weeks of wrangling and pitted the united states against all 15 european union nations , and numerous other advocates of the international criminal court .
in the end , the us backed down from seeking permanent immunity , enabling the un to find a compromise .
resolution to an ongoing dispute the compromise , which was proposed last friday , fell short of bush administration ’ s demands for complete immunity , but saved future us peacekeeping missions including the mission in bosnia , which was immediatey renewed .
the resolution calls for a 12 month exemption in investigating or prosecuting un peacekeepers from countries which do not support the court , " if a case arises " .
the security council will have to renew this immunity on an annual basis , leaving the council still the option to remove this protection method .
" no detention of any american by the court " after meeting the compromise , us ambassador to the un , john negroponte , said the resolution offered a degree of protection but warned that the us government would never permit the detention of any american by the court .
" we can not accept a struture that may transform the political criticism of america ’ s world role into the basis for criminal trials of americans who have put their lives on the line for freedom " , he said .
but british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock was careful to add that the resolution was less sweeping than it appeared .

speakers at the london conference railed against the united states and said that president bush should stand trial as a war criminal .
among those to give speeches were leaders wanted in the us and the middle east for their alleged support of terrorism .
mainstream leaders stayed away from the meeting , insisting that the views expressed were not shared by the vast majority of muslims .
blackmailing the message from the conference was one of resentment towards the us and what was seen as the oppression being inflicted on muslims .
they are trying to shut me up abu hamza al-masri president bush 's war on terror , they said , was against islam and the west was blackmailing muslim states to arrest fundamentalists .
yasser al-sirri , who is facing extradition to the us for allegedly sending money to terrorists in afghanistan , complained about the treatment of prisoners captured by the american military in afghanistan and held in cuba .
al-sirri , who has also spent several months in belmarsh prison accused of links to al-qaeda , said : " we should put george bush on trial as a war criminal for committing these violations . "
armed struggles the meeting was also addressed by abu hamza al-masri , a cleric whose funds were frozen by the us treasury for his alleged membership in the islamic army of aden .
the group claimed responsibility for bombing the uss cole in yemen in october 2000 , during which 17 american sailors were killed .
al-masri , who lost his hands and left eye fighting in afghanistan and now preaches at finsbury park mosque in london , said the us government was spiteful .
he said : " they are trying to shut me up .
i am one of the people who speaks openly . "
the audience of 150 were also told that abu qutadah , who disappeared in february , was safe and that he believed victory was close at hands for muslims .
organisers of the meeting included the militant group al-muhajiroun , which has encouraged members to join armed struggles abroad .

he said : " no mainstream muslim organization will touch al-muhajiroun with a barge pole .

china accuses the us of fuelling tensions by francis markus bbc correspondent in shanghai there has so far been little reaction from china to a us defence department report accusing beijing of moving further away from peaceful reunification with taiwan and towards more coercive strategies .
but chinese leaders are likely to reject the allegation , arguing that what washington calls coerciveness is in fact the deterrents to stop what they view as a renegade province from declaring formal independence maintaining the delicate status quo across the taiwan strait remains a complex balancing act chinese leaders can often be seen on state television arguing that beijing has no choice but to deploy missiles along its coastline facing taiwan .
they affirm that the aim is to stop the island from moving inexorably away from reunification with mainland china and towards formal independence .
it is an anxiety that has been sharpened since chen shui-bian of the historically pro-independence democratic progressive party won taiwan 's presidency more than two years ago .
deterrent and it is this that is bound to shape the reaction in beijing to the pentagon report .
one academic whose thinking broadly reflects government views on the taiwan issue said that what washington views as coerciveness , beijing regards as deterrents .
he said that although china did not intend to use force to compel taiwan into reunification , the more beijing perceived the island as moving towards formal independence , the more it would have to step up what he called deterrent measures .
economic ties china also argues that washington is contributing to the military tension by its arms sales to taiwan , which the americans maintain are to defend the island against against attack by beijing .
but while such military debates rage on , china and taiwan are quietly pursuing ever-deepening economic contacts with investment from the island pouring into mainland projects .
they are also trying to explore ways of easing the restrictions on direct travel and communications between the two that have been in place at taiwan 's insistence for decades .
maintaining the delicate status quo across the taiwan strait remains a complex balancing act involving the two players at political , military and economic levels . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's francis markus " economic contacts are getting closer and closer " see also : 30 apr 02 -pipe- asia-pacific timeline : us-china relations 25 jan 02 -pipe- asia-pacific q & a : taiwan 's relations with china 06 mar 01 -pipe- asia-pacific military funding reflects china 's fears 02 may 02 -pipe- asia-pacific china 's hu warns us over taiwan 11 may 02 -pipe- asia-pacific taiwan firms get china opening 09 may 02 -pipe- asia-pacific taiwan 's chen offers china talks internet links : chinese government pentagon taiwan government information office the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : s korea subway inferno toll rises us plays down n korean threat thai pm says officials peddling drugs australia refuses to lift bali warning chinese official vows to end corruption japanese emperor back to work leatherbacks ' extinct in 30 years ' new project to demine tajikistan links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

the 22-year-old trainee solicitor from birmingham reacted with shock at the news .
" it 's all over guys - and i 'm gutted , " he said .
more than one million viewers voted on friday - and following the bookies ' predictions , pj 's fellow nominee kate lawler remains inside .
kate , 22 , an it administrator from kent , survived despite packing her things in anticipation of going .
pj , the seventh person to be evicted , had regained his composure when he was allowed out of the house at 2200 .
speaking to davinia mccall after a raucous welcome from fans , he said of his time in big brother house : " i loved it . "
and he denied having any sexual relationship with jade .
" nothing at all .
i promise you now .
" there was one thing i had in mind from the very start - my sister 's watching this " he said .
friday 's eviction followed a morning of sunbathing at the house and the discovery of a frog in the garden , which the housemates adopted .
alex even asked big brother for frog food .
but big brother contacted the rspca and said that the housemates could not keep the animal .
during the day pj said he was nervous about the reception he would receive if he left - and admitted to expecting some boos from the crowd .
but , unlike kate , pj did not bother to pack before the votes were counted .
pj and kate were nominated after they drew the short straws in a game on saturday , in a change to the usual nomination process .
the six remaining housemates were given the chance to watch video messages from their friends and families in exchange for being put up for eviction .
kate 's popularity inside and outside the house has increased since the start of the third big brother series in may .
she has played the joker among the housemates and refused to talk ill of any one of them behind their back .
friday 's vote may also have been influenced by a desire to see if romance blossoms between her and model alex sibley , 23 , from hornchurch , essex .
favourite there have been signs that the pair have become increasingly close , especially since the departure last week of adele roberts .
adele , 23 , a personal assistant and dj from southport , left the house after receiving more votes than fellow nominee , dental nurse jade goody , from bermondsey , south london .

the 22-year-old trainee solicitor from birmingham reacted with shock at the news .
" it 's all over guys - and i 'm gutted , " he said .
more than one million viewers voted on friday - and following the bookies ' predictions , pj 's fellow nominee kate lawler remains inside .
the trainee solicitor got a hug from his mum kate , 22 , an it administrator from kent , survived despite packing her things in anticipation of going .
pj , the seventh person to be evicted , had regained his composure when he was allowed out of the house at 2200 .
speaking to davinia mccall after a raucous welcome from fans , he said of his time in big brother house : " i loved it . "
and he denied having any sexual relationship with jade .
" nothing at all .
i promise you now .
" there was one thing i had in mind from the very start - my sister 's watching this " he said .
kate lawler lives to fight another day friday 's eviction followed a morning of sunbathing at the house and the discovery of a frog in the garden , which the housemates adopted .
alex even asked big brother for frog food .
but big brother contacted the rspca and said that the housemates could not keep the animal .
during the day pj said he was nervous about the reception he would receive if he left - and admitted to expecting some boos from the crowd .
but , unlike kate , pj did not bother to pack before the votes were counted .
pj and kate were nominated after they drew the short straws in a game on saturday , in a change to the usual nomination process .
the six remaining housemates were given the chance to watch video messages from their friends and families in exchange for being put up for eviction .
kate 's popularity inside and outside the house has increased since the start of the third big brother series in may .
she has played the joker among the housemates and refused to talk ill of any one of them behind their back .
friday 's vote may also have been influenced by a desire to see if romance blossoms between her and model alex sibley , 23 , from hornchurch , essex .
favourite there have been signs that the pair have become increasingly close , especially since the departure last week of adele roberts .
jonny regan : may still be on course to win adele , 23 , a personal assistant and dj from southport , left the house after receiving more votes than fellow nominee , dental nurse jade goody , from bermondsey , south london .

beijing is modernising its military to make possible a forcible reunification with taiwan , which it regards as a renegade province , the report says .
preparing for a potential conflict in the taiwan strait is the primary driver for china 's military modernisation pentagon report as well as assessing china 's military power , the annual report also focuses on the country 's ability to threaten other powers in the asia-pacific region .
correspondents say this is the first time such a report has questioned china 's commitment to a peaceful settlement with taiwan and highlights the threat it poses to other neighbours .
the pentagon is required to submit to congress an assessment of china 's military every year .
but , because of the change in administration , this is the first report since may 2000 - in other words , the first under the bush administration .
' credible military options ' the report states that the primary driver for china 's military modernisation is " preparing for a potential conflict in the taiwan strait " .
it adds : " while it professes a preference for resolving the taiwan issue peacefully , beijing is also seeking credible military options . "

it adds that this spending could increase three or four-fold by 2020 .
the pentagon is also concerned by china 's recent purchase from russia of two sovremenny-class destroyers , which are armed with missiles that could sink an american aircraft carrier .
" the ambitious military modernisation casts a cloud over its declared preference for resolving differences with taiwan through peaceful means , " the report says .
beijing fears taiwan 's permanent separation from the mainland may allow the us to divide and westernise the island , according to the report .
mixed signals rick fischer , a china analyst at the jamestown foundation in washington told the bbc : " war on the taiwan strait is in nobody 's interest , and this is the direction beijing is headed if it does not back off and concentrate on developing peaceful economic relations with taiwan . "
america 's particular concerns are the build-up of short-range ballistic missiles opposite taiwan .
it is also concerned about china 's naval expansion , including modern submarines which could be used to blockade taiwan , and russian-built destroyers armed with missiles specifically designed to take on us aircraft-carriers .
president bush came to office describing china as a strategic competitor , and there was a tense diplomatic stand-off last year when a chinese fighter collided with a us surveillance plane .
but the bbc 's pentagon correspondent , nick childs , says that the signals on us-chinese relations since have been mixed .
there have been signs of co-operation on the us-led campaign against the al-qaeda network since 11 september , and a senior us defence official was in china last month to look at ways of improving military ties .
but , our correspondent says , it is clear the pentagon remains very wary of china 's military modernisation plans . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's francis markus " economic contacts are getting closer and closer " see also : 13 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific china-taiwan : coercion or deterrence ? 11 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific china 's military on parade 30 apr 02 -pipe- asia-pacific timeline : us-china relations 25 jan 02 -pipe- asia-pacific q & a : taiwan 's relations with china 06 mar 01 -pipe- asia-pacific military funding reflects china 's fears 02 may 02 -pipe- asia-pacific china 's hu warns us over taiwan 20 feb 02 -pipe- asia-pacific analysis : neither enemies nor friends internet links : chinese government pentagon the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : s korea subway inferno toll rises us plays down n korean threat thai pm says officials peddling drugs australia refuses to lift bali warning chinese official vows to end corruption japanese emperor back to work leatherbacks ' extinct in 30 years ' new project to demine tajikistan links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

for the last five years , talks between indian officials and the leaders of the national socialist council of nagaland -lrb- nscn -rrb- have been held outside india in countries such as thailand and the netherlands .
the nscn chairman , issac chisi swu , told the bbc that he will come to india to continue talks with delhi .
the other senior leaders of the nscn , including its general secretary , thuingalent muivah , will also accompany mr swu .
the talks between the two sides , he said , will now be held in india , and the senior leaders of the nscn will probably base themselves in delhi .
charges dropped mr swu said the indian government had dropped all cases against the nscn leaders , clearing the way for them to return to india .
the nscn started negotiating with india in 1997 after four decades of armed conflict .
progress was , however , slow and often marred by mistrust .
but observers say the decision of the nscn leaders to come to delhi for negotiations indicates that they are at ease with the indian leadership and are more confident than ever before about a breakthrough in the talks .
the two sides have also decided to extend the ceasefire by another year .
the nscn has been fighting for several decades for a homeland for ethnic nagas in north-east india in the area that borders burma .

the un security council voted unanimously for the 12-month exemption - to be renewed annually - to end a bitter row threatening peacekeeping operations . "
washington got only a temporary reprieve of dubious legality and a strong taste of global outrage " human rights watch canada 's ambassador to the un , paul heinbecker , said the security council had exceeded its powers .
but america warned of " serious consequences " if the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- ever arrested a member of the us military .
the bbc 's un correspondent says the new resolution will have little practical effect on the court 's work .
but he says it has set the bad precedent of security council interference in an internationally agreed treaty .
' not in mandate ' ambassador heinbecker told reporters : " we think this is a sad day for the united nations .
" we do n't think it 's in the mandate of the security council to interpret treaties that are negotiated somewhere else . "
the compromise resolution permitting the one-year exemption in investigating or prosecuting peacekeepers applies to countries , like the us , that do not support the icc .
but the possibility that the exemption would not be renewed brought a stiff warning from us ambassador to the un , john negroponte .
" we can not accept a structure that may transform the political criticism of america 's world role into the basis for criminal trials of americans who have put their lives on the line for freedom , " he said .
" should the icc eventually seek to detain any american , the united states would regard this as illegitimate .
" no nation should underestimate our commitment to protect our citizens . "
president bush 's administration had been threatening to veto all future un peacekeeping missions if the american military was not granted permanent immunity from the icc .
after the compromise security council resolution was passed , the un 's peacekeeping mandate in bosnia was immediately renewed .
' time out ' human rights groups attacked the deal .
" for all its arm-twisting , washington got only a temporary reprieve of dubious legality and a strong taste of global outrage , " said richard dicker of human rights watch .
the british ambassador at the un , sir jeremy greenstock , defended the deal .
he said it would offer a " time out for the right action to be taken by the member state whose nationals are accused or indicted " .
and france 's jean-david levitte said the compromise was " absolutely in line with the statute of rome " which set up the icc .
the icc is the first permanent court to try war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
the rome statute entered into force on 1 july and the court is expected to begin processing charges in the hague in about a year .
