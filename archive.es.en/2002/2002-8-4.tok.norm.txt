in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

it hopes that will propel the country forward on its path to the european union . in the face of stiff opposition mainly from the nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- , pro-eu forces in the turkish parliament rushed a far-reaching reform package on early saturday morning .
the package , which was passed after a marathon debate lasting close to 22 hours , includes measures ending punishments for criticism of the armed forces and other pillars of the turkish establishment , outlawing organ and people smuggling , easing restrictions on foreign associations working in turkey as well as on the kurdish language .
no more capital punishment but perhaps the most significant reform foreseen in the package is the abolishment of the death penalty from turkey ’ s civil code , except in times of war or a near war .
turkey is the only country in the european council that has the death penalty enshrined in its constitution , though it has not implemented it for the past 18 years .
the removal of the death penalty will be a relief to turkey ’ s most prominent prisoner – the guerilla leader of the separatist organisation , kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , abdullah ocalan .
just three years ago , a fierce debate broke out in turkey over executing the kurdish leader , who is blamed for more than 30,000 deaths in conflict with security forces .

it allows the kurds television and radio broadcasts in the kurdish language as long as they follow constitutional principles and do not incite violence .
expatriot kurds living in europe have been broadcasting via satellite to turkey for years , much to the anger of the turkish state , which routinely accuses the channels of acting as mouthpieces for the separatist rebels of the pkk .
the reforms also enable private schools to teach in languages other than turkish on the condition that they do not violate the constitution .
the strongest opposition to key reforms empowering the kurdish population has come from the mhp , who fear that allowing freedoms for the kurdish language might encourage armed seperatism in turkey ’ s kurdish-dominated south-east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit world summit opens with eu , us at odds on the green road from rio to johannesburg cooking with the sun germany -pipe- 04.08.2002 steering environmental issues back on the political agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer is confident about the success of the earth summit in johannesburg klaus töpfer has directed the u.n. environmental program since 1998 .
in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

it hopes that will propel the country forward on its path to the european union . in the face of stiff opposition mainly from the nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- , pro-eu forces in the turkish parliament rushed a far-reaching reform package on early saturday morning .
the package , which was passed after a marathon debate lasting close to 22 hours , includes measures ending punishments for criticism of the armed forces and other pillars of the turkish establishment , outlawing organ and people smuggling , easing restrictions on foreign associations working in turkey as well as on the kurdish language .
no more capital punishment but perhaps the most significant reform foreseen in the package is the abolishment of the death penalty from turkey ’ s civil code , except in times of war or a near war .
turkey is the only country in the european council that has the death penalty enshrined in its constitution , though it has not implemented it for the past 18 years .
the removal of the death penalty will be a relief to turkey ’ s most prominent prisoner – the guerilla leader of the separatist organisation , kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , abdullah ocalan .
just three years ago , a fierce debate broke out in turkey over executing the kurdish leader , who is blamed for more than 30,000 deaths in conflict with security forces .

expatriot kurds living in europe have been broadcasting via satellite to turkey for years , much to the anger of the turkish state , which routinely accuses the channels of acting as mouthpieces for the separatist rebels of the pkk .
the reforms also enable private schools to teach in languages other than turkish on the condition that they do not violate the constitution .
the strongest opposition to key reforms empowering the kurdish population has come from the mhp , who fear that allowing freedoms for the kurdish language might encourage armed seperatism in turkey ’ s kurdish-dominated south-east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit world summit opens with eu , us at odds on the green road from rio to johannesburg cooking with the sun germany -pipe- 04.08.2002 steering environmental issues back on the political agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer is confident about the success of the earth summit in johannesburg klaus töpfer has directed the u.n. environmental program since 1998 .
in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "

in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.08.2002 turkey to abolish the death penalty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landmark vote - turkey 's ailing prime minister bulent ecevit , left , and his new deputy and foreign minister sukru sina gurel in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .
it hopes that will propel the country forward on its path to the european union . in the face of stiff opposition mainly from the nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- , pro-eu forces in the turkish parliament rushed a far-reaching reform package on early saturday morning .
the package , which was passed after a marathon debate lasting close to 22 hours , includes measures ending punishments for criticism of the armed forces and other pillars of the turkish establishment , outlawing organ and people smuggling , easing restrictions on foreign associations working in turkey as well as on the kurdish language .
no more capital punishment but perhaps the most significant reform foreseen in the package is the abolishment of the death penalty from turkey ’ s civil code , except in times of war or a near war .
turkey is the only country in the european council that has the death penalty enshrined in its constitution , though it has not implemented it for the past 18 years .
the removal of the death penalty will be a relief to turkey ’ s most prominent prisoner – the guerilla leader of the separatist organisation , kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , abdullah ocalan .
just three years ago , a fierce debate broke out in turkey over executing the kurdish leader , who is blamed for more than 30,000 deaths in conflict with security forces .
more rights and freedom to the kurds the reform packet also deals with another sensitive issue – raising cultural rights for the country ’ s minority kurdish population and giving them increased freedom of expression .
it allows the kurds television and radio broadcasts in the kurdish language as long as they follow constitutional principles and do not incite violence .
expatriot kurds living in europe have been broadcasting via satellite to turkey for years , much to the anger of the turkish state , which routinely accuses the channels of acting as mouthpieces for the separatist rebels of the pkk .
the reforms also enable private schools to teach in languages other than turkish on the condition that they do not violate the constitution .
the strongest opposition to key reforms empowering the kurdish population has come from the mhp , who fear that allowing freedoms for the kurdish language might encourage armed seperatism in turkey ’ s kurdish-dominated south-east .
hoping to get into brussels ' good books reformists in turkey are hoping that brussels sees the historic passing of the reform package as an important step towards turkey fulfilling the criteria for joining the european union .
they aim to convince brussels to set a date for membership talks later this year although the eu could likely prefer to see how the reforms are implemented .
in the past turkey has run into problems with brussels after defaulting on promises to implement reforms .
it has also often come under fire from international humanitarian organisations and the un for its poor human rights record .
but there were few doubting voices in the turkish media today as most newspapers expressed unrestrained delight at the landmark passing of the reforms .
" europe , we ’ re coming ! " was milliyet newspaper ’ s headline , while the sabah newspaper bore the front page banner headline " thank you .
the death penalty , the main obstacle for eu membership is abolished with a historic vote " , it proclaimed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey plods on long road to eu time is running out for turkey .
by march 19 , the country has to comply with criteria for accession to the european union , failing which it jeopardises its chances of being accepted to the eu fold .

that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .

in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .

but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit world summit opens with eu , us at odds on the green road from rio to johannesburg cooking with the sun germany -pipe- 04.08.2002 steering environmental issues back on the political agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer is confident about the success of the earth summit in johannesburg klaus töpfer has directed the u.n. environmental program since 1998 .
in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "

in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .

and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .

it hopes that will propel the country forward on its path to the european union . in the face of stiff opposition mainly from the nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- , pro-eu forces in the turkish parliament rushed a far-reaching reform package on early saturday morning .
the package , which was passed after a marathon debate lasting close to 22 hours , includes measures ending punishments for criticism of the armed forces and other pillars of the turkish establishment , outlawing organ and people smuggling , easing restrictions on foreign associations working in turkey as well as on the kurdish language .
no more capital punishment but perhaps the most significant reform foreseen in the package is the abolishment of the death penalty from turkey ’ s civil code , except in times of war or a near war .
turkey is the only country in the european council that has the death penalty enshrined in its constitution , though it has not implemented it for the past 18 years .
the removal of the death penalty will be a relief to turkey ’ s most prominent prisoner – the guerilla leader of the separatist organisation , kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , abdullah ocalan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit world summit opens with eu , us at odds on the green road from rio to johannesburg cooking with the sun germany -pipe- 04.08.2002 steering environmental issues back on the political agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer is confident about the success of the earth summit in johannesburg klaus töpfer has directed the u.n. environmental program since 1998 .
in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .

but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .

it hopes that will propel the country forward on its path to the european union . in the face of stiff opposition mainly from the nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- , pro-eu forces in the turkish parliament rushed a far-reaching reform package on early saturday morning .
the package , which was passed after a marathon debate lasting close to 22 hours , includes measures ending punishments for criticism of the armed forces and other pillars of the turkish establishment , outlawing organ and people smuggling , easing restrictions on foreign associations working in turkey as well as on the kurdish language .
no more capital punishment but perhaps the most significant reform foreseen in the package is the abolishment of the death penalty from turkey ’ s civil code , except in times of war or a near war .
turkey is the only country in the european council that has the death penalty enshrined in its constitution , though it has not implemented it for the past 18 years .
the removal of the death penalty will be a relief to turkey ’ s most prominent prisoner – the guerilla leader of the separatist organisation , kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , abdullah ocalan .
just three years ago , a fierce debate broke out in turkey over executing the kurdish leader , who is blamed for more than 30,000 deaths in conflict with security forces .

it allows the kurds television and radio broadcasts in the kurdish language as long as they follow constitutional principles and do not incite violence .
expatriot kurds living in europe have been broadcasting via satellite to turkey for years , much to the anger of the turkish state , which routinely accuses the channels of acting as mouthpieces for the separatist rebels of the pkk .
the reforms also enable private schools to teach in languages other than turkish on the condition that they do not violate the constitution .
the strongest opposition to key reforms empowering the kurdish population has come from the mhp , who fear that allowing freedoms for the kurdish language might encourage armed seperatism in turkey ’ s kurdish-dominated south-east .

in the past turkey has run into problems with brussels after defaulting on promises to implement reforms .

it hopes that will propel the country forward on its path to the european union . in the face of stiff opposition mainly from the nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- , pro-eu forces in the turkish parliament rushed a far-reaching reform package on early saturday morning .
the package , which was passed after a marathon debate lasting close to 22 hours , includes measures ending punishments for criticism of the armed forces and other pillars of the turkish establishment , outlawing organ and people smuggling , easing restrictions on foreign associations working in turkey as well as on the kurdish language .
no more capital punishment but perhaps the most significant reform foreseen in the package is the abolishment of the death penalty from turkey ’ s civil code , except in times of war or a near war .
turkey is the only country in the european council that has the death penalty enshrined in its constitution , though it has not implemented it for the past 18 years .
the removal of the death penalty will be a relief to turkey ’ s most prominent prisoner – the guerilla leader of the separatist organisation , kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , abdullah ocalan .
just three years ago , a fierce debate broke out in turkey over executing the kurdish leader , who is blamed for more than 30,000 deaths in conflict with security forces .

it allows the kurds television and radio broadcasts in the kurdish language as long as they follow constitutional principles and do not incite violence .
expatriot kurds living in europe have been broadcasting via satellite to turkey for years , much to the anger of the turkish state , which routinely accuses the channels of acting as mouthpieces for the separatist rebels of the pkk .
the reforms also enable private schools to teach in languages other than turkish on the condition that they do not violate the constitution .
the strongest opposition to key reforms empowering the kurdish population has come from the mhp , who fear that allowing freedoms for the kurdish language might encourage armed seperatism in turkey ’ s kurdish-dominated south-east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit world summit opens with eu , us at odds on the green road from rio to johannesburg cooking with the sun germany -pipe- 04.08.2002 steering environmental issues back on the political agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer is confident about the success of the earth summit in johannesburg klaus töpfer has directed the u.n. environmental program since 1998 .
in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.08.2002 turkey to abolish the death penalty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landmark vote - turkey 's ailing prime minister bulent ecevit , left , and his new deputy and foreign minister sukru sina gurel in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .
it hopes that will propel the country forward on its path to the european union . in the face of stiff opposition mainly from the nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- , pro-eu forces in the turkish parliament rushed a far-reaching reform package on early saturday morning .
the package , which was passed after a marathon debate lasting close to 22 hours , includes measures ending punishments for criticism of the armed forces and other pillars of the turkish establishment , outlawing organ and people smuggling , easing restrictions on foreign associations working in turkey as well as on the kurdish language .
no more capital punishment but perhaps the most significant reform foreseen in the package is the abolishment of the death penalty from turkey ’ s civil code , except in times of war or a near war .
turkey is the only country in the european council that has the death penalty enshrined in its constitution , though it has not implemented it for the past 18 years .
the removal of the death penalty will be a relief to turkey ’ s most prominent prisoner – the guerilla leader of the separatist organisation , kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , abdullah ocalan .
just three years ago , a fierce debate broke out in turkey over executing the kurdish leader , who is blamed for more than 30,000 deaths in conflict with security forces .
more rights and freedom to the kurds the reform packet also deals with another sensitive issue – raising cultural rights for the country ’ s minority kurdish population and giving them increased freedom of expression .
it allows the kurds television and radio broadcasts in the kurdish language as long as they follow constitutional principles and do not incite violence .
expatriot kurds living in europe have been broadcasting via satellite to turkey for years , much to the anger of the turkish state , which routinely accuses the channels of acting as mouthpieces for the separatist rebels of the pkk .
the reforms also enable private schools to teach in languages other than turkish on the condition that they do not violate the constitution .
the strongest opposition to key reforms empowering the kurdish population has come from the mhp , who fear that allowing freedoms for the kurdish language might encourage armed seperatism in turkey ’ s kurdish-dominated south-east .
hoping to get into brussels ' good books reformists in turkey are hoping that brussels sees the historic passing of the reform package as an important step towards turkey fulfilling the criteria for joining the european union .
they aim to convince brussels to set a date for membership talks later this year although the eu could likely prefer to see how the reforms are implemented .
in the past turkey has run into problems with brussels after defaulting on promises to implement reforms .
it has also often come under fire from international humanitarian organisations and the un for its poor human rights record .
but there were few doubting voices in the turkish media today as most newspapers expressed unrestrained delight at the landmark passing of the reforms .
" europe , we ’ re coming ! " was milliyet newspaper ’ s headline , while the sabah newspaper bore the front page banner headline " thank you .
the death penalty , the main obstacle for eu membership is abolished with a historic vote " , it proclaimed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey plods on long road to eu time is running out for turkey .

in an interview with dw-world , germany ’ s former environmental minister explains how environmental issues can get back on the world ’ s political agenda . at the end of august the largest international conference on the environment will convene in johannesburg , south africa .
it is the most important meeting of environmentalists and politicians since rio in 1992 .
in the weeks leading up to the world summit on sustainable development , environmental leaders around the world will be reflecting on many of the issues on the conference ’ s agenda .
but many are also asking what the summit will actually achieve and how much of an impact it will have on the way countries deal with their environment .
klaus töpfer , the director for the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , is an outspoken proponent of the conference .
the former environmental minister under helmut kohl ’ s christian democrats -lrb- 1994-1998 -rrb- is convinced that - regardless of changing political parties and international conflicts - environmental issues should remain an integral part of global policy-making discussions .
in an interview with dw-world , töpfer expressed his firm belief in the success of the johannesburg summit .
interview with klaus töpfer : in the aftermath of september 11th , the focus of world politics is on the fight against terror and on security .
how can environmental issues be brought back on the agenda of international politics ?
environmental politics are an absolute necessity in the fight against those conflicts .
we are aware that to overcome poverty – the most toxic element in the world – we need to combine economic development with environmental considerations .
we at the united nations environmental program therefore decided to change our motto to " unep : environment for development " .
we believe that environment is instrumental in development .
and development , on the other hand , is instrumental in decreasing tensions – the conflicts in the world .
therefore , more than ever , this johannesburg summit is important for the world .
and i sincerely believe that this summit is something like a peace summit in that we have to do whatever is possible to make it a success .
how could the conference in johannesburg achieve these goals in concrete terms ?
rio de janeiro 10 years ago gave us clear and wonderfully visionary texts and declarations .
unfortunately , it was not clear enough how to implement these goals .
and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not of another declaration .
that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .

that means we need concrete targets , concrete timetables and concrete conclusions with regard to the means of implementation .
one example is the need for developing renewable energies .
let ’ s make a concrete target out of it and say 10 percent , 12 percent , 15 percent of energy consumed worldwide should come from renewable sources in the next 10 years .
this is a concrete target and timetable .
if we agree on this , then johannesburg really makes a difference .
are these targets realistic ?
i think so , yes .
we have to be realistic .
what is really missing in this world of globalization right now is accountability and responsibility .
i don ’ t want to go into day-to-day politics .
but you see the decrease of credibility , for example , in the economic field .
you see all the developments now on the stock markets , that people are convinced that this is unaccountable behavior .
so it ’ s important that we go into this summit saying : this is not only the far-reaching target we need .
but this is also achievable .
and we want to monitor it , we want to benchmark it .
then people can say : they ’ re not only going to another conference , another summit where they spend a lot of money and wield a lot of papers .
i really believe more than ever that in johannesburg it ’ s the clear signal that ’ s important : don ’ t be visionary alone , do it as well , but link it with concrete and achievable targets .
don ’ t you sometimes become frustrated in light of the u.s. administration ’ s policy , which doesn ’ t seem to really care about environmental issues ?
frustration is not a reaction .
frustration is also not a chance to solve problems .
we have to analyze the problems and ask what is possible to do .
and the first and foremost : do your " homework " .
it ’ s good , for example , that the eu ratified the kyoto protocol .
that this was done in japan , as well , and that now russia has also started the ratification process , so that the kyoto protocol can enter into force .
we see in the u.s. that there ’ s much more going on than one or the other is aware of .
you can see differences between the different states .
if you go , for example , to california , you ’ ll see what is happening there , and in other states as well , and that ’ s fascinating , that ’ s quite forward-looking .
and also if you see this on the federal level , there is a new stimulation for renewable energy , there is a new stimulation for increasing energy efficiency .
all this seems to me not to be enough .
but they are steps in the right direction and i sincerely hope that it will be very clear in the near future that doing this does not weaken the economic basis , but strengthens it .
and which means of control and sanctions should be put in place to make governments respect the environment and obey international environmental agreements ?
indeed , we have to do much more in this field .
we have quite a lot of different conventions , legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
we have protocols – legally binding , ratified by parliaments .
but the mechanisms of enforcement and compliance are weak .
there was a lot of discussion in the kyoto protocol .
there is a solution , which is better than what one or the other expected .
but we have to do more in this field .
so let ’ s go further in globalizing these control instruments .
historical and cultural traditions lead to different approaches to environmental care .
japan , for example , doesn ’ t want to cease whale hunting because it regards whale fishing as part of its cultural tradition .
how could a common denominator be defined in international environmental politics ?
first and foremost , it ’ s a very important and a good development that more cultural diversity is integrated into the topic of sustainable development .
people don ’ t want to be linked with their language ; they want to be linked with their behavior , their traditions .
if you see the development of indigenous knowledge , how can we handle this wisdom of indigenous people with regard to medicine and the knowledge of biodiversity ?
these are positive signals that cultural diversity is a stabilizing factor for globalization and exactly this is necessary .
i ’ m very happy that unep can have an event in johannesburg under the title " cultural diversity , biodiversity and sustainable development . "
and i am extremely happy that president chirac and other presidents accepted our invitation and we will do a lot in this direction .

it hopes that will propel the country forward on its path to the european union . in the face of stiff opposition mainly from the nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- , pro-eu forces in the turkish parliament rushed a far-reaching reform package on early saturday morning .
the package , which was passed after a marathon debate lasting close to 22 hours , includes measures ending punishments for criticism of the armed forces and other pillars of the turkish establishment , outlawing organ and people smuggling , easing restrictions on foreign associations working in turkey as well as on the kurdish language .
no more capital punishment but perhaps the most significant reform foreseen in the package is the abolishment of the death penalty from turkey ’ s civil code , except in times of war or a near war .
turkey is the only country in the european council that has the death penalty enshrined in its constitution , though it has not implemented it for the past 18 years .
the removal of the death penalty will be a relief to turkey ’ s most prominent prisoner – the guerilla leader of the separatist organisation , kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , abdullah ocalan .
just three years ago , a fierce debate broke out in turkey over executing the kurdish leader , who is blamed for more than 30,000 deaths in conflict with security forces .
more rights and freedom to the kurds the reform packet also deals with another sensitive issue – raising cultural rights for the country ’ s minority kurdish population and giving them increased freedom of expression .
it allows the kurds television and radio broadcasts in the kurdish language as long as they follow constitutional principles and do not incite violence .
expatriot kurds living in europe have been broadcasting via satellite to turkey for years , much to the anger of the turkish state , which routinely accuses the channels of acting as mouthpieces for the separatist rebels of the pkk .
the reforms also enable private schools to teach in languages other than turkish on the condition that they do not violate the constitution .
the strongest opposition to key reforms empowering the kurdish population has come from the mhp , who fear that allowing freedoms for the kurdish language might encourage armed seperatism in turkey ’ s kurdish-dominated south-east .

it hopes that will propel the country forward on its path to the european union . in the face of stiff opposition mainly from the nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- , pro-eu forces in the turkish parliament rushed a far-reaching reform package on early saturday morning .
the package , which was passed after a marathon debate lasting close to 22 hours , includes measures ending punishments for criticism of the armed forces and other pillars of the turkish establishment , outlawing organ and people smuggling , easing restrictions on foreign associations working in turkey as well as on the kurdish language .
no more capital punishment but perhaps the most significant reform foreseen in the package is the abolishment of the death penalty from turkey ’ s civil code , except in times of war or a near war .
turkey is the only country in the european council that has the death penalty enshrined in its constitution , though it has not implemented it for the past 18 years .
the removal of the death penalty will be a relief to turkey ’ s most prominent prisoner – the guerilla leader of the separatist organisation , kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , abdullah ocalan .

expatriot kurds living in europe have been broadcasting via satellite to turkey for years , much to the anger of the turkish state , which routinely accuses the channels of acting as mouthpieces for the separatist rebels of the pkk .
the reforms also enable private schools to teach in languages other than turkish on the condition that they do not violate the constitution .

in her first policy pronouncement since taking over from david davis , mrs may has told the bbc she believes the public will not support the use of taxpayers ' money for this purpose .
her refusal will disappoint a growing band of labour , liberal democrat and even some conservative mps who believe state funding is the only way to take allegations of sleaze out of british politics .
theresa may is the conservatives ' first woman chairman the labour party 's financial difficulties , aggravated by the loss of trade union money and the growing reluctance of the wealthy to make big political donations , have given a new impetus to the campaign to get state funding .
the idea is currently being investigated by the electoral commission .
one idea favoured by many labour and lib dem mps - and a small number of senior conservatives - is for people making donations to get tax relief .
they also want the money people give to political parties to be matched pound for pound by the government .
but mrs may has ruled out any chance of the tories agreeing to use taxpayers ' money in this way .
this means that in the run up to the next general election labour will have to continue relying on funds from the unions and the very rich .
suspicious the bbc 's political correspondent , nicholas jones , said mrs may seems to have calculated the potential embarrassment , because of possible sleaze allegations , is likely to be far greater for labour than the conservatives .
labour has been dogged by sleaze allegations since , amid public pressure , it decided to return a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , after motor racing gained a stay of execution from a ban on tobacco advertising .
in may a substantial majority of people polled for the bbc said they did not want their taxes to be used to fund political parties .
but the survey , conducted by icm for radio 4 's today programme , also found that eight out of ten people think the way political parties currently raise their finances makes people " suspicious of politicians " .

people with hiv / aids are especially vulnerable to hunger the high level of hiv / aids in this small landlocked country has exacerbated the impact of the drought - the worst in more than five years .
a third of the population are hiv positive .
with the food shortages expected to worsen by the end of the year it is forecast that more than 20 % of the million-strong swazi nation will be surviving on aid .
fight for survival people in the south-east of swaziland - where the majority of those affected by the drought live - were celebrating women 's day .
un food aid appeal for southern africa target : more than $ 600m zimbabwe : $ 285m for more than six million people malawi : $ 144m for more than 2.3 million people zambia : $ 71m for more than 2.3 million people mozambique : $ 44m for more than 500,000 people lesotho : $ 41m for nearly 500,000 people swaziland : $ 19 m for nearly 150,000 people $ 6.8m for regional needs the event was not only to mark the huge significance of the work women do in this part of the world .
it was also an opportunity to teach people about how to cope with the food shortages and bring the community together to re-emphasize the significance of hiv / aids in this mountain kingdom .
" it 's really very bad and it 's very much exacerbated by hiv / aids , " pamela megit , from the lutheran development service non-governmental organisation , said .
" so many adults have died that we 're now facing a situation where we 've got 10 % , in this area anyway , of households headed by children .
" that 's children under-18 , or alternatively very old people in their eighties .
people who ca n't work , so those households find it very difficult to survive . "
' change , not giveaways ' food aid is now arriving in the country .
famine crisis : grim trail of famine zambia 's plagues famine in angola malawi 's tragedy zimbabwe 's crops fail lesotho needs food ailing mozambique grain and oil from the us is being distributed through the ngos who know where those most in need are .
swaziland is an absolute monarchy , not a dictatorship , but it is also not classified as a democracy in the western sense .
" this part of the country is really the most dry part , that 's where we have our severe droughts as well , " queen labikiza , one of the king mswati 's nine wives and a campaigner against poverty and hiv / aids said .
" that 's why i think we find ourselves being in a situation of poverty because people in the rural areas most of the time rely on subsistence farming .
" of course , more can be done .
it 's just that our system of governance is rather slow at distributing things the way they should , especially the basic things like water and shelter and stuff like that , but they do try . "
food aid is not , of course , the answer .
the poor and hungry with their failed crops live in view of lush green fields of sugar cane , a commercial crop .
many charity workers in swaziland believe a change of policy from the government is the way to solve the problem in the long term , not giveaways .

it 's sonar - powerful sound waves used by submarines and ships to track activity underwater .
research has shown that the sonar waves can be heard by whales and dolphins - and campaigners believe it may be causing the whales to beach .
the american navy starts using a controversial new low-frequency system next month , even though some types of sonar have already been blamed for causing strandings .
breakfast 's jane o 'brien reports from the coast of cape cod , in the usa click here to watch jane o 'brien 's report in full it was a stranding of rare beak nosed whales in the caribbean which gave scientists their first proof of the harm sonar can inflict .
in spite of the efforts of local people , six whales died. post-mortems showed bleeding post mortem examinations found that their inner ears had been severely damaged each whale ear was sliced into a thousand sections and stained to reveal bone and blood .
red areas show the bleeding caused by exposure to military sonar .
at the moment , we think sonar precipitated the strandings , " says dr darlene ketten .
ketten : believes sonar caused the stranding " the animals were driven to strand by the stress of being exposed to this particular sonar . "
the sonar implicated in this stranding was mid-frequency .
the new system is lower and louder and travels much further .
the noise is the equivalent of a jumbo jet taking off .
the american navy says it needs a more powerful device to keep track of potentially threatening submarines .
but it 's continuing to research into the effects of sonar on marine life .
the us navy says there 's no conclusive proof norman polmar , who 's a consultant to the united states navy says : " there is no finite correlation between low frequency sonar and negative effects on marine wildlife .
" can marine life hear it ?
yes .
does it have a major effect ?
we do n't know . "
this uncertainty alarms wildlife groups .
they 're now threatening legal action to protect sea-life from the sonar .
whale campaigner jo reynolds ' view is unequivocal : " very intense sound can have severe consequences , even death , " he says campaigners are considering legal action " it causes us great concern that the navy proposes to deploy one the loudest sound systems devised by man over 80 per cent of the world 's oceans without really understanding what the implications are . "
whales are already under threat from pollution , fishing nets and collisions with boats .
although the research is inconclusive , conservationists say we should avoid any further risks to them . watch / listen on this story whales jane o 'brien reporting home when we are on air recent forums programme archive studio tour today 's information meet the team presenters reporters your say contact us your comments e-mail this story to a friend links to more breakfast stories in this section running the red soak the rich metrosexual man casualty 's big day rail passengers face above inflation rise the truth about nanotechnology hoover street revival hitchcock blonde when violence begins at home more children suffering from eating disorders calling time on licensing laws the lessons of the trupti patel case open all hours ^ ^ back to top news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes - to bbc sport > > -pipe- to bbc weather > > -pipe- to bbc world service > > - © mmiii -pipe- news sources -pipe- privacy
