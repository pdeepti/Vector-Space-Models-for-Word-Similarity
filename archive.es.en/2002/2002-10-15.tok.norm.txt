brenda blethyn returns to the london stage in the title role of mrs warren 's profession , by george bernard shaw , at the strand theatre from wednesday 2nd october 2002 .
peter hall directs this production of shaw 's once-scandalous play about 19th century moral complacency .
brenda is joined on stage by peter blyth , laurence fox , rebecca hall , richard johnson and james saxon .
the play , which was originally banned by the lord chamberlain , had its first performance in 1902 , eight years after it was written .
brenda plays a woman who discreetly works in prostitution to achieve financial security and a place in polite society .
it is hoped that adding brenda 's name to the cast list will boost ticket sales .
there are even mutterings that she is being groomed to succeed dame judi , maggie smith and vanessa redgrave as britain 's national treasure .
brenda is probably best known from her mike leigh film ' secrets and lies ' in which she plays down-trodden cynthia - a worker in a box factory who is shocked when a young black woman contacts her and tells her that she is the baby that the character played by brenda gave up for adoption 30 years earlier .
her role as cynthia saw her nominated for an oscar .

she was 27 at the time and , realising the risk she was taking , did n't tell her parents just in case it did n't work out as she could always go back to shorthand and typing .

they live in the same " unfashionable " southeast london neighborhood that she moved to five years ago , and she still plans to keep a foot in the theatre as it is her first love .
brenda is an ambassador for the prince 's trust charity .
brenda blethyn talks to bbc news online 's bella hurrell " i ca n't wait for my boyfriend to get here so i can just hide away , " says brenda blethyn , who has been immersed in what she calls the " rather tedious " round of pre-oscar interviews and chat shows in the us .
blethyn was nominated best supporting actress for her role as the foul-mouthed northern floozy mari in the film little voice .
dame judi dench was the winner fo the award - before the ceremony , blethyn said she thought she had " zero " chance of walking away with the award .
but blethyn had been through the whole process before - two years ago she was nominated for the best actress for her role in mike leigh 's secrets and lies .
" i know what to expect now .
i thought i had more chance of winning last time than this time and my optimism was pretty low even then .
but i suppose it is quite a close run thing this year .
i meet people in the street and they say ' oh you 're going to win , you 're going to win ' , but then they said all that last time .
i take it all with a pinch of salt . "
speaking up for little voice mari is a fish factory worker who has nothing but contempt for her shy daughter and lusts after a local showbiz agent , the seedy ray say , played by michael caine .
it is an unsympathetic role and a long way from the put-upon , kind at heart characters blethyn normally plays .
but it was this that attracted her to the role .
" i normally play sympathetic characters .
i also have to understand why she is the way she is .
she is a desperate woman , but she also has an optimistic take on life which i find enviable .
whilst i do n't approve of her behaviour , there is a reason for it and it was my job to work that out .
" i also knew that people might not like her and might not like me .
but where is it written that we must always play nice people ? "
the fact that many fail to distinguish between personality and fine acting irritates blethyn . "
i thought warren beatty was wonderful as bulworth and i thought he 'd be nominated .
and they said ' he wo n't - it 's such a horrible character ' .
" i said ' well , it 's the performance of that horrible character , not the horrible character that we should be looking at . " '
like all the other nominees in hollywood blethyn has been going to a relentless round of parties .
but the down-to-earth blethyn is not angling for sympathy and says it has been fun so far .
" at the nominees luncheon there was a great feeling of camaraderie , everyone comes away with a certificate of nomination and a gift of some sort .
on that particular day there are no winner or losers , in fact they are all winners and that 's quite nice . "
hollywood 's annual fashion show for the big night itself she had a dress specially made , which she describes as " kind of nice " .
diamonds and jewels " come at you from all angles " she admits , referring to the offers that oscar nominees get to wear glamorous jewellery for free as a promotion for the designer .
" it 's as much a celebration of fashion as it is a celebration of film and performance .
every camera crew one stops and talks to on your way up the red carpet wants to know what you 're wearing , who made your shoes , who made the dress , who did your hair , who did your make-up .
i mean it 's bizarre . "
although she looked forward to the chance to dress up , blethyn cautiously admitted that it is a bit of a circus .
" the baftas we are nominated for in april , well they are is probably a little classier . "
back to business blethyn will soon be gracing our screens again in daddy and them , a film with director billy bob thornton which will be released later this year , and another with john hurt called night train .
she is also about to start shooting rko 281 , a film about the making of the citizen kane .
blethyn plays louella parsons , an american gossip columnist .
her hectic schedule starts straight away and involves no sunbathing beside a pool or recuperating from a post-oscars hangover .
leaving hollywood on 22 march - the day after the awards - hopefully with a golden statuette stashed in her hand luggage , she starts shooting in london a day later .
" i wo n't be jetlagged at all , will i ? " she says with a giggle .

and that could spell disappointment for millions of life insurance policy holders , who face the increasing risk of losing billions of pounds through further cuts to the value of their policies .
at least a dozen british life insurers are breaching official solvency requirements , the chief executive of a major uk life company has alleged . "
we find it interesting that we are virtually alone in disclosing that particular fact when quite obviously there are at least a dozen firms in a similar if not a worse position " andrew mohl , chief executive , amp andrew mohl , the new chief executive of amp - which owns the british life insurers pearl , npi and london life - said the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- informed his company that a number of its rivals were also breaching the rules .
" we find it interesting that we are virtually alone in disclosing that particular fact -lsb- of breaching the solvency rules -rsb- when quite obviously there are at least a dozen firms in a similar if not a worse position , " mr mohl said .
" we certainly find it unfair that our fund is named and customers are alarmed when we are pretty much one of a pack . "
worries mount the financial services authority has denied mr mohl 's claims that it has a list of at-risk life insurers .
" we have no idea what mr mohl is referring to or where he is getting his information - certainly not the fsa , " it said in a statement .
the authority reassured investors that even if insurers did suffer a shortfall , they were far from bankrupt .
insurance groups prudential and standard life defended their own positions , with prudential telling bbc news online that it had " one of the strongest free asset ratios in the sector " .

the decision came at the end of a meeting of the economic cooperation organisation -lrb- eco -rrb- in the turkish city of istanbul .
the meeting was held to ensure the pledges of billions of dollars in aid to afghanistan are kept - kabul has received much less aid this year than it had hoped for .
eco members afghanistan azerbaijan iran kazakhstan kyrgyzstan pakistan tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan this was the first eco summit to take place since the taleban were ousted from kabul .
on monday , afghan president of hamid karzai called on the member states to make a firm contribution towards the reconstruction of his country .
a new fund mr karzai also used the first eco summit since he was installed in office to urge rapid progress on a subject close to his heart - the construction of a pipeline through afghanistan that will transport gas between turkmenistan and pakistan .
the pipeline , which would bring badly needed cash into the afghan economy , was originally conceived five years ago but has been on hold during the conflict to oust the taleban .
this forum 's hosts , turkey , are currently playing a key role in kabul , having taken command of the isaf security force .
the emphasis being placed on afghanistan has pushed other important regional issues down the agenda .
these include what is seen as the main purpose of the expanded eco - the integration of the weaker central asian economies with those of its main economic powers , turkey iran and pakistan - eco 's three founder members in 1985 .
their market economies can potentially help guide the others - all former republics of the soviet union - out of their traditional reliance on centralised economic planning .
the summit is also an opportunity for the big three to reflect on ways to draw back from their past regional rivalries and to work in concert for the development of the region as a whole .

their market economies can potentially help guide the others - all former republics of the soviet union - out of their traditional reliance on centralised economic planning .
the summit is also an opportunity for the big three to reflect on ways to draw back from their past regional rivalries and to work in concert for the development of the region as a whole .

the star of television shows this life and sirens travelled to malawi in southern africa as a guest of the third world development charity oxfam .
she had agreed to act as a celebrity campaigner in an attempt to highlight the famine that is threatening 18 million people across the region with starvation .
the charity said an estimated 800,000 children have been orphaned in malawi , where many children are left struggling to keep families together .
ms nardini travelled to the pulula village in the balaka region , where she met three young girls who lived alone .
the oldest , 14-year-old susannah , walks 40 minutes twice a day to fetch water so she can make mavis , 10 , and , patricia , nine , a meal of maize porridge from a supply gifted by oxfam .
daniela , who hails from largs in ayrshire , gave the children a bag of maize which cost about Â£ 6 .
that supply would be enough to feed the girls for about a month .
crops destroyed " we also gave them some toy handbags and silver hairgrips which they really loved , " she said .
" that 's when you realise that they are just wee girls and the enormity of the disaster they are living through really hits you .
" thousands are facing starvation .
we ca n't just sit back and wait for the bodies to start piling up before we begin to help " .
oxfam said more than three million people are already starving in malawi , where droughts and floods have destroyed the maize crop .
the situation has been exacerbated by the aids pandemic which is sweeping the region .
oxfam estimates that up to 30 % of the malawian population is hiv positive .
however , oxfam spokesman alister shields said there was still hope .
" we have a chance to avoid repeating the kind of disaster that we all remember from ethiopia , " he said .
" if the rich world acts now we can reach the hungry before the rainy season makes the roads impassable .
but time is short . "
oxfam has created a southern africa donations page on its website , while donations can also be made by calling 0845 3007070 .

the charity 's comments follow a uk-wide survey which suggests that a lack of training and rehabilitation for people with sight loss early on in their condition was to blame .
the survey , which was published on tuesday , found that services in the province were better than in many parts of the uk .
nine in 10 people questioned said sight was the one sense they most feared losing .
partially sighted given the aging population , it is estimated that the number of people with sight problems will go up by about 25 % in the next 30 years .
the charity predicts one in 12 of the population will become blind or partially sighted by the age of 60 .
it is also believed 24,000 people in the province could be blind or partially sighted - even though only a fraction of that number is actually registered .
one of the biggest problems for health planners is the lack of reliable data on those with vision problems .
that is why following the latest survey the rnib is pressing for a northern ireland sight survey to be carried out . watch / listen on this story bbc ni 's health correspondent dot kirby : " it is reckoned the number with sight problems will go up by 25 % in the next 30 years " see also : 24 aug 00 -pipe- health treatment ' will reverse blindness ' 10 jul 00 -pipe- health lab-grown corneas ' restore sight ' 04 jul 00 -pipe- health doctors fight blindness with eye implant 05 jun 00 -pipe- health eye laser surgery ' risky ' internet links : royal national institute for the blind the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top n ireland stories now : nail bombs thrown at station omagh detectives make arrest orde defends inquiry comments warders still concerned at breach sdlp member ' being forced out ' jobs threat at council family claim attack was ' sectarian ' adair fails in prison challenge links to more n ireland stories are at the foot of the page .

the company said its uk stores sold 2.1 % less in the 28 weeks to 12 october 2002 than in the same period last year , although an improvement on the 3.1 % slide seen three months earlier .
overseas , sales were better , growing 28.9 % and leaving the business overall nursing a slim 0.7 % growth in sales .
but that will leave margins narrower than last year , said the company 's finance director and acting chief executive mark mcmenemy .
" the first half has been disappointing both in sales and profit , " he said , admitting to under-performance in the key children 's clothes department .
turnaround mothercare has had a rough ride in recent years .
a new warehouse system comprehensively failed to work , leaving stores with the wrong stock at the wrong time and badly denting the company 's brand .
in the last financial year , pre-tax profits slumped from Â£ 10.2m to Â£ 4.2m.
now , mr mcmenemy said , the turnaround is under way and the second half of the year should be better .
a new chief executive , ben gordon - walt disney 's former head of disney stores in europe and the asia pacific region - will join the company on 2 december .
but he warned that despite improvements to the stock tracking systems , costs " are not yet coming down as anticipated " .
" mothercare continues to work to reduce these costs as a matter of urgency , " he said . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's marcia hughes " some stores have risen to recent challenges better than others " see also : 22 sep 02 -pipe- business mothercare appoints new chief 15 jul 02 -pipe- business mothercare looks for new boss 23 may 02 -pipe- business stock mistakes cut mothercare profits 15 jan 02 -pipe- business mothercare hit by warehouse woes internet links : mothercare the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : hacker breaches credit card security job losses escalate at reuters new sec chief pledges tough line oil prices push higher rwanda denies drc plundering overseas sales drive wal-mart congo 's finance minister resigns blair keeps euro options open links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .
