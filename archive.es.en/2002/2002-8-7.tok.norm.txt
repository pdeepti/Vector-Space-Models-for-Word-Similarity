the warning comes from the british medical association which monitors the hours and working conditions of health service professionals .
some 4,700 new doctors who have just finished medical school are due to start work at hospitals on the same day . "
life is tough for newly-qualified doctors " dr trevor pickersgill , bma in the past they could work up to 100 hours a week , but since august 2001 , their rotas have been limited to 56 hours a week .
it was set at that in an attempt to gradually bring it into line with the european time directive of a 48-hour limit .
it was hoped that would be achievable by 2009 .
fast pace but the bma thinks many will start their career working far more hours than the 56-hour limit .
" life is tough for newly-qualified doctors , " said junior doctors leader dr trevor pickersgill .
" although working hours are slowly coming down , the pace of hospital life has intensified , with more acutely ill patients being treated and shorter stays in hospital . "
junior doctors - known professionally as pre-registration house officers - work for one year before earning their full registration with the general medical council .
then they become a senior house officer for three or four years before taking specialist training .
dr evan harris , liberal democrat health spokesman , said : " the fundamental problem is the government 's failure to expand the number of consultants to do work currently done by junior doctors , and to provide greater supervision within reduced hours .
" as a result , the sickest patients tend to be seen late at night by the least experienced doctors .
" in many cases , as these figures show , junior doctors are likely to be sleep deprived or frantically busy . "
government response a department of health spokeswoman said this was the first government to take the 56-hour maximum working week seriously .
she said : " all trusts are now required to include a maximum of 56 hours work a week in all contracts of employment for new junior doctors .
" this will include all other doctors in training from august 2003 . "
she said a national monitoring exercise , carried out by the department in march this year , found that 95 % of all pre-registration house officers met the targets of working a maximum of 56 hours a week with appropriate breaks .
" we are working closely with the medical profession to ensure that all juniors benefit from the reducing hours , " she said .

us congressional investigators have asked ms stewart for e-mails and other records , as part of their probe into her sale of shares in drugmaker imclone .
ms stewart sold her shares late last year just before the company 's stock plummeted following the rejection of its application to license a new anti-cancer drug .
in a letter to ms stewart 's lawyer , the house energy and commerce committee reiterated its request for an interview with ms stewart .
the committee wants to clarify discrepancies between her account of the sale and that of her broker and his assistant .
however , ms stewart declined to meet with the investigators , maintaining that such an interview would be premature .
crossed wires in her account of the share sale , she says that her broker had an order to sell imclone if the stock went below $ 60 . "
clearly someone is lying to us and we want to find out who it is " ken johnson spokesman for the house committee as a result of this , almost 4,000 shares were sold on 27 december , a day before the drug license was turned down .
but her broker peter bacanovic of merrill lynch has a different version of when the order to sell the shares was placed .
there is also confusion over a supposed phone call that took place between the broker 's assistant , douglas faneuil , and ms stewart , where he reportedly advised her to sell the shares .
phone records obtained by the committee show no record of such a call .
" clearly someone is lying to us and we want to find out who it is , " said ken johnson , a spokesman for the house committee .
sam waksal , imclone 's former chairman and a close friend of ms stewart , was arrested on insider-trading charges on 12 june .
cooperation ?
ms stewart 's lawyer said they would try to comply with the committee 's request for additional documents .
congressman on the committee have hinted that ms stewart 's cooperation with the committee has not been sufficient , raising the prospect that they might subpoena her .
as chief executive and chairman of martha stewart living omnimedia , ms stewart also faces a law suit from a disgruntled shareholder .
the shareholder - known as conrad hahn - claims that he has suffered losses of $ 75,000 as a result of ms stewart becoming embroiled in the insider-trading scandal .

the honour , which was approved by the queen , is to recognise mr greenspan 's " contribution to global economic stability " , the uk treasury said .
mr greenspan , who makes crucial decisions about raising or cutting us interest rates , will receive the award when he next visits the uk , possibly in the early autumn .
" the award is in recognition of ... the benefit that the uk has received from the wisdom and skill , " a treasury spokesman added .
cryptic messages mr greenspan , sometimes referred to as the most powerful man in the world because of his control over the us economy , is also famous for his ability to keep the markets and the politicians guessing .
wall street listens when mr greenspan speaks he once famously said : " if i seem unduly clear to you , you must have misunderstood what i said . "
as chairman of the fed , he is required to go before congress at least twice a year to give his assessment of the us economic situation .
in his most recent testimony , he told the senate that the us economy was set to recover despite recent stock market volatility .
" with profitable opportunities for malfeasance markedly diminished , far fewer questionable practices are likely to be initiated in the immediate future , " he said .
his accounts of the economy have traditionally been cryptic - and closely watched .
a gift for figures mr greenspan , 76 , was born the son of a stockbroker and showed a gift for figures at a early age .
in the 1950s , he left academia to become a professional economist .
during the 1970s he was president gerald ford 's top economic adviser , and took up chairmanship of the fed just before the stock market crash of 1987 .
his fourth four-year term as fed chairman ends in 2004 , when he is widely expected to retire .

hendrix , who died in london in 1970 at the age of 27 , won the most votes in a survey conducted by total guitar .
the results show that hendrix was considered a greater guitar talent than led zeppelin 's jimmy page - at number two - and former cream member turned soloist eric clapton , who came in at three .
hendrix made his name in the late 1960s , rising to fame throughout the world with hits such as purple haze , hey joe and voodoo chile .
magazine editor scott rowley said the poll showed his readers were impressed by true talent rather than image .
" what 's nice about it is that it 's not some music critic 's opinion of the best guitarists .
" these guys might not be cool by any music critic 's viewpoint , but they genuinely are the fastest , loudest , most exciting players in rock and roll . "
following hendrix , page and clapton were slash from guns n ' roses at four and brian may of queen at five .
readers ' votes were not reserved for the older generation of guitarists as younger talents also made the top 100 .
jonny greenwood of radiohead came in at 35 and noel gallagher from oasis at 50 .
johnny ramone of the ramones - known for playing three-chord rock - was 88th .
however , women fared badly in the results after tracy chapman was the only female to be included by the magazine in a list of 440 nominees .
rowley said women were not as " geeky or competitive " about music as men .
" instead of showing off , they 're trying to write a good song .
which is probably smarter , " he added .

tens of thousands of people in parts of the city are still having to boil their water because of higher than normal levels of the cryptosporidium parasite in supplies .
the results of further tests on the tap water are expected on wednesday .
we must make sure that steps are put in place to get this put right sooner rather than later douglas miller glasgow chamber of commerce more than 140,000 people in glasgow and clydebank are still being advised to boil their water for preparing food , bathing babies and brushing teeth .
health staff have predicted that the scare , which came after the parasite was found in supplies from mugdock reservoir in milngavie , east dunbartonshire , could be over by the weekend .
dr jim mcmenamin , chairman of the incident control team , said they were " encouraged " that no cases of illness had yet been reported .
however , douglas miller of the glasgow chamber of commerce told bbc radio scotland that hotel , catering and food manufacturing businesses were suffering .
" i do n't know of any businesses that have had to close , but i do know that businesses have had to cut production and alter the ways in which food preparation is carried out .
heavy rain " that is slowing them down and hitting their profits , " he said .
businesses are also afraid that there could be a repeat of the alert if there is more heavy rain in weeks to come .
" that is a great concern and we must make sure that steps are put in place to get this put right sooner rather than later . "
more than 140,000 people are affected he said the public was becoming very concerned about the situation .
" i know householders are beginning to say that they want compensation and businesses are saying they are wanting compensation , " said mr miller .
" scottish water have failed so far to come forward with any form of compensation or any form of indication that they are going to make compensation .
" i think the first thing we are doing today is asking them to come clean and tell us what they are going to do . "
he said the chamber of commerce would gather the views of the businesses community then request a meeting with scottish water to " take matters further " .
continuing scare " there is a cost involved in this and scottish water ca n't get away with it , " he added .
those pressing for compensation include the holiday inn hotel in bothwell street .
general manager alastair bruce estimated that the incident had already cost the business about £ 1,500 .
" the problem is that we do n't know when the scare is going to end , so this could continue into next week .
the issue of compensation is a real one , it is something that does have to be considered allan sutherland water industry commissioner " i would estimate that it is going to cost between £ 4,000 and £ 4,500 .
" i think that the very least we would be looking for is compensation in those terms , " he said .
water industry commissioner allan sutherland said there were a number of events which could trigger compensation payments .
however , he said that the " significant inconvenience " experienced in glasgow was not akin to the interruption of supplies which was required to meet one of the tests .
and he warned that if compensation was payable it would in effect be paid for by other customers - either through increased charges or further delays in much-needed investment .
highest priority " the issue of compensation is a real one , it is something that does have to be considered , " he said .
" but at this point i would say that those customers who have particular special needs need to be dealt with as the highest priority .
" we need to focus on getting things sorted out .
once that has been done there can be discussions about compensation . "
scottish water has set up a helpline on 0845 600 88 55 .
anyone concerned about their health should contact nhs scotland on 0800 22 44 88 .
full details of streets affected are on the scottish water website .

pakistan has condemned the attack as a " cowardly act of terrorism " .

police found a note left at the scene claiming the attack was in revenge for the ill-treatment of muslims in afghanistan and elsewhere .
the note was reportedly sent by a previously unknown group called al-intiqami al-pakistani -lrb- revenge of the pakistanis -rrb- .
islamic groups are also accused of carrying out two bomb attacks on foreign targets in the southern city of karachi since march , killing 26 people .
the authorities suspect most of these attacks have been carried out either by members of al-qaeda or their supporters in pakistan .

the new figures show donations to labour have dropped by 83 % in the last three months , with the party now said to be £ 8m in the red . "
donors are torn to shreds , they are surrounded by unsubstantiated allegations about their motives for giving " peter mandelson mr mandelson said such debts were inevitable in a post-election year but argued donation rows were paving the way for more state funding .
he accused the conservatives of " compound hypocrisy " for opposing the idea when they have received more than £ 1m in public funds between april and june this year .
everton boost the electoral commission has just published the list of large donations for those three months .
the biggest donation came from the owner of everton football club , bill kenwright , who gave the labour party £ 200,000 .
the largest conservative windfall was from sir stanley kalms , chairman of the dixons store chain , who last year became the tories ' treasurer and chief fund raiser .
but the party also received £ 1,977,807 in grants given to fund the work of opposition parties .
such money is aimed at helping research rather than for campaigning .
tony blair has said cross-party consensus would be needed before more general state funding of parties could be introduced .
new tory chairman theresa may said this week .
" we have consistently said that we do n't believe in the concept of state funding . "
donor backlash it was that attitude which prompted mr mandelson , speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , to accuse the conservatives of double standards .
the former minister said labour supporters were still giving the party financial backing , with £ 4m in donations received this year .
he questioned how long such gifts could continue when donors came under fierce media pressure .
" the fact is that when people , including large donors , contribute to the party , they attract an enormous amount of adverse publicity , " said mr mandelson .
" they are torn to shreds , they are surrounded by unsubstantiated allegations about their motives for giving . "
mr mandelson played down talk of financial crisis for labour .
" i have never known a year following a general election when the labour party has not been in the red , " he said .
wasted money ?
the hartlepool mp argued the public would be prepared to pay to ensure a democracy where more than just one party could put up candidates .
mark seddon , a member of labour 's national executive committee , said cutting down on unnecessary advertising , not state funding , was the answer to donations rows .
but mr mandelson countered : " elections need to stimulate interest , they need to mobilise the involvement of people , you have to get arguments going . "
conservative finances the latest figures show the conservatives received £ 1.9m in donations between april and june .
labour was given donations worth £ 591,000 and the liberal democrats received £ 214,000 .
the figures bear out conservative claims that their finances are in " a healthy position " .
the party has , however , yet to publish figures for the last financial year , covering the general election .
labour has admitted it is heavily in debt .
last month the party general secretary , david triesman , accepted that labour was £ 5m to £ 6m in the red and said that the party faced " financial challenges " in getting back into the black .

our unique operating model will allow us to pass on low operating costs to the customer , while maintaining the highest standards of service and reliability mytravellite chief tim jeans the new airline , mytravellite , is due to begin services on 1 october this year .
based at birmingham airport , mytravellite will initially fly to belfast , geneva , alicante , malaga and beauvais airport near paris .
one-way fares will start at £ 19 to belfast , £ 24 to paris and geneva , and £ 29 to alicante and malaga .
mytravellite will start with a fleet of just two aircraft , but will add two more in time for the summer of 2003 .
the airline is also in talks with glasgow prestwick airport about launching services to and from scotland .
low fares pledge mytravellite managing director tim jeans - formerly sales and marketing director at no-frills pioneer ryanair - said the new airline would offer travellers " the lowest airfares from the region 's largest and most convenient airport . "
" our unique operating model will allow us to pass on low operating costs to the customer , while maintaining the highest standards of service and reliability , " he said in a statement .
like the established no-frills carriers , mytravellite plans to encourage passengers to book flights online in order to hold down costs .
it also plans to tie in its flights with offers to stay at hotels owned by its parent company .
mytravel , formerly named airtours , made clear its intention to muscle in on the lucrative budget airline market in may this year .
the announcement came just a week after easyjet , one of the strongest contenders in the sector , said that its talks to buy rival go had been successful .
growth prospects mytravellite 's debut comes amid spectacular growth in the no-frills travel sector .
easyjet said on wednesday that passenger numbers for july had grown by 62 % on the year to just over one million , while its new subsidiary go saw traffic jump by 59 % to 645,600 .
the combined figure confirms that the easyjet / go has displaced ryanair - which carried 1.4 million passengers in july - as europe 's largest budget carrier .
but analysts predict that the rise in passenger figures will level off over the next two years , forcing budget airlines to compete more aggressively .
shares in mytravellite 's parent company were up 1 penny at 140.5p in late morning trade .
easyjet was 10p higher at 370p while ryanair was up 5p at 392.5p. watch / listen on this story the bbc 's simon montague " the new airline 's got some catching up to do " tim jeans , mytravel " mytravel is going to become a major force in the low fares business " see also : 05 aug 02 -pipe- wales 10,000 flyers snap up cheap seats 06 aug 02 -pipe- business ryanair profits take off 29 jul 02 -pipe- uk the passengers are revolting 29 jul 02 -pipe- business q & a : air passengers ' rights 25 jul 02 -pipe- wales no-frills airline reveals routes 05 jul 02 -pipe- business budget airlines see demand soar 02 jul 02 -pipe- uk is a cheap flight enough to tempt you to klagenfurt ? 26 may 02 -pipe- business german firm ' to start budget carrier ' internet links : mytravel the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : hacker breaches credit card security job losses escalate at reuters new sec chief pledges tough line oil prices push higher rwanda denies drc plundering overseas sales drive wal-mart congo 's finance minister resigns blair keeps euro options open links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .
